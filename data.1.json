            "Here's some of the main reasons:\n\nBidets have been associated with French prostitutes for a long time. So they're seen as being a kinky thing more than a hygiene thing by many people. You can also see this depiction in some animes they make a joke about it where someone has an embarrassed aroused face from being surprised when the cleaning occurs. \n\nBidets also take some adjustment to get used to. Not just the adjustment of setting the pressure and angle, but also just the actual mechanics of having water only hit that one part of your body. \n\nThere's also general imagined problems. People associate the results with cleaning mud off a car and the mud sprays everywhere.\n\nThe biggest part is cultural most likely. Europe has had plumbing systems for ~2000 years with Rome developing aqueducts. Water supplies in both countries are quite different. Much of rural America has had wells to draw water from. Fountains in general were never a big thing in America. Although it should be noted that Kansas City has the most fountains of any city in the world.

            "It depends. One person is the DM (Dungeon Master). They can either run one of the *many* prebuilt stories or make their own up. As long as there are more ideas you can keep playing indefinitely, or you can finish a specific story for a group of characters and be done.",
            "Like they said before it depends, but its mostly of the time a bit unpredictable, at least in the games I usually play, since there is some sense of freedom for the characters and for the Dm, things can just change drastically with a simple thought and a lucky/unlucky roll. I think that's what I most like about playing D&D. That even tho there could be a script, the results are unpredictable.",
            "Although the game has a pretty deep, complicated set of rules groups are free to follow or ignore them as closely as they like as long as everyone is having fun. Same goes with how the story progresses, some groups may want to try to stick to the story that the Game Master is trying to tell while others are perfectly happy to hold off on fighting the evil wizard that wants to take over the kingdom and just goof around instead.\n\nPlayers are free to decide to do just about anything they can think of during a game with the likelihood of success being decided by a combination of dice rolls and bonuses or penalties given by skills, equipment and attributes chosen by the players for their characters. A master thief wearing magic boots that silence his footsteps will have an easier time sneaking past a prison guard than a knight wearing heavy, clunky armor for example. The Game Master has the authority to decide what the players should be allowed to do but the game is more about collaborating and improvising with each other than it is about winning or losing.",
            "The story and plotlines of D&D honestly are up to the players and DM (Dungeon Master).  Dice are the tools that you use as the player to \"control\" their characters. They're kinda like flipping a coin.  If you want to attack someone then you need to get a high enough roll on dice to successfully do so.  Another example is if I wanted to try and steal something, I would have to get a high roll on dice to successfully do so.\n\nThere are pre-made oneshots that you can do, which is basically just short stories that have fairly definitive progression and endings.  For example, I was in a oneshot recently where we, the PCs, had to look for a missing child and when we did that's just where the story ended.  \n\nIn my opinion, a full campaign is more fun because the plot and story is basically left up to the creativity and imagination of the DM and the players.  These campaigns are long term and can last for months to even years if you're lucky.  From what I've experienced, the DM makes a somewhat loose storyline and leaves it up to the players to do what they want.  DMs should be able to subtly guide or nudge the characters in the direction they want, but they don't just force you to do something.  Right now in my main campaign, we're joining rebels overthrow the corrupt government but in reality, there was nothing stopping us from just leaving if we wanted to.  Our DM might have been a little sad that we just left his thought out story, but good DMs should be able to make changes on the fly for the randomness that PCs can and will try to do.",
            "Sometimes there's an end goal, but sometimes it's a string of smaller goals. Think of it as more like an improv play. The dungeon master is the director and guides the plot, but you have free control over your one character. Your actions can influence the direction the DM goes with the plot, but she's still in the director's chair. \n\nBut to prevent you from just doing whatever you want (like having way too much power, always succeeding at everything, etc) and add some realism, there is a system of numbers and random probability (dice rolling) that will give you parameters for what your character is able to do. These rules are created by a bunch of people who get paid to try and make the game fair for all types of characters and they publish it in a book. D&D players \"buy\" the book(s) and use it to create their characters so that the game is balanced and no one person can take over the story. There are several different editions of these books with different rules, and there's several other similar games with different rules and different settings (like for star wars, for instance).\n\nMy group usually plays a game for a few months or so until we get tired of that particular one and decide to switch to a different one.",
            "Imagine you were telling your friends a story, except each one of your friends has full control over one of the main characters in your story. It\u2019s basically collective story telling, where the Dungeon Master creates settings, conflicts, and characters, and the players then interact with that world by telling the Dungeon Master what they want to do. The rules are just there to keep things consistent and fair.",

            "The dungeon master is tasked with making the roleplay interesting and engaging for players. They choose the way the world works and populate it with characters. While a good DM will be able to generally direct characters in the direction of the story, it is quite common for players to unintentionally derail the story. When this happens, the DM has to decide if they want to try and bring the players back into their original story or figure out a new story for the players to follow that makes more sense given their new situation.\n\nUltimately, the players and DM cooperate to tell stories, and dice make the tough decisions.",
            "The way I describe it to people is that the players are the Dragonborn, the DM is the game disk. \n\nThe players completely control their characters, but noting else. The DM has the story, but it\u2019s dependent on the players. If I want to focus on the civil war story, but the players want to spend 40 hours building a house, then we build a house.",
            "D&D is a huge set of rules. Such as combat, classes, etc. \n\nThe game is 100% up to the DM and players. Usually the DM makes up a story, or can use a prebuilt story. However, players can do anything they want. The DM has to adjust his plans accordingly. The DM also has the opportunity to bend rules as they see fit. Pretty much D&D is a guideline, and the DM does what they want."

        "bestcomment": [
            "Yes, they really do. The batteries themselves can be used for a long time and are recyclable when they've finally reached the end of their useful life. For power generation, many places have clean energy powering their grids (my local power is almost entirely hydroelectric, for example). Even in the worst scenario of a coal-heavy area, electric cars are still better because power plants are so much more efficient at generating energy than tiny automobile engines, and can make use of larger and more sophisticated filtering technologies. Additionally, the power grids are getting progressively cleaner so even if a car was being primarily powered by coal today, its carbon footprint will shrink over time as the grid improves. A gas-powered car starts off polluting and will keep doing so forever, never getting any better.",
            "\"**Do electric vehicles actually have a smaller carbon footprint** \"\n\nYes, drastically. IIRC, a bigger battery car like a Tesla takes about 3\\~ years to become carbon neutral. A smaller battery series-hybrid like a Volt takes under a year, since its battery is much smaller.\n\n**\"the amount of rare earth metals in the batteries**\"\n\nThe only real footprint to care about is lithium mining, which is where batteries start looking bad with that upfront cost compared to fuel tanks which is just metal molded to a shape. That lithium battery will produce virtually no emissions in its lifetime while the fuel-tank will linearly cause more emissions as you burn through more fuel, so eventually the battery + electricity is more efficient than fuel tank + gas. As I said, that's about 1-3 years depending on the car.\n\n\"**fossil fuels used to generate the power to charge them**\"\n\nIf you lived in a place where 100% of the power you use to fuel your car was made from coal, your electric vehicle would still be running cleaner than a gas car. This is because of the efficiency we can squeeze out energy from products at the scales of power plants. A small V8 engine is actually really really inefficient at burning and capturing the energy from gasoline when we compare it to a power plant thats powered by gasoline. It's just not a process we can scale down to fit in a car without simplifying things heavily.\n\nThe greener the source of energy, the lower the footprint obviously. But capturing energy at scale, and then charging your car through the power grid is much greener than capturing the energy in the car while you drive, regardless.\n\nThis is my ELI5 IIRC recollection. For a better detailed explanation, I recommend [Engineering Explained on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RhtiPefVzM) Very informative guy who breaks things down very cleanly. If my 1-3 year memory was wrong above, take his numbers over mine, I'm just trying to remember what the video said without rewatching it lol",

There certainly are issues with electric vehicles, they are not perfect, but they are far cleaner than traditional cars.",
            "Yes.  It takes a couple years of use, so you can't get a new car every three years.  \n\nAnd many power plants use renewable energy sources.  Coal plants that get old are getting shut down across the globe instead of investing in repairs or modernization.",

            "Rare earth metals in the batteries is a valid point, but electric cars cost less to make / service as their motors are simpler.\n\nElectric cars are maybe 80% efficient (compared to 15% petrol and 20% diesel), and we are getting more and more electricity from renewables. Petrol and diesel *have* to use fossil fuels, and less efficiently.",
            "Lots of good answers here, but you may try asking in r/eli5 or r/askscience if you're still curious.",
            "Im going to say it depends. Think about how many fossil fuels are being used to get those vehicles made. From mining the minerals to building factories to transporting materials. Tractors that use diesel are probably mining the minerals, then loaded onto big diesel rigs that transport it to and airport, put on planes which are using fuel, then back in more diesel trucks to get to the plant which was built using big trucks. Then once built they\u2019re probably put onto another diesel truck to go to the final destination. Sure, over time they\u2019re probably better but it\u2019s going to be a long time before you reach that \u201cbreak even\u201d point."

Obviously you had to be sure not to shoot your own wings with something like that. It\u2019s certainly not a new idea and has been done before.\n\nMost of these planes also had fixed forwards facing guns, which are allowed to be a bit more powerful due to having a solid attachment rather than a rotating one.",

The reason for this is because bombers in ww2 were huge and slow, and needed to have guns pointed in every direction so they could fight back against fighter airplanes.\n\nIn modern times this is not useful.

I've read somewhere that there were some experiments, but overall they're not very practical and of dubious value other than the 'cool factor'.\n\nAlso, if the enemy's behind you, you'd better worry about getting out of their crosshairs - maneuvering, hitting the afterburners, and calling on your other fighters to get them off of you.  To get a good firing solution on them, you'd have to give them a good firing solution on you."

            "Cameras in mobile devices mostly use wide-angle lenses so that they give you a decent field of view without you having to hold the phone 5 yards away from your face. Wide-angle lenses distort the picture they show you (think fish-eye effect if it's taken to extremes), but with most mobile phones that effect is so slight that you can barely notice it.\n\nWhere you *do* notice it, unconsciously, however, is with your face, because our brains are insanely good and very specialized in looking at faces and spotting the tiniest inconsistencies.\n\nOne effect of wide-angle lenses is that what is closer to the lens gets enlarged a bit too much - and in a selfie that's usually your nose. So, depending on the angle of view, any selfie distorts the shape of your face and your nose. Take a look at these photos how different a face looks when photographed with lenses with varying focal lengths:\n\n[http://www.danvojtech.cz/blog/2016/07/amazing-how-focal-length-affect-shape-of-the-face/](http://www.danvojtech.cz/blog/2016/07/amazing-how-focal-length-affect-shape-of-the-face/)\n\nThere are studies that nose-jobs from young women are on the rise since the wide-spread adoption of smart phones because girls think the nose they see in their selfies is their actual nose. It's not.\n\nEDIT: So some people who look perfect in selfies sometimes have a face that is just a little off in real life. In those instances, the wide-angle lens effect actually \"improves\" the image. Tiny, short noses for example profit from a head-on close-up through a wide-angle lens.\n\nEDIT 2: The further away from your face the camera is, the less pronounced the distortion effect becomes. So use a selfie stick and crop the resulting picture (zoom in). It will be better than a photo taken from up close.",
            "You\u2019re more comfortable with your mirror image because that\u2019s all you see. Slight facial asymmetry will cause you to look differently when you see an opposite view. People who see you in real life all the time probably prefer that view as opposed to what you see in the mirror.\n\nFocal length in cameras can also mess with your facial proportions and make it look different than what you normally see.",
            "Lighting and focal lengths.  The lighting around the mirror might be really good.  Also, wide angle lenses like on your smartphone doesn't take great photos of your face.  Generally a wide angle lens does great for landscapes and a tele lens does better for portraits.",

This honestly has to be the most accurate and easiest depiction of yourself but it's still not fully accurate since most mirrors are found in toilets...which limits your appearance to indoor lighting only\n\nB) of yourself standing at least 1 metre away from the camera lens and position the camera at your eye-level. This emulates the same image you should see in A. This is because you're always looking at yourself at eye-level when you look in the mirror. The 1 metre distance is get rid of most of the lens distortion\n\nAlso I recommend a video since it captures how you are in real life: A moving you. Not a stationary you.\n\nThese are all the factors I know of that can change your image:\n\n- camera focal lens distortion\n\n- mirror's invertedness\n\n- how you always only see yourself at eye-level (imagine a short person looking up at you or a tall person looking down at you. you'll look very diff to them, right?)\n\n- lighting (indoors vs outdoors, shadows)\n\n\nremove all these and bam, your perfect accurate image (that isn't fake)",
            "Selfies are one of the worst ways to see how you really look. People who are good at it have a) lucky genes (especially your colouring plays a lot into how your skin photographs) b) have taken 1000s of selfies to practice, know how to work the angles and light direction, and probably take dozens of selfies every time and choose only the best one to publish. You just never see them looking like a boiled potato in a selfie because those get deleted.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n If you want to get a good photo of yourself, go to a professional photographer. Things like the focal length  make a massive difference to how you look in photos, and a skilled portrait photographer knows how to choose the right equipment to make you look good.",

            "Simple: you're not good at taking photos. Photography is rarely an accurate depiction of real life, which is why it's an art to take good photos. Just because you're bad at taking good photos doesn't make you ugly, it makes your photographs ugly. Learn to separate real life from photography and you'll likely be much happier."

            "> And what\u2019s the big difference between the $250 vs $1200 TV that are both 4K, smart and the same size.\n\nThe difference between a cheap and expensive screen is about the same for 4K now as it was for 1080p 10-15 years ago - colour gamut, dynamic range, refresh rate and response time:\n\n[**Colour gamut:**](https://www.wideformatonline.com/index.php/workshops/colour-management/801-colour-gamut-in-laymans-terms.html) The sum total of all colours that can be accurately shown by each pixel.\n\nCheaper displays with a smaller gamut are more likely to show blocks of flat colour where there should be subtle gradations, which can really mess with shading and gradients like skin and fabric.\n\n[**Dynamic Range:**](https://kmbcomm.com/demystifying-high-dynamic-range-hdr-wide-color-gamut-wcg/): While gamut maps all the available colours in a 2D space, dynamic range adds a 3rd axis from light to dark. High Dynamic Range (HDR) gives you brighter whites and darker blacks at the same time in the same image, resulting in a picture that's far closer to what you can see with the naked eye.\n\nIf you've ever tried to take a photo indoors of an object in front of a window with sunlight outside you'll know what I mean. Your eyeball can see inside and out just fine, but without HDR you either have a washed-out white square for the window, or gloomy shadows for everything inside.\n\n[**Refresh Rate:**](https://www.cnet.com/news/ultra-hd-4k-tv-refresh-rates/): This is how many times per second the display throws up a new frame - nowadays it's usually 60Hz or 120Hz, albeit with so much marketing bullshit stapled on you'll have to dig for expert reviews to get to the truth for any given model.\n\nIf the video stream/source is at a lower framerate, some displays can automatically generate interpolated frames to keep things smooth, which is sometimes great and sometimes weirdly creepy. However, regardless of whether or not you need to fine-tune or turn off your TV's smoothing functions, a higher refresh rate is pretty much always better to have.\n\n[**Response Time:**](https://lcdtvbuyingguide.com/lcdtv/lcdtv-responsetime.shtml) This is the time in milliseconds it takes each individual pixel to physically switch from one colour to the next. It's probably the single most important spec for LCD sets, I don't actually know how it works for other display technologies. Smaller is better, provided you're comparing apples to apples, because again the marketing bullshit is strong.\n\nThe gold standard is TrTf/BTB (Time rising/falling or Black-to-Black, basically a pixel going from Black to White to Black again) but some manufacturers use GTG (Grey to White to Grey) which is obviously shorter but also closer to what a pixel is actually doing most of the time unless there's a strobe light going off on screen. Some manufacturers try to get away with only quoting BTW (Black to White) just so they can pretend their smaller number is better, but they can get fucked.\n\nA slow response time (TrTf 14ms or more) results in smearing trails and motion blur of fast-moving objects, while a fast response time (ideally less than 8ms) keeps everything crisp even when it's in motion. If you need to just eyeball it, watch some sports or check the text on a sign or poster as the camera pans across it to get a good visual check.",
            "If you want a true 4K TV, you're going to be spending around $1K for a 50-inch. The cheaper ones are hardly better than 1080p TVs (and in some cases worse). They can have motion blur/jittering, less ports for HDMI and USB, uneven lighting, washed out blacks, and other issues.\n\nEDIT: Downvoting facts doesn't make them stop being facts. Go to /r/4kTV and find anyone who disagrees."

After the water come to a boil, add your rice and a little salt, stir once and cover.  reduce heat to about med/low.\n\nI know this seem basic but normally people add rice to water and wonder why it doesn't turn out.  In most professional kitchens you almost always get use to putting something into boiling water, or something that is already hot.\n\nThe problem with starting off cold is one day the water will come out 70 degrees, the next it might come out 45.

If you spend more then pay excess down early.  \n\nThis approach will build your credit rating.",

You're not liable for illegal purchases, you're not going to risk your cash being stolen from your debit card and you're teaching yourself good habits. If you always pay off your balance, they'll literally be paying you to establish good credit, which will lend to lower interest rates, better rentals, a lot of good things.\n\nI think I've gotten \\~$800 in rewards this year and I have no paid a dime in interest or fees.

There are plenty of cards with no annual fees. \n\nYou also don't need to spend a lot of money on it either. The test is \"Do they pay as promised\", not \"How much money can they spend?\".

Your key can be designed to work with eight of these pins, but then only use six for your room and the remaining two for the bathrooms. As such, the remaining two can be the same on everyone's keys while keeping the first six varied. The exact way this is done is up to whoever made your key system.",
            "Regular ol' pin tumbler locks work because the lock cylinder contains some number of pin slots, and each contains (in addition to a top pin) different-sized driver pins.  The jagged part of your key lifts each driver pin up just right so that the pins line up with the cylinder, which allows you to turn it.  Other keys push one or more driver pins up too high or not enough so that when you try to turn the lock, it's blocked by the pin and won't turn.\n\nYour bathroom locks could be working in a few different ways:\n\n* All of the building's keys are the same in some pin positions, and only differ in the other pin positions.  The bathroom lock only contains pins in the common spots.\n\n* The bathroom is pinned with multiple tiny little pins in each position, so that multiple key heights will work.  The lock is set up so that it will work with any of the keys to the building, but each room lock is set up to only work with a specific key bitting.  This is how master keyed systems work (individual keys open individual doors, but a master key also works on every door), but backwards (individual doors can be opened by individual keys, but some doors work with any of the keys).\n\n* The bathroom locks are actually pinned up so that any key actually works, and they're just sorta relying on no one noticing or caring that much.\n\n> Is there any way that another resident could use their key to open my door?\n\nIt's always possible that someone with the same kind of key as yours just so happens to have the same bitting.  There's a limited number of how many unique bittings are possible with each kind of key/lock.  Somewhere out there is probably another lock that works with your key, too.",

Especially on 3rd down, unless they are in FG range the loss from getting the penalty called isn't nearly equal to a possible first down. \n\nAs for offsides, the offense will often do fakes to try and get someone offsides.",

Could another plane emergency refuel it?",

This mean the engines will burn for about 12.7 hours, assuming that the engines will work until the very last drop.  Cruising speed is close to 500 knots, so the engines will push the plane for about 6350 nautical miles.\n\nNow, you would also have to calculate how far the plane will continue to move ahead once the engines die.  The momentum of the plane could carry it for a while, and continue to do so until the plane hits the surface.  If you have a good pilot, he could keep the plane in the air for longer by hitting thermals, like what a glider pilot does.  I don't know what this number would be."

Or so I have read.",

Short meditation, let's say 2 minutes a day, can be useful to.\nBut the main thing about meditation is to get to that Zen state, being able to concentrate on only your breath for how long you want, and doing it constantly. That will help you to get more control on your emotions, even if you only meditate for 2 minutes per day.\nThink about this, if your mind is used to be quiet on demand, the next time you get into an argument it won't affect you that much because you will be able to chill, having more time to think better. No one likes that friend that gets angry like only 2 second but says something hurtful that anyone wants to get and then doesn't know how to apologise.\nI don't want to tell you that meditation will make you a better person because I can't make myself a routine yet, but it has actually saved me from really bad days when I wanted to disappear, making me less anxious and changing the way I saw the problem, not as one I should hate but one I should resolve.\nHope I've helped you.

We don't even know exactly when this happened, since clothes are made of fur, hair, skin and cloth - all things that decay over time and don't usually leave traces for archaeologists to find. However, Anthropologists can make some guesses; I remember that some of the earliest clothes did not, in fact, cover very much at all (they were strings) and so wouldn't have been for modesty or protection, but that's still guesswork on my part.",

It takes about 10-15 minutes to charge the amount that is used for one startup (i.e. break even).\n\n2.  That's hard to say if it hasn't been used for 2 weeks.  I would run it at least 20-25 minutes.  It would be a lot more efficient to use a plug in battery charger if you can get one out to it though.",
            "Modern cars slowly drain the battery, even when they are sitting unused. If your battery is weak, 2 or 3 weeks of slow drain may prevent a re-start. \n\nWhen you park the car for 3 weeks, consider disconnecting the negative battery wire from the battery. This stops any slow - drain, and leaves more power available for the re-start, in 3 weeks.  \n\nAs for your question, yes an alternator will charge the battery when idling, so long as there's no other electrical devices turned on - no  lights, no fan etc. The time required to recharge depends on the components and their condition, - how low the battery is, and how strong the alternator is. Generally, an hour's drive will charge up even the lowest battery up to about 70-90%. With traditional car batteries the lower the charge, the more quickly they charge up. So as they get more and more recharged, they accept less power, if that makes sense. Charging them up to 100% would take many hours, and more a theoretical limit than practical.",

            "Bleach can interact with certain plastics, and it's probably damaging the spray mechanism.  I'm not entirely sure *how* bleach does it, but there's plenty of anecdotal evidence--including yours!--indicating that it does.\n\nNot all bottles are created equal.  Less expensive spray bottles are more likely to be damaged, because they're, well, cheaper and lower quality.  Look for 'chemical-resistant' spray bottles; you can often find these at home improvement stores like Lowe's or Home Depot.  Here's an example from Lowe's: [Zep Chemical Resistant Spray Bottle 32 oz.](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Zep-Chemical-Resistant-Spray-Bottle-32-oz/1000246087)  This is by far the easiest option and would be my first recommendation.\n\nAnother option is to prepare your bleach mixture only when you need it, instead of letting it sit in the spray bottle.  That's a bit tedious, but it's an option.  You'd also have to clean your sprayer every time you use it; the mechanism gets damaged because bleach is allowed to sit inside it, so make sure to clean out the sprayer and flush out its innards before storing it.\n\nYou could also use a lower proportion of bleach.  I used to work in a molecular biology lab; we worked with plenty of bacteria and viruses, and our lab bench disinfectant was only 10% bleach.  It's not necessary to use a huge amount of bleach; what's more important is the time of exposure.  Spraying bleach and then wiping it off immediately is far less effective than letting it sit for 2-3 minutes first."

            "First off, that sounds like a right horrible bunch of shit to deal with.  I'm sorry you have to put up with all those issues and I can totally imagine what you mean when you say it starts to interfere with life.  That sounds frustrating as hell and I really hope you can find out what's going on and get well soon!\n\nTry to set expectations early on.  If you mention a single 'main' issue first, the doctor will naturally focus on that because it sounds like you're coming in with just the one pressing concern, and when you tack on the other issues they'll be less likely to be addressed because 1) the doctor will logically want to address one thing at a time, and 2) they'll sound less pressing because of how you brought them up.\n\nTry this--when the doctor asks you what's wrong, start right off by saying 'There's several things that have been going on for a while that I'm concerned about.'  This tells the doctor right away to expect to address multiple issues, not just one 'main' one.  Then you can go ahead and list them--'I've been having digestive issues, abnormally frequent migraines and nosebleeds, and occasional limb numbness that can last for several minutes at a time'.  Your doctor may still choose one or two issues to focus on simply out of practicality, since he/she can only see you for a limited amount of time before the next patient comes in, but at least they'll be aware of everything and they'll be more inclined to give everything equal importance.\n\nWhen you describe your concerns, make sure to be as detailed as possible.  Your doctor is there for *you*.  Don't feel afraid of wasting their time or awkward about talking for a while--they can't do their job if you don't tell them what's going on!  If you're concerned about your nosebleeds, tell them *why*\\--how often do you have them?  How long do they last for?  How much blood comes out?  If you tell a doctor 'I get nosebleeds every now and then', the doctor is definitely not going to consider it as important as they would if you said 'I get nosebleeds every day, sometimes more than once a day, and they last for up to ten minutes at a time'.  \n\nYou can also ask at some point if your doctor can recommend a specialist for you to see.  If you're going for a normal checkup, I'm assuming the 'doctor' you've been referring to is your GP; you could ask him/her to recommend a gastroenterologist who can check out your digestive issues, or an otolaryngologist who can check out your nosebleeds.  This has its advantages; it allows your GP to focus on other issues (like your migraines), and also means you get more quality care, since a specialist will have a much deeper knowledge of their field than your GP would.",

            "The reason it's considered a bad thing to be adopted is basically because your real parents 'didn't want you\", or \"didn't love you.\" Of course a lot of the time this isn't the case, maybe the parents are struggling financially and don't think that it will be a good environment. But anyways that is why being adopted is considered sad.",

            "The alternative people consider isn't being an orphanage, it's being born to parents who actually wanted to keep them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing adopted is really hard. A lot of adoptive parents and children struggle to form the parent-child bond. It may not come as naturally since the mother doesn't bond through pregnancy and there isn't genetic commonality. Genetic commonality can play a strong role in bonding and it's hard to have that absence. When you feel isolated and disconnected from your family (as many people often do), it's hard not to wonder if that feeling of loneliness wouldn't be there if your \"real\" parents had chosen to keep you, and if it will ever be possible to overcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot of people don't consider family bonds through adoption to be \"real\" family bonds. See: grandparents who only consider biological grandchildren to be their \"real\" grandchildren, and may actually disinherit grandchildren they are not related to. If one sibling is adopted and one is not, the latter may be seen as a more \"legitimate\" part of the family. It helps that they will look more alike and share more mannerisms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd there's the shame and stigma of being unwanted by your biological parents. It's hard not to feel like perhaps it was YOUR fault, like if you were a good enough baby and child they would have kept you, even if that doesn't make logical sense. You also have to wonder about the lives of your parents (if it was a closed adoption). Were they drug addicts? Were they mentally ill? If so, are you destined to become like them? Is there some part of your DNA that will make you like these people, these people who got pregnant unintentionally and then didn't keep the child?",

Land, architecture and temperature outside of scientific use is still on the customary system. Liquids are measured with both systems, and containers may use either. (i.e. bulk soda is sold in either packs of 12 oz. cans or 2 liter bottles.)   \nThere was a huge push to make the switch in the mid 70's with the establishment of a special metric council, and this is what spurred Canada to make the switch. However, there was no completion date set, and efforts died off when funding was cut.   \nOh, and for extra weirdness: the other standard (customary) isn't quite the same as British Imperial.

The increase in weighted blankets being marketed is likely just companies trying to get a larger demographic for their product since they've primarily been specialty products you would purchase online or from a specialty retailer in the past."

Once an engine is at operating temperatures, and under normal load conditions, engine wear is very, very low.\n\nSo, starting up your engine and driving it right then is the best route for engine longivity\n\nAlso, your vehicles computer knows when the engine is cold. When you start it cold, the computer tells the fuel system to run richer (more fuel in the air ratio) and to run a tad bit higher rpm. That's done to warm the engine up quicker, mostly done for emission reasons as a cold engine has very poor emissions",
            "Yes but it's been found driving gentle and low rpms till the car warms up I just as good. The worst thing you can do is start it up amd rev or haul ass. Imagine a cold winter morning and someone comes in while your dead asleep boots you out of bed and has you running full speed in the snow. You're not going to appreciate it.",
            "If you have a turbo, let the oil get to temp before flooring it, but otherwise there isn't a problem.\n\nFunny story: when my dad was young, his neighbor would \"warm up\" his car by letting it idle for ***FOUR HOURS!!!***",
            "The diesel mechanic is correct. The less time over the coarse of it's life that an engine spends running below optimal operating temp the better. Driving modern cars with active, computerized fuel managemen from cold will shorten that time. Letting the car idle during warmup will lengthen that time. \n\nHowever, during cold driving, the internal components have not yet expanded, as metal does when heated. Therefore the tolerances between surfaces are a little looser, and subject to wear when the engine is stressed. So it is imperative that heavy engine loading is avoided during warm up. Avoiding \"bogging\" is just as imperative as avoiding over-revving. I think this aspect is overlooked often when discussing this topic. \n\nBasically, start the car, put it in drive and go while avoiding throttle input of more than say 25-35% until the car is warmed.",

            "He probably has a fair amount of cash in hand... specifically for soft financial assets, you are taxed on any collected revenue but if you revest you aren't taxed until you collect on it. You are not taxed on stake in a company, again, until you cash out but, obviously, the profitability of that company is dependent on growth and they pay corporate taxes (that's all I'll say there). Tax laws are *incredibly* complicated - there are all sorts of scenarios that can be post-tax or pre-tax, there are exceptions and niche rules, etc. Why do you think billionaires donate so much? It's a tax break. Why do you think they settle in certain states? Tax breaks.\n\nIncome inequality deals with mobility and accessibility. The issue is that people like Jeff Bezos have what they do and yet Amazon's getting busted for their poor and useless benefits - he's getting out of taxes by funding his friends' non-profits with money he could have used to support his employees. You can't look at it dollar for dollar because there's cost of living, lifestyle - a million things to take into consideration - and what's important for everyone is their health, their time and their families.\n\nThe issue of income inequality also deals with a hierarchy that's set up for those in power to stay in power and those without to stay beneath us. If you're making a terrible salary, with no education and no time to be with your family or it's compromising your health but you're barely making ends meet and everything's getting more and more expensive - how are you supposed to improve yourself, let alone your kids? Even if you do find a way, how is your kid going to fair with a bunch of kids who've been taught what to do and how to do it while you're on you're own already feeling like you don't belong and at a disadvantage? How are you supposed to succeed when everything is working against you? It's a trap.",

You want to own stock because it pays you dividends (which is income), or because you can sell it at a gain compared to the price you bought it for (that gain is income). So taxing income does not have that much to do with accumulated wealth. \n\nThere are still benefits to being wealthy *per se*, like having a relatively secure income instead of having to perform labor, but I'm not sure you can persuade most people that financial stability is a bad thing that should be disincentivized. On the contrary, policy encourages it by giving all sorts of tax benefits to saving for retirement for example."

        "bestcomment": [
            "It's from a 1992 film titled \"A Few Good Men\".\n\nJack Nicholson's character ordered a \"code red\" operation where some soldiers assaulted another soldier, who had been lax in his duties, trying to scare him so that he would straighten up his act. The victim died, and now Nicholson's character is on trial in a military court. \n\nAt the climax of the movie, Nicholson's character testifies, and ultimately confesses his crime. He explains why, and that's the \"truth\" he didn't think others could handle.\n\nHere's the quote:\n\n>Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lt. Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you could possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know; that Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, *saves lives*. You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall. We use words like honor, code, loyalty. We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it! I would rather you just said \"thank you\" and went on your way, Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a *damn* what you think you are entitled to!\n\nIf you need more context than that, you might want to watch the movie.",
            "NOBODY TELL HIM!!! This movie is worth the watch! Just sit your ass down and watch it!",

        "bestcomment": [
            "You got it backwards: gendered language speakers don't consciously decide what gender a new word is, they start using the word and the word decides itself what gender it is, based on what grammatical properties it lends itself to.\n\n\nGrammatical gender, when it comes down to it, is just categories words fall in to based on how they interact with the grammar of the language. Masculine words take these endings, sound good with these adjective forms, and alter the grammar around them in this way. Feminine words take these endings, sound good with these adjective forms, and alter the grammar around them in *that* way. \n\n\nSo, a spanish speaker takes a word, like \"tomate\", and feels out what is natural. If \"tomate\" sounds off as one gender, it probably will sound better as a different gender. If both are off the word itself will be altered to better fit. All of this happens naturally without thought, similar to how if I tell you \"Vabed\" is an adjective in english: you'd instinctually be able to tell me if it goes \"Vabed, Vabeder, Vabedest\" or \"Vabed, more vabed, most vabed\".",

            "My history is somewhat fuzzy, but it goes something like this:\n\nEgypt at the time was a puppet province of the Roman Empire. Cleopatra and her brother were locked in a civil war of sorts, and she turned to Rome (specifically Julius Caesar) to help solidify her power in Egypt. She won and was put in power. There is talk that she had a child with Caesar and hoped it would bring her more power, but Caesar was killed by Senate.\n\nAfter Caesar's death, the Roman empire stood divided, and had its own share of civil turmoil, but in the end it came down to two factions: the forces of Marc Antony, and the forces of Octavius (who would become Caesar Augustus, the Roman empire's first real emperor).\n\nMarc Antony and Cleopatra had their own relationship, with Marc Antony hoping that his alliance with Egypt could help sway the conflict in his favour.\n\nWhen Octavius' forces took the city, Cleopatra (in theory) killed herself before the Romans could capture her, use her as political leverage, parade her through the streets, what have you.\n\nAgain, it's been a while since I learned about this, but I hope it helps.",

        "bestcomment": [
            "Well this goes back quite a bit before WW2. \n\nJapan until the late 1800\u2019s was pretty much a feudal society with very little industry and very limited contact with outside world. In fact no foreigners were even allowed on the island. Until the 1850\u2019s, the only trade that happened was on a harbor with just the Dutch. The traders weren\u2019t allowed to leave the harbor and step on land. Just allowed on the dock itself. \n\nThis all changed in 1854 when an American admiral, Mathew Perry, showed up in the Tokyo harbor with a fleet of cannon armed ships and forced japan to open to trade \u201cor else.\u201d This was a huge wake up call to the Japanese. They saw how behind they were, and they saw all their fellow Asian nations being colonized at the will of the European powers. They decided it was time to catch up. \n\nJapan then sent people around the world to figure out who was the best at industry, at navies, at armies, etc... and copied it. They began a rapid program to bring Japan into the modern world, including their industry. \n\nThis led to a problem though. Japan, as an island nation, was pretty low on almost every resource. They had little metal. They had no oil. They had no rubber. They didn\u2019t have much, and needed it. This is the #1 reason they began their expansion across the pacific. To gobble up as much natural resources as possible to fuel their growing industry.\n\nBecause of their expansion in China, the United States would go on to place embargoes on Japan. This drastically decreased the oil and other resources flowing to Japan from Asian nations under colonial control. They decided that it was best to act quick, attack the colonial powers at once, seize those resource rich areas. The hope was they could do a big enough blow which would give them enough time to extremely fortify the areas they took, so we couldn\u2019t re take them.",
            "Nothing to do with land, all about that black gold.",
            "The Japanese home islands are relatively poor in natural resources. As part of its process of rapid industrialization in the latter half of the 19th century, Japanese thinkers became convinced that Japan needed to seize direct control of natural resources and strategic bases in the Pacific, to secure its independence. This led Japan to colonizing Taiwan, Korea, several cities in China, Germany's former colonies in the Pacific, and the region of Manchuria, ultimately developing into war with China.\n\nThe United States did not so much want to control the Pacific as to keep it stable and protect the free flow of trade. After all, it made up near half of the world economy and the Pacific market was only becoming more important; protecting the countries went together well with American business opportunity. The Chinese government lobbied heavily in the U.S. for assistance in the war with Japan and got public sympathy; the U.S. secretly supported them. Meanwhile it put trade restrictions on Japan--most seriously, when Japan moved troops into French Indochina, the U.S. began an oil embargo, which was joined by the Dutch East Indies. Japanese planners calculated that their army and navy could operate for only a few months with dwindling oil reserves, so they had two options: negotiate an end to the embargo soon, or else go to war.\n\nOf course, negotiations did not succeed. The Japanese offered to withdraw but wanted guaranteed access to oil in the East Indies, and the U.S. did not want to endorse this. But in a sense Japan achieved its goal: after the war it joined the U.S.-sponsored free trade regime after the war that guarantees it access to essential resources."

The jail was understaffed, overworked, underfunded, and overcrowded. One of the two guards assigned to him was not even a licensed correctional officer. People fucked up, Epstein took advantage of it.\n\nTo believe otherwise, you have to get your sense of reality from the movies, where rich people know how to hire super-secret ninja assassins, capable of slipping into a jail, and then a cell in that jail, murder a guy with zero signs of a struggle or convincing evidence it was not suicide, and then slip back out, leaving not so much as a shadow. This is utter and complete horseshit.\n\nIn addition to *everything else* wrong there, understand that the type of professional, freelance hitman you see in the movies is *entirely fictional,* no such job exists in the real world.\n\nSure, you can cruise seedy bars and find some goon willing to kill somebody for money, and they might have even done it before. But they will not be dressed in an impeccable black suit, nor will they own a leather briefcase with a custom-built knockdown sniper rifle inside. They will be a goon. And they might well botch the job, and when they are caught, they will give you up in a cold second. Or they might just be undercover cops. And they will have no idea how to do all that stuff described above. Hire another inmate of the jail to do the job? Sure.

In Europe all champions play against each other in the champion's league (the strongest leagues can send up to 4 teams) . This is the higest price at European level.\n\nThere's also a world championship for teams that has 2 european, 2 american, asian and african teams, not sure how many of each here.\n\n\nAnd apart from all this there's the world cup for countries, where each nation forms a team with it's best players and plays other countries for the title.

In English we get them mostly from British attitudes toward the French Revolution: either favoring stability, public order and morality, with gradual change when necessary (right/conservative), or radical reform (left/liberal) to try to achieve freedom or equality.\n\nHowever, \"left\" today has a strong association with progressivism and socialism which developed later in the 19th century. These ideas focused on the redistribution of wealth in society. In this sense, \"right\" means \"not left\"; that is, favoring the existing system based on markets and protection of property rights.\n\nLiberals can therefore be either left wing or right wing, depending on the context. Conservatives are generally associated with the right wing in either in either context. However, this issue gets confusing in the United States, where *conservatives* are sometimes associated with protecting the *liberal* American ideals of individual freedom.\n\nMy advice: don't use these terms too often.

The guy vanishes off the face of the planet.\n\nWhat happened is that the guy discovered--probably the hard way--what *every other person* who ever launched an airship eventually discovered: when you put THAT much buoyant surface area into the sky with such wimpy propulsion, you become the weather's bitch. Almost every airship ever launched eventually crashed, usually because of weather. The Hindenburg was a rarity, it died because the Germans were forced to use breathtakingly flammable hydrogen gas instead of non-flammable helium, which the Americans refused to sell them in sufficient quantity.\n\nThe few companies like Goodyear that still operate airships manage it by being obsessively paranoid about the weather. If you have a contract with them to fly you around the Superbowl, but the safety officer doesn't like the look of the clouds, you're not going anywhere, contract be damned (actually, there will be a clause for that).\n\nThe thing is, you can't run a commercial airship service like that, not for things like logging, cargo, or scheduled passenger flights.

I hate it & it just makes me feel worse, but if a family member smells like this I know  to look after them, make them soup & get them to rest.\n\nThere is also a very distinct smell that people get on their breath when they are burning fat from their fat reserve, which can indicate general illness too.\n\nDiabetes has an early warning sign that is a very distinct sweet smell & (this is a bit tmi) that the bathroom smells of that same sweet smell after they've been for a wee. Not something I'd tell a stranger but I have told a family member to get checked because of this. They were borderline diabetic, too early to need treatment but it allowed them to amend their diet.\n\nCancer also has a very specific bad smell. If you've ever smelled it when it is bad I'm sure you can then recognize it when it is not so strong. \n\nThese things, now that I know them, are as obvious as the faint smell of smoke, it just rings alarm bells.\nI think a lot of the time it is just knowing what it means.\n\nIf it was a family member or close friend I'd definitely mention it & ask them to get a check up if I noticed the smell of diabetes or cancer. I'd rather be wrong & have them be cleared by a doctor, than to not say something & it be too late.",

The most common ear clearing method when in a high pressure environment (like descending while scuba diving or landing from a flight) is called the valsalva maneuver. There are tons of YouTube videos on it, as well as many permutations of it since some people need to do slightly different things.  For low pressure (like taking off from a flight or ascending from a dive), I don't know the name but it's essentially a yawn where I flex the tissues in my throat/jaw in the area beneath my tongue.  This is important to clarify because the valsalva INCREASES the pressure in your inner ear to combat the pain from increased pressure externally. If you perform a valsalva when you're supposed to be relieving pressure, you may cause barotrauma.  Plus, it just really hurts lol",

Any bacteria viruses etc. on/in the food will be destroyed in the heat and die (I know viruses aren\u2019t necessarily alive so die is the wrong word but it works for this concept) so they can\u2019t infect you \n\n2. At high heats (usually around 41 Celsius or 106 Fahrenheit) proteins denature, this means they unravel and fall apart, losing their functionality. So anything in the plant/food that might be toxic or poisonous will be neutralized. Obviously this doesn\u2019t work for everything, which is why there\u2019s some things we just don\u2019t eat. \n\nSo in short, cooking can\u2019t possibly make it worse, it can remove some nutrients maybe and make it taste worse sure, but it won\u2019t make something dangerous that wasn\u2019t before (unless, of course, you\u2019re burning it or something)",

            "You don't need the treadmill at all, strictly speaking, you just need to consume less energy (calories) than you use.\n\nIf you're inactive, a more or less average person uses around 2000 kcal just to stay warm and alive. If said person then ate 1750 kcal per day, that would result in weight loss. You can increase your energy usage by getting on that treadmill, though. But it'll also make you hungrier and you'll want to eat more. Basically: weight loss is about diet first and foremost. Working out is a very good idea anyway, but mostly for the other health benefits of it.\n\nHere you can get an idea about your calorie usage: [https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html)",

            "No. You first want to determine what your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is. It is different for everyone. This is how many calories your body burns just being alive, doing normal tasks- breathing, walking, etc.\n\nAny exercise you perform will be additional calories burned ON TOP of your TDEE. Let's say if your TDEE is 1500 calories, and you burn 500 calories on a treadmill- you will have burned 2000 calories total that day.\n\nTo lose weight, you want to run a caloric deficit- that is, you want to eat less calories than you burn in a day. Your body will then be forced to find other energy sources to make up for this discrepancy- and the body will use your fat stores for this.\n\nSo, if you run a caloric deficit of say, 500 calories/day, after 7 days you will have run a deficit of 3500 calories, which corresponds to the energy content of one pound of fat. Hence, you will have lost 1 lb of fat."

The place I lived had a fishing pier, basketball & tennis courts, a pool and a waterfront walkway.   The HOA collected monthly dues from every homeowner, and in return they managed & maintained all those resources.   The HOA also provided us with gardening/landscaping services in the shared areas, snow plowing including walks, stairs, and driveways, as well as providing 24/7 guards on the community gates.   My community was about 1800 townhouses in a big city.   \n\nOther HOAs don't provide as much services, and collect smaller (or no) monthly dues.   \n\nHOAs also enforce rules designed to keep a community clean and keep property values up.   Rules like you have to keep your house in good repair;  you can't paint your house purple if every other house in the neighborhood is white;  you've got to keep your grass trimmed to preserve the appearance and reduce pests; etc.   If you violate a rule, you'll usually get a notice or warning, and then if you fail to fix the problem you'll get a fine.   \n\nThe HOA is an elected board, with all homeowners eligible to vote and run for an office on the board.   They have monthly or periodic meetings, and all homeowners can attend to say what they want. \n\nOnce an HOA is in place, it becomes part of your property deed.   If you want to buy a house in that community, you are agreeing to be part of the HOA.   You don't buy a home in the desert if you don't like sand.   If you don't like what HOAs do, then you are free to buy elsewhere. \n\nThere are some exceptions, but most HOAs are beneficial to the community and do help keep property values up.",

It's only once your body is able to sense that the airway is being blocked by something that you'll start wheezing and coughing forcefully involuntarily. I'm not totally sure why that is the case though. \n\nMy guess is that its related to how coughing is mostly not helpful if you're afraid except if you're choking, and gasping is mostly helpful unless you're choking, and since most things that make us afraid are not related to choking it's probably just a net trade off to gasp a little bit first always"

Meanwhile, while liquids can be quite conductive compared to, like, rubber, they really don't compare to copper.

If we exclude mercury which is dangerous, a 25% NACl solution is about the best liquid at room temperature conductor we know of, and it's still thousands of times less conductive than copper or even aluminum or zinc.\n\nYou could pass signals through such a wire easily enough, but power transfer would be extremely wasteful, so it would be a total ass charging cable."

But of course, odds are always \"1 in\" so it could happen. It's just so very unlikely your head can't contain it.\n\nThe number of ways a deck of cards can be arranged is [beautifully described in this old reddit thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6il1jx/whats_the_coolest_mathematical_fact_you_know_of/dj8nyo4/)\n\n> The number of possible combinations of cards within a deck of 52 cards is 52!

Stand on the Equator and start a timer with 52! seconds on it that counts down each second.\n\n> 2. Every billion years take a step of 1 meter in length along the Equator. You can walk on water for this trick.\n\n> 3. Every time you travel all the way around the Earth, remove 1 drop (0.05 of a mL) from the Pacific Ocean, and keep walking around the Earth.\n\n> 4. When you finally drain the Pacific Ocean dry, place a sheet (0.05 mm thick) on the ground, refill the ocean and repeat steps 2-4.\n\n> 5. When the stack of sheets reaches from the Earth to the sun, take a look at the clock. Of an original 8.06581 x 10^67 seconds, you now have 8.06046 x 10^67 seconds remaining.\n\n> You will have to repeat the Earth walking, drop removing and sheet stacking to the sun process 1,506.25 more times before the clock reaches zero.\n\nedit: Restored the formatting on the quoted section to match the OP.",

            "I recently read that there's an infinite different possible orders in a deck of cards and I'm too lazy to do the math so I believed it. Going by that logic, I'd say the number of shuffles to get that particular order by random arrangement cannot be calculated but let's wait for a smartass to prove me wrong.\n\nEdit: If I remember correctly, what they said was if you shuffle right, you'd likely be holding a unique set that has never been made before."

Simple things like effective use of weapons all the way up to more complex endeavours like fire-and-manuever and CasEvac (casualty evacuation) mean that every soldier in a fireteam has a very solid grasp of 90% of the things they will be called upon to do in a firefight.\n\n2) Morale\n\nMorale is and will always be a contentious subject, but one of the benefits soldiers have over militias is selection and leadership. If you are a liability to a section, you probably are more likely to have been weeded out by the point you encounter fighting than if you're plucked from a locale and handed a rifle.\n\n3) Equipment\n\nThis is something that can't be understated, but if you are being equipped by an organised supply chain you are far more likely to have the requisite materiel to be an effective combatant. Likewise, you are far more likely to know the capabilities of your weapon systems and therefore less likely to take on something that is beyond your equipment.\n\n4) Tactics\n\nMainly an extension of point 1), but having a plan and a goal in a firefight will mean you're far more likely to perform well. Similarly, distributed command structures and specialist roles will allow you to perform far better than a group of generalists who are likely to step on each other's toes and lack in certain areas.",

Others have said it, but it cannot be over-emphasized: **training.** Unlike what you've seen in action movies (and the myths the gun lobby sells), the *normal* reaction of people to being shot at is to scream like a little girl and soil their underwear. So soldiers are trained by rote to get their ass to cover FIRST, then they can start thinking about what to do next. And that \"what next\" covers a lot of ground as well, there are a lot of tactics that differentiate trained soldiers from beered-up \"citizen's militia\" idiots, such as accurately determining where hostile fire is coming from, laying down cover fire as elements of their force move, flanking the enemy, and so on.",

So you end up with a traffic jam at the end.\n\nBoarding groups are done to try and spread people out somewhat, so people in different parts of the plane can be simultaneously putting their luggage up, resulting in faster boarding times. Even letting people randomly board has better aversge results on boarding times.\n\nAnother benefit of the groups is they can charge people extra money who really want to board first.",
            "Price of seats typically most expensive up front to the least expensive seats in back. Due to this they want to ensure the people that paid more for their ticket get priority of overhead bin space.   That and when loading back to front people tend to stick their bags up front (either being afraid theres no room in back, or trying to make exiting the plane faster for themselves.)  This causes people roaming to the back of the plane to find bag space and further clustering up the process.",
            "1st class gets priority, and so peasants can see what they're missing",
            "Group boarding also gives passengers with status/priority better access to stowing carry on luggage. A lot of the time they make announcements asking passengers in group 7 to check their carry ons when the flight is full to keep the line moving when they do start boarding.\n\nIn some airports/countries they may not have jet bridges. In those instances they usually board medium to large commercial planes simultaneously at the front and back based on your seat number.",
            "Generally large aircraft flying internationally try to board from rear to front (first & business class passengers have option to board at any time), but people are like sheep, when one does something the rest follow, so when the airline calls for rows (eg) 50-60 people from all rows think it is time to board & get in line & then block the aisles.\n\nI traveled on one airline that made the announcement, and anyone in other than the rows called, were made to sit off to the side until ALL other passengers had boarded as \"punishment\" for not obeying the announcements. (A developing nations national airline & I don't think a first world country would take the risk of alienating pax). However, it did work & they boarded quicker than ost aircraft I have flown on.\n\nIf people followed instructions, complied with size/number of in cabin bags, there would be room for all bags to put up away quickly & people sat down, then boarding could be done in less than 15 minutes on a wide bodied aircraft.",
            "On a couple European flights we were on. First class and some of the front rows would board at the front. While the zone 3-4 people got on at the rear of the plane. I really liked that was super fast. Kept the people in the back from putting there luggage in the front storage bins as well.",
            "I always thought that people who dont have bags in the overhead compartments should go first. My family and I always bring a small backpack that fits below the seat in front of us and we always have to sit there for a long time after the plane lands while people struggle to get their belongings from the overhead bins. Not to sound entitled, it is just super easy to have a call for those who dont have bags in the bins to leave first, then the people who have bags up there as this takes some time and it\u2019s more crowded :)",

            "DnD stands for Dungeons and Dragons, which is what we call a tabletop role playing game. If you've ever played any videogame RPG, you probably have a sense of some of the basics. \n\nYou create a character, assign it a race, class, and stat distribution, and then name it. Now you and your group go through a campaign with your characters.\n\nThe key distinctions here are that\n\n1) There is no board, no screen, nothing, it's all based on your imagination\n\nAdding some stuff here to clarify. Some people have boards or miniatures or other things like that to help them get into the role. And on top of that, you do need a set of dice of varying sides (d6, d20, etc.) to actually play the game\n\n2) The campaigns are created and moderated by one member of your group, who we call the dungeon master, or DM. The DM's role is to set the campaign up for you, and play the role of the world and the enemies that you face\n\n3) While there are rules that you follow, you effectively get free reign in all your choices, so long as they abide by the rules of the game. This gives you a lot more freedom than in a video game for example, where not every choice is available to you.\n\nHow can you play? See if there's some local groups in your area that are willing to help you out. A local board game store for example often has players.\n\nEdit: added some information"

Thought to themselves that they\u2019d go to college make a ton of new friends and it\u2019d be cool to completely ghost their high school crew. It usually works out for the first couple of years, but then you start to realize how much those old friends meant to you \u2014 how much they knew you and liked you for your true self, among other things. Also, once you graduate college, high school people tend to reconnect as they all head either back home or the closest major city to that. My point is that cutting people completely off is something you\u2019ll likely regret. Don\u2019t assume you won\u2019t have any awkward run-ins or parties with your old crew simply because you\u2019ll be in a different school for the majority of 4 years \u2014 college isn\u2019t the beginning of a new life or anything like that\n\n \nWill all of this apply to you?

        "bestcomment": [
            "A full Moon rises at sunset and sets at sunrise. A new Moon rises at sunrise and sets at sunset. Between those two (approximately two weeks apart), the Moon is visible in the daytime (or at least in the daytime sky) for about two weeks out of ever four. \n\nWhen you can see the Moon in daytime, somebody on the opposite side of the world (which is in night) cannot see it. In 12 hours, when they rotate around to daytime, they can see it.",
            "The moon orbits the Earth approximately every four weeks. Thus from one day to the next, the moon's position relative to the Earth only changes about 13\u00b0 including both day and night. That means, that if you see the moon during the day, you won't see it that night (or just very early or very late at night). And likewise, the opposite side of the planet will only see the moon during similar hours to you.\n\nThe moon has phases that are directly correlated to the moon's position relative to the Earth and the sun. During a new moon, the moon is approximately in the same direction as the sun. It's usually a little above or below it, but you can't see it since all the reflected light shines away from Earth. The exception here is when the path of the moon crosses direction in front of the sun, thus causing a solar eclipse. You won't see the moon at night at all during a new moon.\n\nDuring the crescent phases, the angle from sun to Earth moon is a sharp angle, meaning you can see some of the reflected light, but most is still being reflected away from Earth. During these phases, the moon is mostly in the daytime sky, but it might be difficult to see since the sliver is small and it's against the brightly sunlit sky. During this phase, you may only see the moon at night only soon after sunset or shortly before sunrise depending on if the moon is getting closer to a full moon (aka. waxing) or a new moon (waning).\n\nDuring the half moon phase, the angle from sun to Earth to moon is approximately a 90\u00b0 angle. You'll see this moon during half of the day and half of the night. This is when you'll likely notice the daytime moon as half of it is illuminated and will be high in the sky for a good portion of the day.\n\nDuring the gibbous phase, the angle is now obtuse, the moon is mostly illuminated. It appears mostly at night with just a little time after sunrise or just a little time before sunset being in the daytime sky.\n\nFinally during the full moon, the moon is approximately opposite the side of the sun, meaning it won't appear in the daytime sky at all. Like with the new moon, it's rarely completely opposite, but it does happen on occasion, causing a lunar eclipse.\n\nIn summary, the moon is in the daytime sky half of the time. However, in these phases, most of the reflected sunlight is directed away from Earth, making it hard to notice. The opposite side of the Earth experiences the same phases as you do, so if you see a daytime moon, people on the other side won't see the moon at that moment of night but will see it during their daylight hours as you did.",

It has \u201cChrist\u201d in the name\n\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating that people assume we celebrate and constantly ask why we don\u2019t. It\u2019s not part of our religion. We don\u2019t believe in Jesus. Even if the holiday is now about a fat guy delivering gifts, it\u2019s still a Christian holiday at its roots\n\nAnd it\u2019s everywhere. It\u2019s inescapable. I go into a store: Christmas music, Christmas decorations, Santa\u2019s.\n\nAnd it has absolutely no meaning to me. Even if you aren\u2019t trying to convert, it tells people \u201cYou are different. If you don\u2019t celebrate you don\u2019t belong.\u201d\n\nAnd people think of Chanukah as the Jewish Christmas, which it\u2019s not.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. You don\u2019t need to make Christmas inclusive. Acknowledge other religions exist and don\u2019t try to turn them into versions of Christmas\n\nAmerica is by default Christian, even in secular culture.",

            "Yentas like to complain whenever possible. \n\nSource: growing up with my mother.",
            "So I used to be very bitter about it as a kid and have since grown out of it. \n\nI\u2019ll try and outline my thinking as a kid:\nI went to a public school and was surrounded by reminders that I was different than other people. People made fun of me. I had to explain to everyone over and over again that I didn\u2019t celebrate Christmas. It\u2019s exhausting. I also didn\u2019t get to have my holiday off and I was bitter about it. Maybe these other people just didn\u2019t grow out of that bitterness? I don\u2019t know them well enough to judge. \n\nI\u2019m also not a fan of how a lot of people I know act around the holidays. It\u2019s either excessive niceness that feels fake or aggressively pushing me out of the way in stores.  \n\nAs for Christmas music? I still find it irritating. I\u2019m ok with it the week of Christmas but it\u2019s overplayed and just generally doesn\u2019t sound that good. There are a few songs I like to hear once or twice, but I get tired of it very quickly.\n\nHope this helps!",

When I was a kid, my peers and sometimes my teachers would dish out the antisemitism and because I'm brown, Islamophobia when they found out I don't celebrate Christmas. So Christmas became a time when I got to find out which of my peers thought Jews are an evil force in the world or Muslims are terrorists. I haven't dealt with that in years but seeing Christmas decorations still brings back memories of my teachers failing to intervene when my classmates asked to see my horns.\n\nIt's also fucking everywhere, which really bothers me because being able to celebrate much more serious Jewish holidays (Chanukah is not a big holiday) has always been something I've had problems with. It's a bit of a slap in the face for an entire month to be dedicated for a Christian holiday but I need a fucking note from a rabbi if I want all of two days off from work to observe Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, which are actually serious Jewish holidays.",

            "Perspective: I'm general manager of a small company so I'm involved in reviewing resumes and interviewing potential hires.  So I've got a decent idea of the sort of things potential employees notice and might ask about.\n\nMy advice would be not to say you took it off to travel or even be just as vague as \"personal reasons.\"  That might be kind of a red flag, indicating that you don't (or at least feel like you don't) need a job and could quit on short notice on a whim, which would be an unfair assumption of course.  Bigger companies might not care enough to even ask about it in an interview, but at smaller companies where there's less established procedure and things are more case-by-case, \"get a feel for the person\" in nature, it's likely to come up.\n\nI think a good way to put it is to say something like: \"I can go into more detail if you need me to, but basically I was in a domestic situation where it wasn't feasible for me to hold a job, and now I'm not, and I'm looking forward to my long-term career prospects.\"  It's honest, it shows that you've got nothing to hide but you're also not going to immediately overshare, and it shows that you're looking to the future.  I doubt anyone you'd actually want to work for would press for more unless it's with the intent of showing empathy.\n\nHonestly, a lot of employers might just assume that the resume isn't up-to-date, or that you've been semi-employed while looking for a full-time job but the employment wasn't consistent or relevant enough for you to feel like putting it on your resume.  There's a decent chance you're not going to have to explain it at all.  But either way, best of luck, and much respect for getting yourself out of that bad situation."

            "It's a way to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor. Like an income tax, it's a progressive tax - that is, it hits the rich harder than the poor. This makes it a popular tax overall, except when you're the one paying it.",
            "I'm not a big fan of inheritance taxes, we don't have them here in Canada, and I think it's a good thing.  It's money that has already been earned, it should be able to be distributed as seen fit.",
            "I suppose nothing *needs* to be taxed, so long as the government gets its money somewhere. Inheritance behaves as income, so it makes sense that it would be taxed accordingly.",
            "There is a general belief that especially large inheritances are effectively \"gifts\" or bonuses and so taxing them at a higher rate (and thus allowing taxes on income and sales to be lower) is a reasonable way to generate income. People also advocate for estate taxes as a way to make it harder for wealthy people to guarantee that their kids are wealthy and concentrate wealth by class rather than it coming from how much value a person adds to society. \n\nIf course your mileage may vary, but those are the usual arguments.",
            "That\u2019s like asking why any form of tax exists. To fund the government.",
            "If it's like the US, the tax is paid BY the estate, not by the inheritor.  \n\nThe US also has gift taxes where you have to report any gifts GIVEN over $15k and have to pay gift taxes once you reach a lifetime maximum gift limit of $11mil.  Again, the person receiving the gift pays nothing, the person trying to redistribute their money has to pay the taxes.",
            "Nothing needs to be taxed. All tax is a balance of \n\n\"how do we get the money we need to pay for the stuff we want\" and to a somewhat lesser extent \"how do we use tax to express the values of a society.\"\n\nThese two come into play.\n\nWith inheritance tax the justifications are:\n\n1) you are dead. Far better to pay the tax when you don't need it than when you do.\n\n2) the people getting the money didn't earn it. Inheritance is a gift that is by definition someone else's money. It is a generally difficult to defend stance to say \"i am being hurt because I'm getting a smaller unearned gift than i should be.\"\n\n3) if you are a person who stands to get a sizeable inheritance, it is likely that you have already had a number of privledges already as a result of that money. You have likely grown up with a better education, more connection, less debt, better health, etc spent on you by the wealthy person already. And there has likely been a sizeable amount of wealth already passed on to you as gifts, down payments, vehicles, etc etc throughout your life. Which again makes the \"and now I'm getting a smaller cash gift than i would have other wise\" somewhat uncompelling to many people.\n\nIt also makes it one of the most progressive taxes out there. In most countries there is a sizeable exemption (in the US the first 5 million dollars you leave is tax free, or 10 million for a married couple, meaning that you have to have substantially well off before it even impacts you (and again, the person being taxed is dead).\n\n4) It is a well known bug/feature of capitalism that wealth tends to accumulate at the top (i.e. the \"takes money to make money\" mantra). And there are relatively few mechanisms to counteract that. The wealth tax is one of the few. That is appealing for some.\n\n\nThere are some notable exceptions to different aspects of this. The one people love to bring up is working farms. Namely, farms cover a lot of ground, but don't make enormous amounts of money. So someone who dies and leaves a farm to their kids is leaving something of substantial value (if sold) but not necessarily the cash assets to pay the dollar value of the land. This can, if not accounted for, force heirs to sell off part of the land in order to pay the taxes.\n\nAgain, the inheritors are getting something of substantial value, so this isn't necessarily different (if inherited 40 porsches and had to sell 20 of them to pay the taxes nobody would feel too bad for me). But there is something deeply romantic about a family farm and the land your family has worked for generations (and that isn't sarcastic. It is something that has genuine pull).\n\nSo that is usually the story that people pull out to fight against inheritance tax, even though that is the minoritybof cases. It is also a case that could be easily carved out an exception. \n\nBut real estate is also an avenue that many wealthy people use as tax avoidance/dodge in inheritance (see New York Times article Oct 2, 2018).  So those who want the inheritance tax gone largely don't want the exceptions to be too specific that it can get the family farm but avoid the hotel chain.",

If you volunteer to present when you don\u2019t have to (not necessarily first, but before it\u2019s forced on you) it feels like you\u2019re more in control of the situation. You\u2019re actively choosing to do it, and therefore it\u2019s less scary.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t magically flip a switch, but it does help a little bit, and it helps more if you get into a consistent habit of doing it.",

            "From someone who hated public speaking growing up and who is now comfortable with it, here are a few tips I can give you:\n\n1. You're going to be anxious if you don't *know* the source material and are simply reciting memorized points. Get to know your source material, you should know it like the back of your hand. Then, you're simply just talking candidly about something you're passionate or knowledgeable about- and that is easy.\n\n2. The 'Spotlight Effect.' People tend to believe they are being noticed more than they really are. In reality, everyone is too busy thinking that everyone is focused on them- and they're not focused on you. Remember that. No one really cares how well you're doing on your presentation, because they're all too busy being nervous about presenting their own. Any minor fumbles or hiccups in your presentation will probably not even be noticed, or will be almost immediately forgotten about.\n\n3. If you're shaky (I was), try to be animated. Don't hold anything in your hands. Talk with your hands and move your body around as you speak. If you're using a piece of paper, set it down somewhere where you can still read it as you present. I find this really helps- it much better than standing frozen in place as you speak and helps the audience be more engaged with your topic.\n\n4. Practice. The more you do public speaking, the more comfortable you will be going forward as it'll just be another day in the office. As nervous as you might be, don't turn down opportunities to public speak. Being good at public speaking is one of the most valuable skills you can have going forward in life. Keep at it, and you'll get better.",

K-POP is highly crafted from the ground up to target a specific audience, solely for the purpose of making money, sorta like Mcdonalds.  Many, many, many other artists, famous and non, follow a much more organic path, crafting their own lyrics and style and message, like a fancy French restaurant.  Often times, when someone considers themselves a serious music fan, finding genius and originality far supersedes the enjoyment from listening to music designed by producers and marketers.",

These voltages are enhanced and adjusted inside the speaker device until they make it to the speaker, where the sound vibrations are made by the speaker's interpretation of the adjusted voltage signal.\n\nIt buzzes when you touch it because we are surrounded by 50 or 60 Hz AC electrical power, which creates a measurable electromagnetic field that changes all the time. Our bodies have quite a lot of capacitance, or ability to store charge. This also causes our bodies to be able to catch some of this electromagnetic field. When we touch the end of an AUX cable, the voltages that are induced inside our bodies due to those trapped charges can be sent over the wires to the amplifier for interpretation.\n\n50 or 60 Hz electrical power is not the only thing that causes electromagnetic fields, it was just a reasonable example that was relatable.",

The \"Well, he isn't going to win\" rhetoric is so strong in this country at the moment. Even the very legitimate anti-Semitism concerns within the Labour party have not, until recently, been brought to the Conservative Party, to see if they have a reliable report system. A party that has had high-ranking politicians (including the current PM and party leader) making Islamophobic, sexist, classist remarks in public. The media focus has stuck fast on the Labour party despite this.\n\nThe modern democratic process is a propaganda war, and the Conservatives have been more willing to abuse social media to generate distrust and apathy among possible Labour voters.

Doesn't mean the other people are staring at the couple/group doing intercouse, they just do their own thing like sleeping, nursing, also having sex, eating, etc.\nAs a note, this was the case in many European and other societies too, in times when several people used to live in building with one room. \n\nPrivacy in sex is often tied to religion and culture as well. Some societies considered sex to be a private thing. Some religions practice(d) ritual public sex, but that was more performative in order to achieve something (like blessing from their gods) than \"i am horny, let's have sex on the street\".",

Early guns fired massive hunks of lead with little precision. These would demolish what they hit, but be imprecise and slow to use. Modern firearms squeeze accuracy and damage out of much smaller payloads. While a .22 lr may not be the ideal round for stopping a human, .223 NATO seems to work absolutely fine for the U.S. military. These bullets are accurate to great range, and can be fired in quick succession while maintaining accuracy quite well. In world war 2, we were in the process of wrapping up this transition. We went from muzzles and breach loaders to bolts in ww1, and from bolts to automatics in ww2. From there, we improved our automatics to carry a lot of ammo, have optimized power to recoil, and be convenient to carry and use.\n\nEdit: To add, the purpose of guns is not to kill people. The purpose of guns is to get people to stop shooting back. People often can't just take a bullet and keep going. You don't need to blow their arm off to get them to sit down and cry for hours."

            ">I feel like they haven't advanced at all for the past twenty years other than wifi connectivity. \n\nNot true. They've been advancing every year, but the advancements have been mostly to fix small errors or decrease cost. If you're looking for leaps and bounds, ask yourself how much more is needed to get ink on a piece of paper and you'll see the issue with your expectations. \n\nHowever, some people argue that this, the internet, is a giant printer as text and images are endlessly replicated around the world seconds after a pages loads.\n\n>They're huge and take up too much space. \n\nNot true. There's lots of different kinds to fit your needs. Buy a smaller one. \n\n>Unreliable\n\nThey're not. Git gud. Take a few moments to learn how they work and advance your IT skills in a world where IT skills will be an expected skill. Learn, don't expect.\n\n>Long startup that rivals AOL dial up\n\nThey take about 1-3 minutes on average to start up and around 1 minute to wake up from sleep mode. Calm down. Learn how to change the power settings.\n\n>Ink sometimes costs as much as the printer itself.\n\nVERY legitimate claim. The printer industry figured out that it could make more money on ink and toner than printers, so they jacked up the price in the last decade. It sucks, but it's the world we live in.\n\n>They refuse to print when the deadline is in 15 minutes.\n\nAgain, learn. Don't expect.\n\n>Where are the \"futuristic\" printers that just WORK?\n\nThey're called 'laser printers' and they use lasers to print. Welcome to the future.",

            "I would assume less and less people are printing things, so printing technology isn't worth investing in. That's just a guess, though.",
            "Modern printers aren't nearly as shitty as 90's and early 2000's printers.\n\nBut that said who really needs to print stuff these days? The only time I've ever printed something personally outside of work was forms, usually government forms or something that I have to sign and scan, and half the time I just paste a pre-scanned signature onto an image of the form and just send that instead."

If you get loud ringing or white noise at frequent, seemingly random intervals, you should go see an Otolaryngologist to rule out an infection, then you should see an Audiologist because you may be about to loose your hearing in that ear. If neither of them find anything conclusive, the last possibility is a tumor pushing on the auditory nerves, but that is by far the least likely cause.",

            "You need to wait for everything to settle out.   You won't have a payment date until after your billing cycle closes.\n\nWe seem to get this question a lot.  You have *up to 60 days* from the date of purchases before any interest accrues, depending on where in the billing cycle the purchase was made.\n\nOnce your billing statement is generated, you only need to pay the \"last statement balance\" (not the minimum payment, but the last statement balance).  You generally have around 30 days to pay it.   So this means purchases near the beginning of your billing cycle can be almost 60 days old before you are required to pay for them.\n\nIf you do not pay your last statement balance before the due date, even 1 cent short, then interest will accrue immediately on new purchases.  But as long as you are in a state where your last statement balance was paid in full before the due date, you do not need to make further payments until the next statement comes out.\n\nEdit: BTW cashback is only usually calculated when your statement closes.  Anyway long story short, you just need to wait for your statement and billing cycle to close.",
            "Also it's worth noting there's no particular benefit in paying it off right away after the purchase. As long as it's paid before the due date (once you figure out what that is) it won't result in any interest or hit to your credit score."

They would be unintentionally supporting something bad. The current format works okay for creators to reply to their viewers, and I think YouTube is leaving that as the intended use of the comment section."
