      "My friend used to work for a company that has always promised out IT department a trip to Hawaii for working through a couple of rough years without pay raise and on the flip side we won't get any personnel cut. It was a verbal promise that once we are back to profitable, the IT department would get all expense paid trip. Back around October of 2015, they were gathered in the largest meeting room for a meeting with the president. There were snacks, drinks, pizza, etc. It was assumed that it was a celebration for a good year and they'd get the promised trip. It was a mass layoff since IT has been outsourced. All credentials were locked during the meeting and everyone was asked to leave the premise right after the meeting.",
      "When I was a kid, there were about 6/8 families in our area who were a good group of friends. Regular holidays together, kids all close friends too and in the same classes at school etc.\n\nThe backstory was that one of the families kept noticing money going missing from a drawer in the master bedroom. They had an older son who was getting the blame but was denying it. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and it\u2019s their younger kid\u2019s birthday, and everyone is at their house. Usual script was the kids party would be late afternoon, then in the evening the kids would end up playing games in some bedroom as the adults had a few drinks. Kids were happy because we got to stay up late with all our friends, parents got to have a few guilt free drinks. This night was going as normal until we\u2019re all shuffled out and home earlier than usual. We got the full story the next day.\n\nOnce the kids were out of the way, the owners of the house had turned on their tv and pressed play on a video. On screen there was cctv of the bedroom where the money had been going missing. Clearly in the video you could see the wife of one of the other couples, sitting in that very room, going into the drawer and taking money. Apparently the switched off the video, said \u201cwhat you saw is exactly what it looked like\u201d and asked that couple to leave. Everyone else left shortly after.",

I was going to be moving a lot with my mom and didn't want to loose them.\n\nAbout 6 months later, my father dated a woman that was absolutely bat shit nut case. She got drunk while my father was working and burned down his house.

Worse yet, there were some older students set up at a table, selling some kind of raffle ticket. The universe did not want me to get my breakfast, as the queue for these tickets was long enough to block my entire path.\n\nBut I was not to be deterred. Amprovise, adapt, overcome, they say. I noticed that there was a small gap between the girl in charge of the table, and the wall behind her. In my hunger-addled, chubby little Scottish 12 year old mind, this was an invitation, an open gate through which I could pass and enter the realms of breakfast Valhalla. \n\nAs I approached, however, the girl leaned forward over the desk, and her leg raises up behind her, effectively blocking my path. In my greatest \"fuck you, universe!\" moment to date, I believed, with complete confidence, that I could make it through the gap by simply jumping over her leg. \n\nOh, how wrong I was. As I leapt, believing in my heart that I could soar through the air like a majestic eagle, my foot caught her leg. I felt a sharp change in my trajectory as I now began my rapid ascent towards the cold hard ground.\n\nAnd yet, I was so close to victory. I could smell the tantalising air from the cafeteria, and I gained a surge of confidence. The jump may not have worked, but there was nothing stopping me from recovering this blunder, moments from disaster. I simply needed to reach out, catch myself on the floor, and use my momentum to roll! From the roll, it would be a matter of standing up, recovering my balance, and making my way to the halls of deliciousness while my peers applauded.\n\nMy left arm was on-board with this new approach. My right arm did not get the memo. So when I struck the ground, my left arm took the full weight of my body, and the bones therein cleanly snapped halfway between my wrist and my elbow. \n\nThe rest of my body came crashing down, and I hit the ground hard, sliding a good five feet from my landing site on the polished ground.\n\nI never did end up getting my breakfast. But I did get my first, and only, broken bones. In the ambulance, I was able to see that my hand had turned almost all the way around to face me, and the doctor said it was perhaps the cleanest break he had ever seen.",

Some situations just suck, and pretending otherwise isn't \"happiness\" so much as it is \"delusion.\"\n\nAt the same time, though, a tragedy in the past doesn't need to have a negative impact on the present... and since the present is all that we have, it's wisest to take actions *now* that will lead to the best future. That can sometimes seem difficult, of course, but if you adopt the attitude that you're responsible for yourself \u2013 regardless of any unfair hands that you might have been dealt \u2013 and if you assume that there's always a path onward and upward, you'll probably discover that happiness comes on its own.\n\nRather than saying \"I'm unhappy because of X,\" it's better to say \"X would make me happy,\" then work toward it.\n\nIf you don't know what would make you happy, start looking... or just start working until you discover it.\n\n**TL;DR: Happy people have something to strive toward.**",

      "We were best mates. For years. Lots of sexual jokes, lots of \"couple\" activities, weekend trips, cinema - whatever we did, we did together. None of our friends would have been surprised if we had suddenly announced that we were planning to marry, we were just really really close. Some of my boyfriends were jealous, some of his girlfriends were jealous, but we didn't tolerate that.   \nIf you can't trust me enough that I can have a best male mate, then maybe our relationship is not built on solid grounds.\n\nFast forward a couple of years, both of us were single, a drunken night. Perhaps one of the most wonderful experiences ever, because we knew each other so well and trusted each other, and it was just good. For a brief moment, it was perfect and we talked about a future, drunkely, giddily, happily. But I broke it off immediately. I didn't see that we would be compatible as partners for a long time, while I knew I couldn't lose him as a life-long friend. We have lots of common interests and shared values, but vastly different personalities (I'm the crazy, driven one - he's the steady, relaxed one - and we each like that side in each other). We both commit to people, and we would have driven each other crazy.\n\nIt was a bit awkward for some time. And both of us had romantic interest and something like a crush and it hurt. Oh god it hurt so much because it had been so perfect. But we got past that. Half a year later, he found another girl, and she was so similar to me that I couldn't not notice, but I liked her. She was much more calm than me, and could give him what I am still not ready to commit to; and he's so happy. And then a year later, I met a guy who could challenge me and cope with my crazy career and push me and still be a home, and I fell hard.\n\nWe're still best mates. We still write every day. We still do couples' activities and see each other every week, but now it's sometimes four of us and not two. Looking back, it was the right choice. It couldn't have worked.   \nStill, sometimes, there are moments, tender gentle moments, where I know both of us think of that night and what could have been. For all that matters, he's my best friend. For all that matters, he's the one that got away.",

While we got it right with drugs, Portugal almost completely ditched jails entirely, we turned courts into a money making machine for the state, where people have to keep paying more and more to the courts and their incredibly over-the-top bureaucracies over cases that last **INSANELY** long amounts of time.\n\nIn Portugal no one goes to jail.

      "Made me think of this. \n\nNighttime. Sitting on the side of the road running radar. Not much going on. Dicking around on my phone waiting to see if anyone speeds by. Look in my mirror and see a car coming up behind me. Appears to be a newer mercedes SUV. Both headlights are working. Clock it 5 under the speed limit. Go back to my phone. \n\nIt finally passes me and I hear a horrible screeching noise as well as lots of clunking. I look around for a few seconds trying to figure it out where it came from and if I'm hearing things. That Mercedes was the only car in sight. It was dark where I'm sitting so I didn't get a detailed look at the car. I knew it was a newer mercedes because it had those crazy looking front LED lights. \n\nI pull out and drive up behind it and I can see the car bouncing up and down a little and can make out some rear end damage. Ok, maybe they got rear ended recently but are driving the car until it gets fixed. But the bouncing worries me so I put the lights on and we pull over. \n\nI approached the driver and it was the sweetest old lady you've ever seen. Looks your grandmother on her way to church on Sunday. I was expecting her to hand me a cookie. I asked her if everything was ok with her and her car and she said absolutely. Nothing could be wrong. \n\nFinally I take a step back, put my flashlight on the car and take in what I'm looking at. This car is destroyed. Absolutely totaled. Tires blown out, rims bent, bodywork shredded and missing, and grass and jutting out of every orifice. All the passenger windows were blown out. The drivers side mirror got ripped off and thrown into the associated window and was now inside the vehicle hanging on by an electrical cable. Broken glass everywhere. No airbag deployment oddly enough. It looked like she rolled the thing over in the woods and then kept driving right after. I couldn't believe she drove it as far as she said she did. \n\nShe said everything was fine. Had EMS come and check her out. She was fine as far as I and they could tell. Mentally she didn't skip a beat. Knew the date, where she was, etc. She definitely drove it when it crashed because there was broken glass everywhere in the car and on her, except on the seat where she was sitting. Meanwhile i had another unit checking the route she said she used to come to my town and they couldn't find anything that showed an accident happened. Went all the way to her house and didn't find a thing. \n\nAll in all I didn't really know what to do. If there was an accident I didn't know where and what jurisdiction it was in. No one else called 911 to report anything. She said everything was fine. I ended up having a tow come and take her car to a repair shop. I couldn't force the lady to go to the hospital, and she really didn't feel like going but I asked her nicely, like a kid asks their grandma for a sweet. Ma'am, I know you say your fine but it would make me feel a whole lot better if you got checked out. She smiled at me and got on the stretcher. With her old lady gloves and everything. \n\nEverytime I see that model of mercedes suv I always wonder how she messed that car up so bad.",

You need to convince every single person on the planet to collectively get their shit together, and you need to do it ASAP. How you gonna pull that one off, champ?\n\nOzymandias' solution: you cannot convince every single person on the planet to collectively get their shit together through conventional means. But, if done properly, you can *trick* every single person on the planet to collectively get their shit together. In order to work, though, this trick had to be rock solid and air tight. Everyone had to fall for it. If even just a single person caught on, it wouldn't work. It would have to be something extreme, something drastic. \n\nAnd when you're talking about saving the entirety of human civilization, is anything too drastic? Come to think of it, is it truly possible to fool every single living person with the same trick? Or at the very least, is it easier than actually getting humanity to work collectively of its own volition? \n\nWhat I love most about Ozymandias is the questions he raises. I'm pretty sure we can all agree that being racist towards mutants is bad, no one is going to disagree with Magneto there. But whether or not it's worth it/necessary even to try and trick humanity into doing good rather than trying to explicitly convince it, that's a deep philosophical debate that does not have a clear answer.\n\nOzymandias was not right. He wasn't wrong either. He's not a hero, and he's not a villain, he's just a man, trying desperately to do what he can with what he's been given. He's not sure of himself, but he's sure that someone has to do something, and so he will.\n\nFinally at the end of it all, when all the cards are on the table, things don't end with a climactic battle, they end in a debate over philosophy and human nature between a naturally gifted intellectual powerhouse, a middle aged slightly overweight schlub with erectile dysfunction, a woman who is quite literally in the middle of having a crisis centering on her traumatic childhood/upbringing and deep seated parental issues, a mentally unhinged man that probably doesn't bathe regularly, and what is basically for all intents and purposes an actual god. And they all have their own views to bring to the table, and while some are ultimately given more pushback than others by characters in the story, just as far as the writing goes and how it's presented to the reader, all their conflicting ideologies are treated with the same respect and presented as being equally valid.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***TL;DR*** His point was that it'll be easier to trick humanity into getting along than actually convincing people to just be nice to each other, and I like that because it's not just a clear \"yes, you are correct\" or \"no, you are wrong\" it's more of a \"well... I mean..... I guess....... Fuck, alright, I'm going to need an eighth of the strongest sativa you got, 3 tabs of lsd, at least 2 grams of shrooms, 350 mg of mescaline, and a weekend in the desert, and then I'ma get back to ya\"\n\nEdit: I made the TL;DR bold",

My method of searching (on Yahoo!) for the term \"naked ladies\" might not have been the *best* way to scour for smut, but it still offered some decent results.

      "Lying to children about Santa Claus.\n\nIts interesting that several studies have concluded that there is almost nothing more detrimental to a childs relationship with their parents than breaches of trust. In a loving parent-child relationship, the child is almost always traumatized in some way when they learn that their parents lied to them. It's not so much that \"Santa doesn't exist\" but instead that \"My parents deliberately lied to me.\" \n\nDr. Paul Ekman, who wrote 'Why Kids Lie - How Parents Can Encourage Truthfulness', stated that the loss of trust is difficult to repair; sometimes it is never reparable. Dr. Judith Boss agreed, saying that it isn't engaging their imaginations, but it's just a lie.\n\nIn the book 'Traits of a Healthy Family', author Delores Curran interviewed over 500 familes. And within the top 5, was a sense of trust. She explained that trust is essential, and breaking it, can easily cause annimosity for years to come. \n\nThe New York Times did an article on this subject and they said that all to often, the focus is placed so much on the receiving of gifts, that for young children, that is what the holiday is about. It teaches kids to be selfish. Similarly if kids do try to be good purely for the presents in december, it also creates a greedy attitude of 'If Im good, I get a reward' rather than being a nice person for the sake of itself. One Professor said that by the age of 3 a childs basic moral sense is firmly set, with the rest quickly following in the next few years. This makes early childhood, which is the time parents are actively lying to their kids, crucial to not be doing so. \n\nThe point is that the evidence strongly suggests that Santa is one of the most damaging things to a young childs mind. He cultivates a greedy selfish attitude and ultimately he turns the childs sense of family and trust into shreds. One Pediatrictian, who was interviewed about Curran's book, agreed and said that it's safer to just avoid the Holiday altogether.",

I however decided that my pocket knife wasn't going to be intimidating enough... so i started carrying my butterfly knife. which is illegal. i just figured i'd flash that, flip it around a few times and the dumb shits would run off. derp.\n\nso one day i'm a lunch with my friends when a rent-a-pig walks into the cafeteria and says \"i just busted 2 boys in the bathroom smoking! i'm gonna check the rest of the table for lighters and cigarettes!\"\n\nso he takes us into the bathroom one by one and has us empty our pockets. guess what he finds? you guessed it. not just a knife, but an illegal knife.\n\nso I'm automatically expelled for having a knife in school. naturally my grandmother had  a shitload of chores for me the next day as punishment for getting expelled. one of which was to walk down to the piggly wiggly and get a bunch of groceries.\n\nso i'm walking across the parking lot when i hear the sound someone running up behind me in the pea gravel. it was like my spidey sense went off: i knew it was actually going down. those wannabe gang bangers are actually jumping me. like for real.\n\nso i spun around with a perfectly placed back fist, dude hit the ground. I kept swinging, another dude on the ground, then another, and another, etc. seriously, i think back on that moment and dont know how the hell i managed to pull that shit off.\n\ni had 5 dudes on the ground when i heard someone yell \"CRAZY ASS WHITE BOY!!!\" and i started laughing. and that was it. i lost focus, next thing i know they're beating the shit out of me.\n\nso i kept laughing. it was the only thing i could do.\n\nwhen the cops showed up they were grinding my face into the pea gravel of the parking lot, me laughing maniacally, and they all scattered.\n\nlong story short, I had an expulsion hearing the next day. I figured that I'd be able to explain everything, show my fucked up face as proof, and hopefully they would be understanding and let me go back to school.\n\nthen i fucked up again. my friends were having a party that night, so i snuck out to go tell them what was going on. as i was leaving i stepped on this dudes new nikes and... well... he attacked me. with the chain from his wallet. from behind. i blacked out. when i came to i had the chain wrapped around my fist and 3 cops holding me down, all my friends standing around me saying \"you went too far man\", and i dont remember a fucking thing. apparently i took the chain away from him and beat the fuck out of him with it. \n\nso fast forward: in court i was charged with 6 counts of assault (yes, they jumped me, pressed charges on me for assault because i hit them first) and posession of an illegal weapon in school.\n\ni didn't deny shit. i didn't claim self defense. i stood up in the court and basically said \"you're goddamn right.\"\n\nso i ended up in juvie for 6 months.\n\nhow did it impact my life?\n\nAfter juvie i had to live on my psychotic dogmatic fundamentalist believing christian grandparents farm while i was on probation. my grandfather pretty much beat me every day for a year. broke a PVC pipe over my head. eventually pulled a gun on me and threatened to blow my head off.\n\nafter my probation was up i went to live with my mom who promptly had a drug overdose, ended up in a psych ward which left me homeless.\n\nthe experiences i had with my family impacted my life way more than the time i spent in juvie... but none of it would have happened if i hadn't gone to juvie. still, i wanted nothing to do with these psychos, and i didn't want to go down the same path my mother did (heroin). i had to get out.\n\nso i did. i busted my ass. got my ged, put myself through college, graduated with honors, moved to CA and made a career for myself. bought a house. just got married.\n\nand none of THAT would have happened if i hadn't gone to juvie.\n\nso there ya go. thats my story. well... a small part of it anyway.",

My pitch is usually, \"Worst case you go out, we have fun and you've done something new. Best case it becomes an interesting and funny way to describe how you met someone new.\"\n\nThere's a place where you can learn axe throwing near me. That's top of my list right now.",
      "Before we can discuss the best options for a first date, we need to establish the kind of relationship that's ultimately meant to arise from it.\n\nIf someone is only looking for a **casual fling** of some variety, then a good first date is one that takes place at a coffee shop or a quiet restaurant. Conversation should include mutual interests, preferences for entertainment, and other such lighthearted topics. The idea isn't to gauge long-term compatibility so much as it is to see if hanging out with the other person would be fun... and to ensure that they don't have any plans to wear their prospective partner's gallbladder as a hat.\n\nIf someone is looking for a **long-term relationship**, then that same coffee shop can serve as a decent venue. The topics being discussed should be significantly more substantial, though, including details like political perspectives, religious ideologies, and personal approaches to society as a whole. Sustainable comfort in each others' company is much more important here, meaning that physical, emotional, and mental compatibility should be the foremost foci, along with any plans to wear a prospective partner's gallbladder as a hat.\n\nIf someone is looking for their **last-ever long-term relationship**, then they've probably discussed all of the aforementioned topics already (either via a dating application or in the context of pre-dating friendship). As such, the best venue for a first date would be a very brief stop at the coffee shop (just to confirm that the other person is who they claim to be) followed by an immediate trip to the bedroom. This will allow the prospective partners to explore sexual compatibility, which is just as important as the physical, mental, and emotional varieties.\n\nIf someone is looking for a **one-night stand**, then the wisest location for a first date is anywhere that a person can ask \"Are you planning to wear my gallbladder as a hat?\"\n\n**TL:DR: The nature of a first date depends on the nature of the intended relationship.**",

Once we can have a virtual display overlay going in a simple and effortless package, it's going to take over everything. \n\nYour computer?  Good-bye old displays.  Why pay extra for a monitor, or two monitors, when you can confure forth as many as you need via AR?  Not to mention they can be any resolution or in any orientation you demand.  Your desktop could literally be your desktop.  Keep a short roster of important applications right on your desktop.  They'll have little 3D icons and I'm sure they'll be animated, and irritating.   Maybe you'll keep your folders and files in literal drawers in your desk.\n\nWhen you're out and about, AR will help, too.  Imagine Waze in an AR format.  Rather than having to look away from the road, a simple overlay will do the trick.  Follow the line!  Attention-getting icons looming in the distance will warn you of traffic and speed traps.  Your kids' school might have a notice in front of the building letting passers-by know that next thursday is a teachers' conference, and school that day is cancelled.  The local library predominately displays their operating hours along with a token bookmark you can take that'll refer you to their website later when you're not in the midst of travelling.  \n\nThe commercial districts is where things will be *really* nuts.   Remember the hologram shark from Back to the Future?  Turns out that was gonna be an AR thing all along.   Operating hours, product placements, animated displays, dinner menus, and so on.  I imagine it'll get to the point where some kind of filtering system will necessarily need to be built-in.  Remove audio, product placements, and so on.  Virtual tour-groups will follow AR celebrities as they walk between points of interest.  New construction may have finished building overlays that'll show off what it will look like when completed, and hide the detritus of construction.  Other overlays will show you social service areas, crime levels, and wait times for the bus.  \n\nAll the information you want, overlaid on the real world, in real time.",

      "Because economic systems are built on GDP growth - when the economy grows we all do better.  Stock markets go up and we compound interest to make exponentially more money.  This has worked throughout capitalism because global populations have risen.  More people need more homes and infrastructure and this creates more jobs and these extra people buy more things.  This only works if the population keeps growing - its a kind of human pyramid scheme.  This is what we are going to have to deal with now.

      "As a kid, I had a frequent dream about mutant, beefed-up Gorillas. The tops of their heads were see-through so you could see their huge, pulsating brains. They were horrifically violent, ripping people apart. They would start to gather outside my house and I knew I had to escape to survive. I was home alone, so it was all down to me. As they started climbing the walls and smashing through the glass, I would race to the garage. I would find the keys to the sit-on lawnmower and start it up, just in time. A huge gorilla would smash through the door and I would drive out on the lawnmower. It never ended well. Strange thing is, we didn't even own a sit-on lawnmower."

      "My father used to tell me that I had an excellent \"reading vocabulary.\"\n\nThat was his way of saying, \"Max, you mispronounce things a lot.\"\n\nMispronounced words in my repertoire (ree-per-TOY-ray) included:\n\nObelisk (OBE-lisk)    \nChagrin (CHAIR-in)    \nGolem (Gah-LEEM)    \nMyth (Meeth)    \nBlithe (Bleeth)    \n\n... and a whole host of others that I can't be bothered to remember right now.\n\nStill, even those mistakes were nothing compared to my younger brother's best mispronunciation.\n\nMy family used to go skiing every other weekend when I was younger, and quite frequently, the only entertainment we'd have while staying at our condo was a stack of *Fox Trot* comic collections. Although I wasn't an especially avid fan of the strip (though I did feel a certain sympathy for Jason), the books were still more entertaining than staring at the wall for hours on end. Anyway, after spending an evening reading the comics in question, my brother learned a new expression... and he decided to use it as a commentary on our dinner that night. The moment we all sat down, he stared at his plate and yelled:\n\n\"*Bleach!*\"\n\nEveryone turned to look at him. \"What?\" my father asked.\n\n\"Bleach!\" repeated my brother. \"Bleach!\"\n\n\"Clorox,\" I answered. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"No, not *bleach*,\" my brother said. \"*Bleach!* Like they say in *Fox Trot*.\"\n\nAfter a moment of silence, something seemed to occur to my father. \"Do you mean '*blech?*'\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh. Yes.\" My brother eyed his plate again. \"Blech!\"\n\nEveryone at the table laughed about that, after which my father told my brother that he was being rude, and to shut up and eat his dinner.\n\n**TL;DR: \"*****Bleach!*****\"**",

      "The survival of Koalas. You wanna know why? Because Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.",

He pulled it away and showed that it was a playground slide.  That was my present from him that year.\nI remember that he was wearing a blue and white striped shirt and that he and I stayed out there for a long time as he helped me up the ladder and caught me at the bottom of the slide.  Over and over again.\n\n\nAnd that's it.   I have no other memory of him.  He shot himself 2 months later.  \n\nGoddamn am I glad I have that memory.  I hope it never fades.",

Some folks have suggested that the recollection may have been manufactured (or at the very least, influenced) by having seen the recording in the intervening years, but I remain steadfastly certain that my perspective is genuine. \n\nEither way, there exists \u2013 somewhere in a forgotten box of family memorabilia \u2013 a home movie of Abby and me taking a bath. We're both about two years old, and she's showing me how to capture bubbles with a cup and release them at the bottom of the tub.\n\nA keen observer will notice that I am staring a bit too intently at the area between Abby's legs.\n\nSeveral seconds pass, during which time Abby performs the cup-and-bubble trick for me again. Eventually, though, it becomes clear that I cannot contain my curiosity.\n\n\"Abby,\" I can be heard to ask, \"where is your penis?\"\n\nWithout hesitating for even a moment, Abby responds: \"In a drawer in the bedroom.\"\n\nThere may have been more to the exchange, but laughter from the adults behind the camera drowns it out.\n\n**TL;DR: I was disturbed by the sight (or lack thereof) of an allegedly misplaced penis.**"

Hell, if I wanted that, I would just pay an escort, because money is no longer an issue.    \nWhen I had my old job still which required a 45 minute drive via train, I made myself the promise to get to know someone from the train every single drive.

The choice of which strategy to employ is governed almost entirely by how long a given meal takes to prepare... which means \u2013 as I discovered one day \u2013 that there's a tiny window of time wherein I'll try to do both at once.\n\nI don't recall what I was making on the evening in question, but I can tell you how everything played out: There were a couple of pots and pans on the stove, a stack of plates next to the sink, and several forks and knives on top of those plates. As I started washing everything, I got into a rhythm of grabbing a plate, scrubbing it off, and then depositing it in the dishwasher, all in a weird kind of choreographed dance. Then, as I was about two thirds of the way through the process, my stove's timer went off, indicating that one of my pots needed to be taken off the heat.\n\nWithout even thinking about it, I grabbed that pot, put it beneath the running water, and started scrubbing.\n\nThe worst part of the whole situation \u2013 other than the fact that I had completely ruined my dinner, that is \u2013 was the slow-motion way in which it seemed to play out. Some internal part of me could see what was happening, and it even tried to raise the alarm, but by the time that my limbs started responding to conscious commands again, I was left with a soup of hot water and soap suds.\n\nI don't know this for sure, but I'd be willing to bet that I ordered a pizza that night.\n\nAlso, I probably ate it straight out of the box.\n\n**TL:DR: I accidentally washed my dinner while attempting to do the dishes.**",

My wife is still mad that it did before we met, but she doesn't completely understand why.\n\nA high sex drive turns into a very bad sex addiction, and it's exhausting. Even if you're really fit, you will still have so much sex you'll be sore everywhere, including your dick. I would have so much sex my dick was red and sore, completely swollen too. My body would be hurting and I would still keep going. If you can't stop yourself, you'll collapse from exhaustion. Even if you feel like throwing up, you'll keep going. No matter how uncomfortable I'd get, I'd never wanna stop. I'd have sex for hours and hours, and I'd be completely dry, but I'd still want more. It's disgusting and really unhealthy to be that sexually active.\n\nThere's also the emotional impact of it all. You live for hook ups even when you acknowledge that they only give you affection because of the \"good sex\" you offer back. It really tears you up, you'll tell yourself you don't want a relationship or love, but you do.

There was another girl there who was coming on to me and before I knew it, she and I were making out and she was fingering me. She taught me how to eat a girl out.

I turned around to see him freaking out because my hymen had broken/released when I stood up on the ground and I was dripping where I walked and leaving a trail.

Well since I'm a normally calm person I didn't care about the fact there was a group of women with crying babies. Mind you this they were all talking lettimg their babies just sit and cry. I walked around thinking nothing of it til I see one of the moms smack the babies head telling he/her to shut up. Thats when I lost it, I walked over there and said \"Hey! What the hell why did you just do that\" and she had the audacity to respond with \"The stupid thing wouldn't shut up.\" So me and her starting arguing over whether she should've hit the baby. I know its not my kid but she shouldn't of done that, and it wasn't no light pat it was a smack but not like knocking out the baby. Believe me it looked like it hurt. She had her friend's follow me around the store after I called the cops and was heading out the doors. So I waited for the cops and told them what happened. This bitch really told the cops \"He slapped my baby!\" So I jumped in and told them to look at the cameras. They indeed saw that she slapped her baby and then arrested her. I dont know what happened after that but I hope her baby is in a better home.",

      "I've never proper lost my shit, but one time, probably the only time I done did lose my shit, was when a friend, my closest and only friend, said, \"No one would love you enough to get you something without begging.\" I now only a few people I give my trust to, and they are on discord, so, yeah. Mind you I knew that person for 5 years, and had been through hell and back for whatever reason."

      "\"Holy shit, he's taking Roy off the grid! This guy doesn't have a Social Security number for Roy!\"\n\nNo but for real, I'd be pretty afraid of changing anything. Everything happens for a reason and I don't want my history undone in this existence. Keeping one's memories would be hell because you'd inevitably change your life and those memories would be of a false existence, or at least one which you can no longer take part in. \n\nI guess if I had to, I'd try to be more emotionally conscious of myself in my teens. I'd adjust my goals on grade school and hesitate before spending money on that year of college. I'd focus on making friends with all the connections I missed or didn't fully appreciate and, for the most part, skip the people that ended up  harming me. Knowing that my parents divorce ended up as a good thing (I love my father but could never fully respect him or want him with my mother ever again) and that I have the opportunity to mentally prepare myself for it, I would try and skip the full brunt of the emotional trauma and tried to run damage control for Mom. I would try to steer Dad away from his toxic 2nd wife, too. One big moment in my life so far was moving across the country as a child. I wonder what would have happened had we not, but I worry what would have happened to some individuals had we not moved (my mother's boyfriend suffers from severe PTSD and I wonder what the potential lack of companionship would have done to him and how any alternate events would impact his daughter). Despite this, I'd like to do a playthrough where the move doesn't occur, to see what opportunities I missed and could take advantage of - the downside to that being it makes all my other personal knowledge useless. It'd be an entirely different life. That'd be strange and exciting and scary. The setup would be the same but the life would be totally different, and without those memories of the past life, I would be totally different. \n\nUltimately the mechanics of the concept scare me. It sounds like a hell for me, but if I found myself in such an unfortunate and mind-bending spot, I would have no choice but to change a few things.",

Driving away the one I loved with my whole life.\n\nThere is much more that I would have changed but then... if I did all that I would most likely never have met some amazing people that I know. Never experienced that kind of love with my ex which made me blossom into a more open person.\n\nBy changing these things, everything might get worse so who knows. I might just change a different ice cream flavour that I disliked once instead.\n\nHave a good day/night~",

I still will be flawed, since I won't remember everything there is to know about this life I'm in right now. However, I'd just be a nicer person and try and play my relationships with various people differently.

    "bestcomment": [
      "Felt numb at first and didn\u2019t really grasp it. I thought, \u201cI look okay, what\u2019s up with that?\u201d  Ten months of chemo and I\u2019m in remission, so I was relieved. I was never one of those people who said, I\u2019m gonna lick this thing.  I knew how serious it was. Just grateful I\u2019m in remission. \n\nAny time I feel tired or get twinges of discomfort I do have it in the back of my head that maybe it\u2019s back. \n\nI have chronic myelogenous leukemia",
      "Diagnosis: Terrifying but also reassuring. I had a fast-moving cancer, which scared me. But I also had a professional verify my concerns and initiate a plan of action to fix it.\n\nThe surgery was a huge relief. The monthly tests for two years afterward made me a little nervous, but the results were all negative.",
      "It was shocking because my at my appointment prior to the diagnosis my doctor suspected it was just a cyst and I mentally didn't prepare myself to hear the word cancer. You hear about cancer your whole life on TV, in the news and of others who've died or who are battling, but you never expect that one day it would be you to hear the words from your doctor. \n\nThe stress of waiting for my surgery was almost worse than the diagnosis. I waited about 3.5 months for surgery and it was brutal because you're constantly wondering what is going on inside your body, is it spreading? how aggressive is it? man. The doctors and nurses however were amazing and the moment I was told I was cancer free it was a major relief. In fact it was only last week I was given the good news and I am truly grateful. Best of luck to all of you who are reading this and are battling the beast. Keep on fighting I'm rooting for you!",
      "My cancer was luckily caught early, so I was never worried about dying from it but there was the possibility of needing to get the afflicted organ, my uterus, removed. When I got the diagnosis I was mostly stressed about telling my mother, because I didn\u2019t want to talk to her about how I planned on (not) using my fertility.\n\nAfter a small surgery to remove some polyps, most of my treatment consisted of taking medication which reduced the cancer cells left gradually, and so receiving a negative biopsy wasn\u2019t particularly momentous, although I\u2019m very glad to not have to take those pills or get such frequent pelvic exams any longer. The more meaningful good news for me was after my first MRI which showed that the cancer was not *growing* and that meant that I wouldn\u2019t need to get a hysterectomy. Everything after that was just a waiting game.",
      "I had leukemia between 2-4. Throughout school every year my parents would take me to hospital for a checkup but I never understood why. \n\nMy dad told me when I was 12. I was shocked and couldn't think. I had to clear my head and go for a bike ride to my friends place and pretty much broke down in tears. I can't really remember any more than that.",
      "Not me but my wife was diagnosed with with Colon Cancer.  We didn't know what to expect.  A teacher at a local school had just lost her battle with the same diagnosis.  My daughters could think of nothing else. My wife has been cancer free since 2015.",
      "Good question. In a way I was prepared for the diagnosis as the doctors had told me during the surgery the cyst looked suspicious and being a somewhat unlucky soul I expected the worst.  I spent 2 weeks waiting for the results to be confirmed. In that time I went to a dark place but finally accepted that at 23 I had cancer after many tears.  When the biopsy was confirmed I recieved the phone call and felt calm and collected.  They told me I needed chemo and another surgery. I felt actually excited to begin the journey because I just wanted to be able to put everything behind me and hopefully be able to get on with life if everything worked out ok. That might be weird to some people. Was also scared out of my mind. \n\nTo be told you are NED (no evidence of disease) after such a roller coaster and at some points accepting your own death possibly....well. I can't describe that initial feeling.  Its like when there is a storm and the first ray of sunlight shines through.  You feel like crying and jumping for joy at the same time and getting drunk. Its a rush of adrenalin and I felt like I wanted to accomplish everything on my bucket list right then and there. I kissed my partner, rang all my family and friends. Its a second chance at life and was a true miracle (in my case). Spoiler: those feelings didn't last but every day I am thank ful for my life.",
      "I was very numb when I heard.  It didn't feel real.  I'd wake up every morning and have those few seconds of forgetfulness, which felt like such a relief until my mind figured out \"hang on, relief from WHAT?\" and then the anxiety hit me like a tidal wave. \n\nThe waiting for the surgery was the worst.  It felt like everyone was happy to wait when time was supposed to be of the essence.  It was somewhat like they weren't taking it seriously because it wasn't their life on the line, etc. \n\nI was driving to an amusement park when the doctor called to report the surgery had been a complete success.  It's a relatively minor form of cancer and, thanks to my wife, it was caught very early.  Even when the prognosis is excellent, it still terrifies you to hear the word \"cancer\"."

During the day, between tasks (or during), I will look at random objects and think about how I would draw those on paper. I will also get paranoid about something I said to someone and proceed to do yoga or draw to quiet my mind. Eventually, I always start thinking about the \u2018big questions\u2019. Yesterday, I thought about the Fermi paradox, and then thought about how consciousness would present itself if we were indeed in a video game (i.e. individual objects would not have consciousness, consciousness emerges from the whole structure, as part of the games language/logic)."

I was in a bad place at the time, and there was no way for me to see her or be by her side. So I self harmed a lot, and took a few too many pain pills the next day. \nWhen I got sick from them I was panicked and didn't know who to ask for help. Contacted the wrong person, he ended up telling my mother (even though I told him not to because she was dealing with enough) and she cut me out of all their lives for over a year after cussing me out and making accusations that I was attention seeking and trying to make my sister's accident about me instead. I was close to suicide but my dad (who found me about a year before that incedent) talked me down. \nBy the time I got over it (ie, accepted she was probably out of my life for good) and had gotten to know my dad more she tried randomly coming back into my life. Never apologised. Called what she did \"setting boundaries.\" \nI didn't want to talk to her at all after that. Later found out about how she had physically assaulted my dad many times, never took care of me at all as a baby, and probably didn't treat my siblings much better than that. The few times I visited, she didn't spend much time with any of us.\nI wanted her to care so much, but she's genuinely a narcissist who never thinks she's in the wrong. The only thing that makes it a bit better is that my stepmom (I consider her my real mom) showed me what love was supposed to be like, so now I don't feel like I need the old bag for anything.

He was insulting me all during gym and at one point I broke and punched the hardest thing I could've in the gym,which was the bleachers instead of fucking him up like I should've. Even my other classmates were saying I should've hit him instead but I didn't. Later that day my wrist and hand was hurting like hell so I went to the nurse and she put ice on it. Once the dean heard what happened in gym he talked to me about controlling my anger and not letting it control me and he had a talk with the bully.  It was hurting a few days later and my mom took me to the doctor and I found out my injuries to my hand. I had to get a cast and after at least two months and a half of trying to write with my left hand the cast was taken off. The aftermath of my hand healing was my pinkie permanently being less defined but that was it. The up side to this was that I got to mis out on one test and didn't have to do it after and I didn't have to do gym. Thanks for reading a bit about my life."

I went through training to get more skills and confidence with travel and home management, and the accessibility of most modern tech has exploded. Most of the time, my inability to do something is caused by someone else refusing to follow basic accessibility laws. I travel on my own regularly, and if I don't know the area and don't want to ask a stranger for help, I can use a paid video chat service that employs trained professionals who can describe what they see through my camera. I live alone, constantly tinker with the latest technology, read regularly, spent too much time on text-based subs here, cook when I can be bothered, have been to college and had online and offline jobs, and am in a happy committed relationship with someone I met on an online text-based game. There's an entire community of us out there, and some people are less independent or open about their experiences, but many are happy to answer questions.\n\nHow do I deal with it? I act like the relatively normal person I am, and most of the time, it works. I don't hide it or refuse to talk about it; I just don't make it the subject of every sentence.

She helps me control my pain meds, tells me that I'm a good person even though I may be cranky, grouchy and what I would call a complete asshole. She just loves me unconditionally and reminds that there are good days mixed with the bad and to please hang in there.  \nAlso try to find a good Pain Management Doctor especially with all of the new drug laws being passed, not because honest genuine injured people are overdosing BUT because people like to mix a whole cocktail of uppers and downers. \n\nSo good luck to you and all of you good people whom are truly in chronic pain.

      "Society is suffering from entertainment overload. We consume it faster than it can be created and we're only starting to notice the side effects now. \n\nIt's interesting to note that Ancient Rome suffered the same malaise, as it's citizens demanded ever more taboo entertainment as they tired of the traditional fare. \n\nNow we're seeing that play out again in modern times. Our societies are increasingly turning to the taboo for stimulation, as it is the only thing left that does. \n\nWe've turned our politics into spectacle showcases, more concerned with being entertained than governed. Trump is the result, not the cause. Expect more of the same, as we will never return to the days of stodgy policy wonks with squeaky clean records boring us to tears. \n\nDating, and mating have been turned completely upside down, with flirting morphing into instant sexual gratification (send nudes) instead of the old world courting process. We now pick mates like we pick items off a shelf. We've nearly completely lost the ability to be 'in the moment' with regards to meeting people, as we feel this inner need to vet them online first. We want to know as much about the other person **before** we even engage with them. \n\nLabeling for quick judging has taken over, with people readily fitting into boxes for us to ignore or join in with. Debate has all but vanished as a result. Compromise is a thing of the past, these days you are either in my box or you're an enemy, no middle ground.\n\nSocial media hasn't connected us, it's isolated us. \n\n[Google isn't making us smarter, it's making us dumber](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/) as we no longer retain the knowledge, it's just another search away afterall...\n\nWe weren't ready as a species for this level of information. Society is historically slow to adapt to changes and we won't really know the side effects for a few more decades. \n\nOverall, I think it's a positive thing for our species, but the interim period is full of problems and the transition to a more enlightened approach will be rocky to say the least."

I asked her a question but she wouldn't answer and i could hear her whimpering (I was looking in her direction when i asked her this) and she asked me if I could see the eyes as well, up to this point I was confused until i looked forward to the other side of my pitch black closet and there were two glowing red eyes staring at us, like no shit TWO glowing red eyes.

I was sitting on the bed watching a football game on the TV (muted) and following Reddit's game thread on my laptop. I was wide awake, fully clothed with the dog sitting next to me. House was nearly silent.\n\nSuddenly from the kitchen I hear a deep booming voice speak a full clear enunciated sentence in a language I don't recognize at all. It was fluid with no breaks between words like a chant, but hard and unpleasant. Maybe 12 to 15 syllables total. \n\nThe dog loses it's little doggy mind, fur standing up, and barking\\yapping. \n\nI looked all around the house, checked toys, electronics, smoke alarms and couldn't figure it out.

There is no shame in medically managing the symptoms of an illness and sometimes doing that helps you to take the positive, productive actions necessary for a better life, like tidying and cleaning. Also, try to break tasks down into small steps rather than getting overwhelmed by the enormity of the situation. On days when I couldn\u2019t get off the sofa I would sort things from the sofa. The key is to just start somewhere instead of putting it off because you don\u2019t know where to start. Achieving small actions and seeing results improves your confidence to build up to the bigger challenges. Focus on progress not perfection. And don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help if there are supportive people in your life who could assist you, sometimes people want to help and are just wondering how so they will be relieved if you reach out. Access all the resources available to you to achieve a better quality of life. You deserve it."

Also theres the argument that the bottom dollar is most important and everything else is just unnecesary money spent on developers, so they get the cheapest ones they can get and still end up with a \"good\" final product, which is most likely why independent developers like to hide more easter eggs and nods to things like cheat codes, because they can decide whatever they want to go into the game, to go into the game.

I\u2019ve had nights where I barely sleep because all I can think of is humiliating things I\u2019ve done, better choices I could have made, and how I\u2019ve effected the people around me",
      "Shame absolutely affected my development as a kid. In third grade, during art class, I challenged a kid to a fight at recess, because he'd blabbed to the everyone that I liked a girl. Obviously that was a stupid thing to do. For some reason I thought that's simply what had to be done in that situation, even though I felt no real malice towards the kid, and I'd never actually fought anyone.\n\nThe art teacher was a young, headstrong woman in her first year of teaching. She decided an example had to be made of me. Queue dragging me to the front of the class, and painting me not only as a bully, but as the reason that public school becomes a terrible experience for other kids. I had already been crying by the time she had finished dragging me, and she ignored all of my blubbering apologies.\n\nWho knows, maybe she did good work and kept me from becoming some major douche-canoe. After that encounter, though, I was a ghost through high school. A teacher wouldn't get two words out of me unless they said it was okay to speak.",
      "It's a regularish little flame that now doesn't last more than a couple of days (usually in hypomanic crashes, because 1) while depressed I don't do anything so the only thing it's possible to be ashamed about is not doing things due to a medical issue, which isn't something that bothers me and 2) when fully hypomanic I'm not sure it's possible for me to feel shame).\n\nThe last stages of hypomania are usually the point where it seems really sensible to  go out and party extremely hard, possibly because something in my head recognises the \"fun\" times are coming to an end. Turns out dodgy brain chemistry plus intoxicants is a good way to do something mildly horrifying.\n\nHowever, as with anything, repetition makes shame easier to move past and frankly slightly boring. It would take something dramatically awful for me to have prolonged feelings of shame now."

I forgot all the things I needed and ended up walking out with a bunch of snacks and then remembered I was also supposed to work that day in like two hours, plus I had to train another hire that night.\nSafe to say I was the chillest trainer that night and wasn\u2019t even mad when the kid fucked up",

My wife noticed immediately and got pissed about me doing this right before an important event. Luckily it was in an outdoor bar with bad lighting. Got seated with her family of course, who are all kind of straight, and I was paranoid as hell because it looked like I had just spent the day in an over chlorinated pool. They of course were asking me the normal questions (about work, how we liked where we lived etc.) I just kept going to the bar and smashing vodka redbulls secretly to get my energy up and loosen me.

Eventually I became a board member for them.\n\nHowever, at 17 I was a huggggee stoner. I\u2019m talking multiple times a day, consistently high stoner. \n\nI was asked to speak at the steps of the state capitol for a Pride event one day.  About five minutes before we got there, my friend and I smoked a huge blunt. I was high as fuck. \n\nWe had to walk past anti-gay protestors to get to the podium, but by the time it was time for me to speak all nerves I had about being in front of a huge crowd had disappeared. According to everyone that saw me, I did really well! It was engaging, serious, and uplifting. Do I remember what I said? Not really. Would I have prepared better now? Probably.
