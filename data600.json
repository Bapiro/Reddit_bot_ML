            "I think I was about 10 when this happened. My grandparents used to have this zip line that went from a tree out over the river that bordered their property. Lots of fun, we spent many a day the summer it went up zip lining out and dropping into the river. \n\nOne day a bunch of family and friends were there, and we were all using the zip line. Then my dad took a turn, but the handle snapped when he left the platform and he crashed down onto the rocks on the riverbank. I can\u2019t remember for sure, but it was probably around a 10 meter fall. My brother and I had just taken turns before him so we\u2019d been coming out of the water as it happened.\n\nHe was passed out facedown in the water, and it took a few seconds for it to register for everyone. A few of my uncles ran down to pull him up onto the shore, and then he started having seizures, was swallowing his tongue, just really scary shit. Like I said, I was 10 so I don\u2019t fully remember everything that happened, and I was taken over to the other side of the yard with my siblings so we couldn\u2019t see how rough he looked. \n\nMy aunt called an ambulance and they came pretty quick, and it ended up only being an overnight at the hospital, and he just had a concussion, broken sinus, and a bunch of scrapes/bruises. \n\nScariest moment of my life without a doubt, I thought he was dead (and he very well could have been). Thankfully, he\u2019s still with us!",
            "This is more unsettling than scary, but it had me shook up for a bit. \n\nWas at a restaurant with my fianc\u00e9, we were the only ones eating there (it\u2019s one of our frequent spots). Two guys came in, one dressed like a construction worker and the other dressed somewhat nice. They asked for take out menus and just sat there by the front door.\n\nWe walked out to go to the grocery store which was in the same strip of buildings, but about 100 yards away. The nicely dressed man got up and walked out behind us, as he said something in a foreign language to his friend. We hopped in the car to park closer to the store. When we got out, we noticed he was standing in front of the store just awkwardly looking around. As I walked by, I could hear and see him talking into an earpiece in a low voice, still in a foreign language. I told my fianc\u00e9 about this and we took our time in the store. I told her to wait inside while I grabbed the car, but she decided to come as she didn\u2019t want to be alone. \n\nWhen we walked out, the guy was gone. But as we got in my car I noticed a vehicle with both doors open two spots behind me. Both of those men were sitting in there trying not to make eye contact. We looked in the rear view and the man in a construction outfit was motion with his head towards our car. We drove behind the car and noticed it was an out of state tag, took a picture and called the police station to let them know what had happened. \n\nWe\u2019re two of the most calm people we know, but I\u2019ve never felt more \u201coff\u201d about something in my life. Way too many circumstantial things going on to not have something up. Why follow us out, why wait outside the store, why drive your car across the parking lot to sit behind mine? It doesn\u2019t help we live in a city that\u2019s one of the nations highest in sex trafficking. It may not be the scariest story, but I\u2019ve never been that freaked out in my life, and I\u2019ve been through some wild things.",

            "I was robbed at gunpoint in college. We had heard about a bunch of robberies that were happening around campus where the victims would get the shit beaten out of them. There were 2 guys and 3 of us, but one of the guys had a gun. They walked up to us and immediately pointed the gun at me, hit me with it in the chin and chest, and then pushed us up onto someone\u2019s front porch. While they were taking our wallets and phones, with the gun still pointed at me the whole time, the guys who lived at the house (who\u2019s front porch we were on) opened the door. So at that point there were 7 of us being robbed. The robbers took whatever we had and then walked away.\n\nI thought the gun was fake the entire time, so it wasn\u2019t as scary as you\u2019d think. But when we all rushed inside the house after they left, we saw the robbers walk back up to the porch and then shoot through the (glass) door. I was so close to the shots that I could taste gunpowder and feel the dust from the glass on my face. I bolted through this random rowhouse for the back door and tried to hide under the back deck stairs, but was completely exposed and couldn\u2019t go anywhere. I could only hear everyone running inside the house and I was convinced they were coming in to shoot us. The robbers ran off instead.\n\nTL;DR I got robbed and shot at",
            "I was hiking in the mountains with my friend, in an area where there are black bears. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a large black animal running towards and slightly behind us up the side of the hill.  \n\n\u201cBEAR!!\u201d I shouted to my friend and we both started running for our lives. I didn\u2019t even know I could run that fast. Obviously you can\u2019t outrun a bear, so I thought we were about to die. \n\nAfter a terrifying minute, for some reason my friend looked behind us. And started laughing. As a huge, black, shaggy dog ran up.\n\n\u201cSorry, he\u2019s friendly!\u201d called the owners from a further down the trail. I couldn\u2019t answer them, because I was gasping for breath, crying with relief, and laughing hysterically all at the same time.",
            "This is going to sound like a joke, but it genuinely terrified me.\n\nHe-Man used to be one of my favorite heroes. There was even a time, back when I was in kindergarten, that I insisted on wearing my suspenders in an X shape (in an effort to emulate Prince Adam's style). \n\nThat all changed one fateful evening, though. \n\nI had been gifted a battery-operated replica of He-Man's sword, which sported several buttons that would play various sounds and cause the blade to light up. There was also a feature that made the weapon clang and flash whenever it was smacked against something, which was good for seconds upon seconds of fun... at least until my mother shouted at me to stop whacking the furniture. \n\nThe sword also had a rather nightmare-inducing feature, which I discovered firsthand: In order to turn it off, you'd have to put the blade through a powering-down sequence. However, if the batteries were already running low, it could actually get *stuck* during that process, which would leave it emitting a pale, ominous glow, and a deep, creaky growl. This \u2013 combined with the fact that the sword would attempt to power down automatically after a few minutes of inactivity \u2013 meant the toy was a perfect device for scaring children who were trying to go to sleep. \n\nHere's what happened: I'd been playing with my He-Man sword one evening, when my mother finally got fed up with my antics and sent me to bed. Upon arriving in my room, I put the weapon in one corner of my bedroom, turned off the light, and crawled beneath my covers. That's when I heard it: A low, evil moan drifted through the night, accompanied by a sickly yellow light. I jumped upright in bed and stared, wide-eyed, at the source of the disturbance. The sword flickered in the darkness, its mocking snarl like a promise of impending doom.\n\nI bolted from my room, screaming for my parents. My father (who had only just arrived at home) took it upon himself to first reassure me, then remove the batteries from the haunted toy. You can imagine the horror I felt when the sword kept glowing and growling for a few moments longer, even after the source of its power had been cut off. \n\nAfter that night, I didn't like He-Man much anymore. \n\n**TL;DR: In the dark, there was...** ***a HE-MAN SWORD!***",
            "When I was 8 my family went on the Disney Cruise. The weight limit at the time for someone going down the water slide called the Aquaduct was something like 75 pounds. I was like 78. So I went and not even a quarter through I get stuck because I didn't weigh enough (I didn't know this at the time). The water stopped flowing and I was stuck a good hundred feet in the air over the cruise ship in the middle of the ocean. So I turn around to see a security camera on the slide and start screaming crying for them to get me down.

We cuddled her back to sleep. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe time after a huge fight, my mom came downstairs and was shaking. I went to comfort her but she was startled and scared of me. She tried to hide from me and was upset. She didn't seem like she was herself or could recognize who I was.

Here is a good example of a proper anti-joke:\n\nA cowboy walks into a livery stable and asks for a horse. \"I need a horse, but I'm short on cash. What can I get for $25?\" the cowboy asks the owner.\n\n\"Well, for $15 I can give you 'ol Bill. He's seen a few years but he's still a fast horse\" replies the owner.\n\n\"Why so cheap then?\"\n\n\"Well, he ain't so good at listening. You see, he gets his Whoas and Giddy-ups mixed-up.\"\n\n\"You're kidding? Well, I don't have much choice. Here's $15, friend.\"\n\nAfter he'd payed for the horse the owner went out to the stable to get Bill. When he came back, the cowboy could see that Bill was indeed old, but had very strong legs. After preparing the saddle, the cowboy hopped on Bill.\n\n\"Alright, Bill. Giddy-up!\"\n\nBill would not move, not a twitch from his ears.\n\n\"C'mon Bill! Giddy-up!\" he clicked, kicking the horse with his spurs.\n\nBill wouldn't budge. Not a swish from his tail. Remembering what the owner had said, the cowboy adjusted his reins and called...\n\n\"Whoa, Bill!\"\n\nBill's ears perked, and he flew out of the barn like a bat out of hell. Horse and rider were outside the town in seconds, with a huge dust cloud trailing behind them. Off they went, flying over the Arizona hills. The cowboy could barely hold on to his reins; his feet flailing out behind the stirrups.\n\nOver the next hill the cowboy could see that Bill was running them straight towards the edge of the Grand Canyon. He pulled back on the reins.\n\n\"Whoa, Bill! Whoa!\" he cried.\n\nBill kept running. The edge of the precipice coming closer.\n\n\"Whoa, Bill! Stop, damn it!\"\n\nHe suddenly recalled what the owner had said about Bill's mixed-up directions. Taking a deep breath the cowboy closed his eyes and shouted \"Giddy-up, Bill!\"\n\nBill came to an abruptly fast stop, just one horse-step away from certain death. The cowboy nearly vaulted over Bill into the vast gorge. Bill panted with exhaustion while the cowboy wiped his brow with his kerchief. From atop Bill, he looked down into the canyon at the dry riverbed far below.\n\n\"Whoa, Bill. That was close\"\n\nFortunately, Bill was a horse and knew better than to run off a cliff, and so the cowboy's ill-considered use of the word woah in this context had no negative repercussions.",

Buy him a drink and maybe he'll tell it to you.\"  \n\n\nSo the man walks over and introduces himself and offers to buy a round. The guy with the big orange head says, \"Yeah, I'll bet you want to know the story, huh?\" To which the man replies, \"Sure, if you don't mind.\"  \n\n\nThe man with the big orange head sighs and says, \"You know, I've gone over it in my mind a million times. Basically, it's like this: I was walking along the beach one day, when I stubbed my toe on something. I looked down, and there was an antique brass lamp. I picked it up and dusted it off a little -- when all of a sudden this enormous genie pops out!  \n\n\n\"The genie thundered, 'You have released me from my ten-thousand year imprisonment, and I am in your debt.

And the ocean parts, and out walks this gorgeous woman in this beautiful dress, and she takes my hand and we fall in love and the genie marries us right there. It was incredible.  \n\n\n\"The genie booms, 'You have one wish remaining.'\"  \n\n\nThe man with the big orange head pauses and sips his beer.

            "An extremely rich man has a son. On the son's sixteenth birthday the father planned an extravaganza hiring  rare and expensive wonders. Thousands of guest where to attend. To make  his son's birthday perfect he asked his son what he wanted to make his  birthday the best ever willing to buy the anything in the world. The son  thought about this for along time and eventually told the father. \"I  want one Pink Ping Pong ball.\"\n\nThe  father was confused but he agreed. The day of the party was a event to  remember the Blue Angels painted the sky and Indian mini elephants  brought in a gilded chocolate cake. After the concert with too many high  profile stars to name it was time to open the presents. Along with the  slew of high end clothing and private islands there was a small box for  the boys father. Inside was a Pink Ping Pong ball.\n\nThe  young man was ecstatic thanked his father profusely and scampered up to  his room. He was in there about two hours before he came out and the  Father never saw the Pink Ping Pong ball again.\n\nA  year passed and the Father was ready to throw his son another birthday  party. Again he wanted this to be the best party the world and his son  had where seen. I mean 17 is an important age. So the father pulled out  all the stop. And to make sure the party was perfect the father again  asked his son about what he wanted as a present. And the son thought  about it for a few minutes and said he wanted a whole crate of Pink Ping  Pong balls. Now the father was confused and asked if the son if he was  sure. The son thought for a couple more minutes and nodded. The day of  the party the father had hired hundred's of A list celebrities to attend  the party. He reconstructed the backyard of his mansion estate to  accommodate a gilded marble statue of his son. The first truly sentient  robot brought a cake made of edable diamonds. And every person in  attendance got a gold plated iPhone 9 in their gift bags, complete with  hologram features. Now it was time for the presents admist a real alein  pet and a autographed copy of every president's portrait. Their was a  large box from the boys father he opened it and inside was a large crate  full of Pink Ping Pong balls. The son was ecstatic thank his father and  rushed to his bedroom. The father never saw the crate or any of the  Pink Ping Pong balls again.\n\nAnother  year passed and the father was trying to plan another party for his  beloved son. Again he wanted the son to have everything and was prepared  to spend billions to accommodate his sons any wish so he asked what the  son wanted. Without even a pause the son said he wanted a whole truck  full of Pink Ping Pong balls. The father had put up with a few years of  wondering and had to ask what the son did with the Pink Ping Pong balls.  The son looked at the father for a few seconds the responded. \"Don't  worry I will tell you in due time.\"\n\nAlbeit  very curious about the Pink Ping Pong balls the father respect his son  and stopped asking. The day of the party the they where all transported  to the surface of Mars and met the real Martians. The daughters of the  king of Mars offered themselves to the son in sexual ways. I mean he is  18 now. After he had his way with them they filleted themselves and  presented eachother to be eaten by the son. After the meal which tasted  rather like a good smoked venison stake, they returned home it was time  to open the presents. the frozen head of Walt Disney and a true  recreation of Lola bunny for future sexual release set aside as the  father showed the son the semi truck full of Pink Ping Pong balls. The  son was ecstatic about this wonderful gift far more then another thing  he had received. The boy when into the the back of the truck and closed  the door. When he left out from the back of the truck five hours later  the truck was completely empty not a Pink Ping Pong ball in site.\n\nAnother  year passes and the father knew he needed to out do himself. The father  again asked the son what he wanted hesitant of the answer. Immediately  the son responded with how he wanted a whole warehouse full of Pink Ping  Pong balls. The father knew he had to find out what his son did with  the Pink Ping Pong balls but still didn't want to invade his son's  privacy. So he hatches a plan.\n\nThe  day of the party they enter a sub and went to the Lost City of the  Mirmaids. And met this queen of the city. The queen slept with the son  then offered her daughter as food for the feast. The son saw the  daughters beauty and rejected her offer to eat her and subsequently had  sex with the princess. Still a hunger the son asked the queen if she  wouldn't replace her daughter as the main course and the queen  reluctantly agreed. A nice white fish mixed with a succulent stake, both  the son and the Princess enjoyed the meal. And the son promised to keep  in contact.\n\nThe father brought  them back to the surface. As it was time to open the gifts. After  opening his platinum Suit of armor and a working lightsaber. The father  led the son to a car that would drive the son to the Son to the  warehouse. The driver was instructed by the father to ask about what the  son was doing in the warehouse and with the Pink Ping Pong balls.\n\nAs  they drove the driver asked questions artfully. But alas the son  skillfully doged the questions and the driver was left without an  answer. They pulled up to the ware house and the son got out. He  instructed the driver not to enter the warehouse and to return in the  morning. Out from the window the driver saw that the warehouse was in  fact full to the brim with Pink Ping Pong balls. In the morning the  driver returned to see that the warehouse house was in fact empty. Later  the father hired people to scoure the residence. But not a single Pink  Ping Pong ball was to be found.\n\nNow  the father was so curious that he had to find out be damned his sons  privacy so he planed to set up cameras and do whatever it took to find  out next year. But about a month before his birthday the son was in a  terrible accident and was put on life support. The father stayed by his  son every day and eventually the son did indeed wake up. The father  distraught over his sons predicament told him that he would get the son  anything anything he wanted. The son through his emense pain managed to  ask \"Father... dear Father can... You please... Get me... One Pink Ping  Pong ball.\"\n\nThe father blindsided by his sons request blurts out \"damn it what do you do with those damn Pink Ping Pong balls?\"\n\nThe son repostions himself because of the pain before responding \"I will tell you after you bring me the Pink Ping Pong ball\"\n\nThe  father calls up the man that had gotten the other Pink Ping Pong balls  and requested one more. If nothing else he would finally know about the  Pink Ping Pong balls. The father contact brings the last Pink Ping Pong  ball and the father sets it in front of the son. \"Now tell me... What...  What is it that you do with those Pink Ping Pong balls?\"\n\n\\`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.\n\n\\`I- I-'\n\nThen he died.",

I'm driving to my university but I know that I haven't been to any of the classes, done any of the homework, or taken any of the tests in a long time and the whole drive I'm just stressing about having missed so many classes.\n\nThen there's the dream that my husband dies. I have this one a lot when I'm feeling disconnected/frustrated/annoyed at him. In the dream, I know he's dead and I have this overwhelming feeling of loneliness and sadness and that I have never wanted something as much as to be able to see him again.

Nothing to motivate you. \n\n(By we and you - I mean me but some people could probably agree that this is how they feel as well) \n\nBut that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to ask friends and family how they\u2019re doing, and I mean how they\u2019re really doing. Listen to them vent even if it\u2019s for fucking HOUURSSS. It helps. It helps in SOO many ways because talking to someone we trust, helps us get shit that\u2019s eating us alive off us. Helps us be able to breathe, even if it\u2019s for a minute. Invite us out even if we say no, it makes us feel wanted. At some points force us to come out, say we aren\u2019t taking no for an answer. \n\nDepression is common because people don\u2019t look after one another like they used to.

            "inflation has caused college tuition to rise over 1100% housing cost over 700% and medical cost over 600% while wages to afford these things have stagnated in comparison to inflation. If we still lived by the gold standard, everyone would be making roughly less than a dollar an hour to a little bit above a dollar an hour. Even then, back in the 1950s people had an average income of 30k annually which in today's wages is over 320k after adjusting for inflation.\n\nWant to know why everyone is depressed? Everything has adjusted for inflation EXCEPT for how much money we make, so if we want to make enough money to afford an apartment complex and feed ourselves, we'd have to work over 90+ hours a week at three different jobs.\n\nNot including the fact that the recession left the current economic situation so FUBAR that people nowadays can't even get life started.  \nNow socioeconomically, imagine going to a family get together and your family brags about how \"They got their first home at 25!\" then goes on to insult you for how lazy you must be because your 3 different jobs barely pay you enough to feed and house yourself.",
            "Because people are being worked to death and have to live lives of uncertainty. People can barely afford to pay rent yet they are forced into debt in order to attain higher education to remain competitive and that increases the workload and responsibilities employers expect you to take on but nobody want to pay for it so people end up earning less than previous generations for doing more and harder work. And you can't really rebel against it because the competition for work is so fierce that you don't really have a leg to stand on since there's another indebted cunt who will be more than willing to take over your spot. But that doesn't change the fact that  they can barely make ends meet, so they have to take on another shift or perhaps an extra part-time job.\n\nThen when you start feeling depressed because you only seem to work and somehow still don't have enough money for rent the only advice you get is to start taking on even more work and economic load in the form of hauling your exhausted ass down the farmers market to buy fresh produce so that you can spend 1 hour of your already limited free time to cook healthy dinners that will magically cure you and also buying an expensive gym membership to a gym you don't really have time to go due to the fact you just spent that one hour cooking the magical dinner. Also, get 8-10 hours of sleep!\n\nThere are still 24 hours in a day, right? Because it sure as fuck seems like society is under the impression that there are 36 hours in a day now. Because how fucking else is it acceptable that people have to work 12-16 hour/day for basic survival while also cooking magical dinners, doing home chores, going to the gym, socializing with friends, finding true love, engaging in your hobby and getting 8 hours of sleep every night? No, that isn't possible. You need to sacrifice some of these things if you want to get by. And due to basic survival that will be everything that isn't work and money-related. I even know people who are in bad relationships only to alleviate the economic and work-related load of living. They literally can't get the days and months to go around as a single person. They can't afford to break off a bad relationship. What the fuck is this, the 1920's?\n\nIt has become an inescapable hamster wheel and nobody is sympathetic to it. Of course people are depressed.",

Well, we're super super poor, and she's not even our cat, so we much as we want to we just can't take her to the vet, so we set up a bed for her to rest up in inside the house and try to take care of her. She lays around miserable for a few days, then one day I'm laying down for a nap and she comes and lays on my bed. She starts meowing, and I start to smell something kinda bad.

Which means that on top, I have about 2 inches of space to work with, and underneath is so curved that only my skinny ass wrists will fit--no tools. There are 3 bolts--one on top, two on bottom--and my socket wrench could only move one click at a time with some fighting. Getting the bolts out took 10-15 minutes each. I put the housing gasket in, closed it, and tested it. Still leaking. So I unbolted it *back* up, applied liquid gasket to either side of the physical foam gasket, and finger tightened it. Then you have to wait an hour for the liquid gasket to dry before tightening it all the way.\n\nAfter the hour, I went to tighten the bolts. Got one. Got the second. I turned the third four times and *SNAP*. It seared right through the threading. Inside the housing. So I had to unbolt it BACK up, scrape off the now ruined gasket (luckily it came in a pack of two), and get the bolt out. The bolt was sticking out one thread. I grabbed a set of needle nose pliers (the only thing that would fit) and began the painstakingly slow process of turning the bolt with the pliers, two inches of space at a time. It took half an hour.\n\nLuckily my old, now dead car used the same bolts, so I snagged one off of it. While I was at it and already pretty frustrated, I went and rummaged around for another half hour before finding a bolt screwdriver that was the exact right size to fit under the piping and at least mostly tighten the bolts.\n\nPutting the entire setup together the third time took 20 minutes plus waiting time for the liquid gasket to dry.",
            "The list is long. Removing PCV hose, assorted vacuum lines, O2 sensor, etc thinking they are going to get better performance.\n Cutting a wire under the dash to hook up a stereo. Then bringing the car to me to fix the tail lights. \n Pouring 3 quarts of oil in but the dipstick still shows low because they put the oil in the radiator.\n Putting gasoline in a diesel truck...again.",

            "Learn to cook. Everyone appreciates a good meal, especially someone wanting a partner.",
            "Here are some dating tips:\n\n* Do: Plan activities that solicit conversation. Excellent examples are: Meals, Mini-Golf, Art Galleries, Antique Shopping, Gardens, Museums, and Festivals. \n* Don't: Pick an activity that actively prevents conversation. Examples: Bars, Movies, Loud Concerts, Mime Practice.\n* Do: Take the time to plan the date. Pick-up, Meal, Activity 1, Short Activity (like Ice Cream), goodbye. Share the date plan at the start and be flexible (date may have had a tragic ice cream accident). \n* Do: Pay for anything that costs money if you planned the dare. If you planned dinner at X location and activity Y afterwards, pay. This isn't a man-thing. Planning activities puts an obligation on the other person. If the other person wants to chip-in or pay for, like coffee later, let them. \n* Sex: Can happen on a first date, but try not to. Seriously. If you are looking to cure the disease that is loneliness, constant one-night encounters will deepen your loneliness. If you are not lonely, and want to have lots of sex, go for it.\n* Sex: Bring a condom, and keep it in the packaging. Don't try and hide it in your wallet or something dumb. Just put the box in your glove-box, backpack, etc. If questioned, be honest. \"I don't know what tonight will bring, but I care enough about myself to be prepared.\"\n* Sex: If sex happens, wear the condom. If you don't, you are an asshole to every partner after this fling and irresponsible in general. Be better.\n* Wear: Wear clothing appropriate to your activities and is clean. Don't \"dress-up\" as something you are not. Wear nice clothing, sure, but if you are not Sports Jacket Man, don't wear the sports jacket.\n* Wear: Deodorant. Apply before date. Remember, people can smell you before you can smell you.\n* Be: On time. Try and hit 5-10 minutes early. If something happens, CALL and let the other person know. Don't drop a bunch of excuses either. Say you are going to be late and give an estimated time of arrival.\n\nConfidence\n\nConfidence comes from knowing who you are and being willing to show other people that 'you.' Nervousness in general is fine. But if you are fearful in talking with folks or have mounting social anxiety when meeting new people, that is normal and can be overcome. NO ONE ON REDDIT will fix it for you. However, a professional, such as Therapist, Counselor, or Psychiatrist will be better equipped to isolate and assist in finding the issues that are inhibiting your confidence. You are not expected to know everything about a car, why would you be expected to know everything about the human experience. Go talk to someone if you find your day-to-day activities are impacted by this. AT WORST you are out 100 bucks and an hour of your time.",

Pretending to be someone you aren't is exhausting and you can't keep it up forever. It is wasting your time and their time. If someone likes you for who you are, a relationship will grow.

I kept excusing myself so that they can talk among themselves (**and so that I could actually do my job**) but they kept hounding me so I had no choice but to help them.\n\nBitch. You probably had months to arrange this trip, and you still have no idea where to go and what to do???",

The people in the souvenir shop spoke fluent mandarin and everything was labeled in chinese kanji or something.

Then, he put on not one, but TWO cock rings in order to stay hard.\n\nNow, I'm a bit of a bleeder- if there's a drop or two on the condom, it doesn't mean he was too rough, it just happens sometimes. But Jesus fucking Christ did he ever finger me hard! That jackhammer motion that you see in porn. And blood like one of my light days followed it. He asked me to make some noise for him (basically to moan like the porn girls) but despite making some dumb decisions about my sex life, I absolutely refuse to fake it.\n\nThe whole thing just felt like I was interchangeable to him, and his mood felt more performance-anxious than genuinely enjoying it. \n\nAnother guy had this obsession with me being very young. I think I was about 24 but he'd make comments about me being 18 or something. And he didn't want to do anything that would actually prepare me for intercourse (ie fingering) because he was more obsessed with \"tightness\" than my actual enjoyment. That ended when I got mad at him for demanding anal and yelled at him for being bad in bed and told him he'd never pleasured me.\n\nPSA: if a woman is very tight, it's because she's not very aroused! This makes you a bad lover for continuing to penetration before she's ready! It's better to not do it at all. Fortunately, the vagina does not get \"loose\" if a woman is very experienced or aroused, because it's a muscle.

Yes during this time Mussolini has a chance of still rising to power in Italy but it won't be much of a threat as the Italian military is incredibly weak and they even had to invade Ethiopia, a poor, landlocked African nation, twice to defeat it.\n\nBut if we combine this with removing Benito Mussolini, fascism won't even be invented as an ideology, giving no base ideology for Hitler, Italy would also likely not turn into a full on dictatorship without some political influential person like Mussolini coming on the scene",

Kinda wish he\u2019d kept that one to himself but there you go.\n\nI\u2019d seen it coming for a few months so while hurtful, it wasn\u2019t a shock. We were attending different unis, and we\u2019d call each other every day but he had become more and more disinterested in our conversations, and when he visited, all we ever did was visit his brother who lived in the town I studied in, so I knew what was coming when we met up back home over the summer break.\n\nI said okay, and I wished him well. \n\nWithin a couple of weeks he blocked me and ensured that our circle of friends (most of whom I\u2019d been friends with since I was 6) stuck by his side because he had the cool party house back in our hometown and I didn\u2019t.\n\nThey kept going over there during holidays when we were all back home. I tried to convince them to do stuff somewhere else but he was always the cooler one. So I stopped seeing them.\n\nI never got an explanation as to why he ghosted me.  His mum had cancer at that point. I went to visit her because she had become inextricably intertwined in my growth as a person. She told me she thinks he made a stupid decision and wished he\u2019d stuck it out with me. She hoped we\u2019d get married. She died a few months later. The last time I saw him was at her funeral.\n\nUntil last year (10 years later), I still had the occasional nightmare about it, where I\u2019d see him and ask him why he went nuclear on me after making me promise we\u2019d stay friends.\n\nMy theory is that he was upset by the fact that I wasn\u2019t upset when we broke up, and moved on quickly and quietly with my life while we jumped from one girl to the next.

            "you need good hearing eyesight and health,take flying lessons asap",
            "Ok as an Actual pilot theres a few ways you can go about it.\n\n\n* Gliders, your at the *perfect* age for Gliders, IIRC you can solo at 14 and get a certificate at 16. Makes you a good stick and rudder pilot. \n\n* Private Pilot. You wont be able to solo until 16 but its what most everyone starts at. Its expensive but if your smart enough with your money its not prohibitively expensive. My suggestion is, do a lot of the ground school before hand (The Aviation Texts are free on the FAA Website, Look up the FAR/AIM, PHAK and Airplane Flying Handbook) and find the cheapest plane on the field you can rent. I often laugh at the guys getting their initial done in a $250/hr SR-22 when they could be spending $50 in a Champ. \n\n* Get a Intro flight first in different types, So Do a Intro in Helicopters, Fixed wing and Glider before you decide what to do. that being said.\n\n* Helicopter Market is over saturated but a hell of a gig if you can get into it. You want a fun job, go Helicopters, you want a Paying job, go Fixed wing.\n\n* Fixed Wing is in demand right now. When the Airlines start wining about lack of pilots you know the shortage is here.\n\n* Simulators help after your initial PPL. Before hand its aid outside of aircraft familiarization is negligible. that being said you can learn a lot from a nickles worth of electricity. \n\n* Pay attention to your CFI and do your homework. No one wants to be a repeat lesson because you didn't do the readings.\n\n* Look into the EAA Young Eagles program for more info pertaining to your age group.\n\nThats all I can think of off hand. If you have any civilian pilot related questions just PM me.",
            "Start saving money. The cost can be a little daunting. I think I spent close to $8000 to get my private license with single-engine prop VFR only. I spend another $3000 to get IFR and multi-engine. If you want to fly commercially, that\u2019s at least another $10-$15,000 on top. But I definitely don\u2019t regret it, it was money well spent.

After about 15 seconds of an entire high school freshman English class watching porn,  Brandon finally turned back to the announcement channel.\n\nWhat's really weird is that when our teacher came in she didn't believe when we told her what happened so she went to the same channel.\n\nAnd that's the story of how I accidentally watched porn with my English teacher.\n\nAnd yes, she told the adminstration and they took care of it, the channel wasn't there the next day lol\n\nWe were never told how or why this was possible, unfortunately, because I've always been curious.",

        "bestcomment": [
            "So self harm is a mechanism used to hurt yourself, in order to give your physical pain dominance over the chaos and pain within. People also do it because the pain makes you numb and things seem to become less significant for a few moments (speaking from experience, all of this).\nHowever, I have learnt that working out and going hard at the gym or in any sport or exercise is a much better alternative. That way, you're hurting yourself too (muscle tear and muscle ache) but you're constantly healing yourself and becoming stronger. Endorphin release also makes you feel better about yourself, and oxytocin release makes you feel like the world is safer.\nI've lost over 15kg in the last 4 months by eating healthy and working out instead of cutting. I still do punch walls and have damaged my knuckles, but they heal.\nIt sucks to be in such a place, but you're stronger than you think you are. You're larger than the problem, so don't make the problem seem bigger than you.\nGood luck <3",

Something like art can become very frustrating to do after a while)",
            "Lots of these answers, while well-intentioned, seem to come from a place of little understanding. They propose some very good courses of action - like helping yourself, meditating, being creative or working on fixing your mental problems. But they fail to understand that something far more rudimentary is needed first to make the step away from self harm (or the total loss of functionality that can come of depression).\n\nMy attitude has always been, \"if it's worth doing, it's worth doing poorly.\" Even if half-functionality is all you can manage, just do what you can, because anything is better than nothing. If it's all you can do to put yourself to bed instead of carry on through the night, start with that. I know it may be overly-simplistic, but **if** you happen to go to a much darker place at night, just move yourself to the bathroom, then into bed, before you can really process whether or not you're ready to.\n\nIf that's entirely unhelpful, I will say that digital escapes - youtube, reddit - while potentially very problematic on their own, are still far superior to physical self harm.",

Then I overheard some kids talking about how I was just seeking attention. I realized I actually did sound like that. It made me stop and think for a while. I realized what I was doing wasn\u2019t good. It just made people feel bad or uncomfortable. I just kept my negativity to myself from then on. Then I realized why I was doing this to myself. In elementary I wasn\u2019t very well liked. People would get upset because I\u2019d win a lot of contests and get good grades. I guess they just thought that I didn\u2019t really deserve anything good? I wasn\u2019t ever mean to anybody, in fact a lot of the \u201cmean\u201d kids were actually nice to me. I guess I was just sort of a loser. A lot of smarter, but more popular and more liked people would try to push me down and make me feel guilty. Not all of them, but most. It worked and I guess I just sort of got into a habit of pushing myself down for them without even knowing. I didn\u2019t want them to hate me. I had this mindset that anything positive about myself was bad and selfish. If I brought it up or displayed it I thought I was making people feel bad, and sometimes I\u2019d go as far as feeling guilty for even thinking I\u2019d be anything compared to others. I don\u2019t push myself down as much as before, but I still do a little bit. I\u2019m working on it. I\u2019m so glad I moved and got away from those kind of people when I was younger. I can\u2019t imagine how I\u2019d have turned out if I continued to press myself down and feel guilty like that."

In the end I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Depression. \n\nMy biggest symptoms were pretty much everything typical with ADHD-PI \u2013 bad attention to detail, difficulty staying focused, forgetfulness, difficulty following instructions, difficulty prioritizing tasks, etc....\n\nBUT it wasn't the symptoms that made me seek a diagnosis. What made me seek a diagnosis was the impact this thing \u2013 which I didn't have a name for \u2013 had on my life. \n\nPost-high school my world seemed to crumble and I saw no future for myself. I was incredibly depressed and I'd resigned myself to the fact that I'd never function in this world because I wasn't made for it \u2013 I was destined for failure, and I deserved it. \n\nOne night I realized that there was more to it. I realized that there might be something wrong and somebody might be able help me. Even if I wasn't made to function in this world, I still had to if I wanted to live a pleasant life. So, I did some research and got a referall to a psychologist who diagnosed me over three sessions.\n\nEDIT: forgot to add how I manage. I take Concerta, apply strategies, and I see a therapist (I recognize the privilege in being able to afford see a therapist when I know not everyone who is diagnosed can). \n\nI try to create as much structure for myself as I can, I write a lot of things down, I don't overbook myself, I'm mindful of my distractions...there's a lot I do that helps...it'll never go away, but management helps!",

I have the tendency to jump from one topic to another without really thinking about it. I find it hard to concentrate and focus. \n\nNow there is another HUGE issue that I have because of it. I have NO motivation for things that arent \"new\" or \"different\". I have trouble doing my daily tasks and handling basic stuff because I dont feel like its bringing me anything. It comes from the way the ADHD brain is wired and handles the pleasure and feelings brought by neurotransmiters like dopamine and serotonin. \n\nAs for the \"tests\" for some reason I just had to anwser a little questionnaire and my psychiatrist diagnosed me afterwards.\n\nShe prescribed me Ritalin and to be honest it saved my life. I am now taking the alternative Concerta, which is the same compound but with a longer effect. When I take my meds, I can \\*do\\* stuff again. Its like I never was in that slump and honestly, I feel like I can be myself again...."

Something has to be done.\n\nThere are two people perspectives I have on it:\n\n* Cost / Care provided\n\n* Access to your data\n\nI believe with m4a that we could bring down the costs. I don't have faith in our government implementing a plan that would increase or keep care provided at the same level. I feel that we are likely to get worse healthcare solutions. The average person may be ok as they just have minor doctor things and don't need to see a doctor frequently or visit specialists. I fear that me family members may not get the care they need and could suffer.\n\nAs for access to your data, that's very important for me and should be for everyone. The government had been bad at building these types of databases and tools. There are ones out there that work for specific functions like claims processing, but not will designed to pull data from. If the government does the usual going for lowest bidder to build an app and website then likely you will just have a terrible experience getting data.\n\nIf or government can surprise me and work together for America then I think it could work. I just don't have faith this is going to work out well for anyone who needs ongoing care and could lead to approval care or deaths sure to how poor care would be.\n\nI do understand I sound doom and gloomy, but I've had a lot of thought on this issue and believe it to be a reality if we go down this path with our current political climate."

If sentence then 500k will suffice, if conversation then I should inform you I am Dad and I will see you later, alligator. \n5. My friends recommend most of the dirty shit I look at, and that which they don't recommend is tame by their standards. So maybe buy us a carton of tinnies and we'll call it square.\n6.

Drunk uncles and cousins end up on the roof (there have been injuries) making reindeer stomping noises and the young kids really get excited. I\u2019m mid 50s and this has been a tradition well before I was born.  \n\nI have a ton of stories about Santa on xmas eve.    One of the most memorable a few years ago when one of my cousins kids played Santa.   His girlfriend went up to sit on Santa\u2019s lap and get her gift.  She didn\u2019t know it was him at first. The gift she opened was her ring and he proposed.  It was really sweet but it took her forever to say yes.  I thought for a few minutes she was going to say no.  In front of his entire extended family.  So Santa got his wish this time.\n\nAnother cousin ended up becoming a professional Santa... real beard and all.   He is the official Santa of some major Xmas events in our area and is on local TV and radio.  A lot. (Off topic... sorry... I just love the fact this is my family member). He\u2019s an Uber driver as well and drives in full Santa garb during the holidays. \n\nI love my family  \u2764\ufe0f",

            "They're just... Fun. Some of them are irredeemable shots for sure, but the majority of them are just fun. The games they come up with are hilarious. You can do the dumbest shit and they'll die with laughter, and their laughter is always so enjoyable to hear. I work as a daycare assistant and 15 percent of my job is just throwing shit around or playing pretend. The things they say can be so stupid or so poignant. \n\nI think the best part is is that when they love you you know they REALLY love you. I go to school in another city so I work during the summer and then come back to visit sometimes. \n\nEvery single visit there's this one kid. He's rough around the edges, has had a tough start. Still working out how to do this school thing, trying to manage ADD. Can be snarky. Can be a bit rude. But the moment he sees me walk through those doors after a few months of not seeing me he lights up like a Christmas tree and all but jumps into my arms to give me a hug. He asks me how I'm doing, what courses I'm taking, if I'm been eating okay, and catches me up with his life..\n\nI've spent maybe a grand total of three hours with this kid as his teacher. But his genuine happiness to see me is just like... Holy crap."

We held onto the mattress for dear life while the winds from them going crazy high speeds kept ripping it from our grip until the mattress flew behind us and almost slammed into the windshield of our friends that were racing us. \n\nWe took the rest out to desert and set it on fire without surveying the scene and apparently people liked to use the area to shoot off guns for fun so there were used and unused shell casings and ammo everywhere. The furniture made a huge fire that caught the gun powder from the ammo and bullets, and started shooting off in every direction. Me and one friend hid behind our truck, another friend who was inspecting a hole (comedically like \"oh whats in here??\") jumped the fuck inside, and someone else climbing over a boulder fell off it and almost took the boulder with him on top of himself so he was almost crushed to death.\n\nAbout 20 or so bullets went off before it finally stopped.

As in, house staff who work for one generation of the family are \"inherited\" by the next. They're essentially people who are being given away like goods.\n\nThe staff aren't slaves or anything terrible like that. Based on what I know, they're treated and paid well, which is why they've been working for this particular family for three generations.

            "This is right up my alley. I\u2019m a private chef and I work on superyachts. I can\u2019t mention the names of my clients due to NDAs, but I will say that I\u2019ve worked for some of the wealthiest people in the world, very close to the top of the Forbes list. I\u2019ve actually had mostly good encounters in my times, but you hear a lot of stories in this industry. \n\nThe funniest thing I ever saw was a time I was on a trip in the Caribbean on this very small secluded island with a wealthy family. The dad was the breadwinner, he owned several massive businesses. Pretty down to earth guy though if I do say so. So we\u2019re on his yacht anchored off this small island, and he decides he wants to see his buddies for dinner. They had a tradition of prank calling people and laughing their asses off, and they wanted to carry on this tradition even though this guy was on vacation this time. He sent out 2 of his private jets to go and collect his friends who were throughout the US, and then had a chartered smaller plane waiting for them in Florida to take them to the yacht for dinner. His jets were too big to land on the small island airstrip. So his friends come in for dinner after being picked up by his jets and whatnot, and they proceed to have their fun prank calling folks and asking the usual \u201cis your refrigerator running\u201d type questions and laughing their asses off. They were there for all of 2 hours, said goodnight, and then got shuttled home by the private planes again. All for a few hours or prank calls. Things like hanging out with your bros become so easy at that level of wealth. Most people are lucky to see their friends from across the country once a year if that, but this guy just dispatched 2 private jets on a whim, spur of the moment thought. \n\nAnother one that stood out to me was a very wealthy lady I worked for. She had a teenage daughter, and this lady liked to allow her daughter to drink, grey goose was their favorite. The teenage daughter got absolutely plastered drunk, and the mom barely batted an eye. She had thrown up all over herself and was barely conscious. The mother instructed one of the other girls who worked onboard the yacht to carry her daughter back down to her cabin, and shower her off and get her to bed. This poor girl working for them had to carry this limp, vomit covered 16 year old girl down a few flights of stairs, had to strip her down to her underwear, and then get in the shower with this girl to hold her up and wash the puke out of her hair. She finally got the younger girl cleaned up, meanwhile she was soaking wet wearing all her clothes and now covered in flecks of vomit. The girl who worked there says she could still smell it for days. Felt bad for that one.\n\nThe last thing I remembered was a time that the yacht guests wanted to have a Hawaiian party that night, with tiki torches, Palm trees, coconuts, and roast pig. Only problem was we were anchored off of a tiny island that was nothing but sand. I ended up having to make a last minute order by sea plane to have 200 coconuts, a whole pig, tiki torches and palm fronds delivered. Couple hours later and many thousands of dollars gone, the plane touched down right near us and the party went on without a hitch. That one just stands out to me because at the snap of their fingers they can decide they want a roasted pig, and somehow us crew have to find a way to make it happen. \n\nLuckily I haven\u2019t dealt with too many UHNWIs who treated me terribly, most were actually rather respectful. It seems like the old way of treating your help like slaves is going out of style, and would most likely draw scorn from their friends. Even if they don\u2019t really care that much about us I\u2019m still thankful if they say please and thank you and that kind of thing. \n\nI have a bunch of stories about this stuff, if anyone has questions feel free to ask, I\u2019m pretty open about most of it as long as I don\u2019t break any confidentiality in regards to names/personal information.",

            "Back in high school my science class was known to be very disruptive and difficult to handle, my favorite subject at school was science so I never participated in the shenanigans.\n\nOne day our female teacher must have had some issues in her personal life this day and when she came in for our morning double period (80mins) she seemed quite down and lethargic, the students must have smelt the sadness in her! And everyone started asking stupid questions over each other obviously to try and over load her. \n\nWhen she had enough she screamed 'STOP!' While tears rolled down her face. The students knew that they have her in her most vulnerable.\nThen, all together started to sing 'the wheels on the bus' out of tune and out of sync and also at different pitches. This was even agonizing for me to experience it must have been horrible for her.\n\nI look over to the teacher and she is standing with perfect posture like a soldier with her hands at her side, tears streaming down her face and her lower lip quivering. You could even see her deep long breaths trying to calm herself but the students were unforgiving. They all start singing different nursery rhymes and even popular pop songs for that time. This went on for at least 30 mins, but the entire time the teacher continues crying but standing like a soldier. Anybody with an ounce of compassion could notice this had broken her mentally. \n\nAfter a while the lead teacher for the science decision heard the chanting and came in to stop everything (He was the kind of teacher you didn't fuck with) and brought silence to the class. \n\nAnyway the lead teacher walked our teacher out of class and everyone but me and my friend (who didn't participate) were given several days detention and our teacher quit that day and never returned. \n\nI hope she's doing okay. This was like 10 years ago.",

My drama teacher fond my improv to be so amusing he added it to the final.\n\nThen there was an incident on the day before the premiere when we were doing rehearsals where the actor for Professor Q forgot to put the break on his wheelchair and he rolled down and fell onto the school orchestra. He nearly broke the arm of the double bass player, he gave the triangle player a minor concussion, he destroyed the drums with the chair (and the actor himself nearly broke his collarbone.)\n\nThe play was delayed by a week due to the injuries.\n\nI laughed when he fell, I knew I shouldn't have but I did",

            "I've told this story before but it honestly has impacted the way I think about my actions. I was maybe four years old at the time in a givens bookstore. I was begging my mom for a hot chocolate from the cafe in the back and reluctantly she gave me that $1 that it cost. Now this is little Swiss me who could not want anything more than chocolate in this world and in those moments my entire life's focus was to get that hot chocolate. So I run over to the counter and asked this woman for a hot chocolate and she brings up the total was 1.09$ because of tax. I have only had $1 and little four-year-old me pretty much gave up on the spot but this big burly old man, the type you expect to be in a gritty bar scene, just slid a dime over to the woman behind the counter paying for the last 9 cents. And it shouldn't be a big deal though, just a man giving a kid a dime out of the kindness of his heart but to me when I was four it meant so much more than that. Because them almost nothing no time no real money but to me it was going from a really really sad pouty 4 year old to having my favorite thing in the entire world. So now decades later whenever I sync my actions might be too small or insignificant impact someone else's life I always think back to that man and I always at least try.",

I believe what I think is backed up by fact and is within reason, and I dislike the fact that some families ram organized religion down their children\u2019s throats from a young age. This does not mean that I am an atheist. I believe in an afterlife, and it is within reason that there may be a god(s) somewhere. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t like the whole idea that my life is predestined by someone else. \n\nAnyway, my own version of an afterlife is a place not so dissimilar to the world we live in now. It may take the shape of a place you frequent and are fond of, or a place that you were at once and feel very connected to. These places will be filled with other people/animals that were a part of your life, and you may visit them/they may visit you as if you were traveling to see them. They will appear to be the age you are comfortable with (i.e., grandparents still old) but they to themselves can be whatever age they please. It is a linked experience, where all of those who have passed may communicate with one another. \n\nThe time will be passed by doing what you love to do, and at any point you may be passed on again to be either recycled (reincarnated) or pass on completely. This option will be forced upon you if everyone who has memory of your name joins you in the afterlife, creating a theoretical cap to how many may \u201clive\u201d in the afterlife. \n\nTime in the afterlife will continue at the same rate as on earth, so it is possible affect the world of the living from time to time.

So the only option left for you now is to suddenly shift into another gear which somehow makes you go faster.\n\nNow, which way are they shifting? Up? or down?\n\nAnd if shifting could somehow give you this added speed, why were you waiting to shift anyway?\n\nThe reason it is especially bad in Ford vs Ferrari is that it occurs in a race on the Mulsanne straight where both cars would be going flat out, yet somehow, Ken Miles is just flying down that straight keeping some extra gear in reserve that he doesn't use until the Ferrari catches him and he needs just a bit more speed.",
