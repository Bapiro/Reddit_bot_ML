He loved to joke with those around him, and he would tease the ever loving hell out of everyone he could.  \n\nI remember him using his motorised scooter to get around backstage and his poor assistant would speed walk to keep up with him, but he would just keep increasing the speed until she was running beside him. A wicked grin on his face the whole time. \n\nOr how he would constantly make his staff repeat themselves \"what I didn't hear you!\" Untill they had repeated themselves four times, witnessing that initially made me sad, thinking his hearing was poor, until he looks at me with that same grin and winks.  \n\nMy time with him was short, but I'm so glad I got it, this man changed my life before I even met him, and he made a huge impact when I did as well.   \n\nRIP Stan.

            "Sorry if this ends up being long but its angered me for quite some time.\n\nAbout ten years ago my mother at age 69 had a massive stroke. They didn't expect her to live let alone come out of it mostly alright. Which she did except for some vision loss in her left eye. (Not total, just peripheral.) So she can only see perfectly straight out of that eye.\n\nSo after about a year recovering from the stroke and the ensuing infection from the surgery that ended up being worse then the stroke itself she decides she wants to go get tested to see if she can retain her drivers license. (Required by law in my province of Canada).\n\nMy father was not well either as he had a long term terminal illness so I pack them both up in my truck and take them to the DMV. Me and my father happily assuming there is no fucking way in hell she will pass. \n\nAside from her vision issues, the amazingly quick witted and swift woman I grew up with was VERY unsure of her self at all times and took forever to make the smallest decisions. It broke my heart and it didn't even occur to me to be scared that she would get her license back.\n\nWell she did, passed with \"Flying colors\" the DMV guy said. As a SAR (Search and Rescue) tech, the idea of taking him up in the helicopter and throwing him out without a rope occurred to me.\n\n1 week later, accident number one. T-boned a poor lady as she was coming out of the grocery store. Not much damage and no injuries thankfully. Mother still refused to admit she wasn't fit to drive.\n\nMonth later, accident 2. She panics on a multi-lane cross city road and ends up on the raised median and rips the entire exhaust system off her car. Still won't admit any issues.\n\nAt this point I'm amazed I didn't have ulcers. Shortly after accident 2 my father passed away. I did everything up to and including begging to get her to give up the license. She wouldn't do it and for the next few months I spent every day with a knot in my stomach until I spoke to her around 6pm every night once she was \"home from running around\" \n\nThen around 1pm I get a call from her cell phone, this phone I bought her that she mostly ignored except to charge it. I couldn't understand a word she said she was so upset on the phone. I managed to get her general location out of her and hopped in a car and more then exceeded the speed limit getting down there.\n\nUpon arriving there are two ambulances, shoes in front of her car and its up on the curb.\n\nShe's sitting on the curb next to it bawling her eyes out and I'm terrified she's killed someone.\n\nTurns out a man and his son were walking out of the soccer pitch next to the road, began to cross on the cross walk and she didn't see them.\n\nShe thankfully only struck the father and aside from being banged up he wasn't super seriously injured.\n\nBecause of my job I knew most of the police officers in the city so one of them offered to follow me back to her house so she could take me back down to get her car.\n\nBy the time I had done so and got back to her condo she had stopped crying. Threw me the extra set of keys to the car she had and told me to get rid of the car.\n\nShe even tried to get the DMV worker that passed her fired after that. She immediately realized she shouldn't of ever gotten it back. She was actually terrified that she had been driving like that.\n\nYears later she still comments about how she never even saw the man and his son and how she could of killed one or both of them.\n\nI have all the respect in the world for seniors. My mother was one of the first women CEO's in this province and was a hellcat in her day. I learned a lot from her. But I also learned to accept limitations.\n\nIf you are older reading this post. If you think for even a second that you could maybe not be the safest person to be on the road, talk to and listen to your loved ones.\n\nIts horrible to give up that freedom, it would be more horrible for you to kill some innocent person because you are too proud to give it up.\n\n\n**EDIT** Thanks for the gold mysterious stranger!",

            "As someone who's struggled with suicidal thoughts and still do on occasion I'd like to advice against a trend I've noticed on reddit, and it's this thing about instantly linking to suicide prevention organizations. I personally understand that it's ment with good intent, but on someone who is suicidal and not quite in their right mind it often has the opposite effect of where it feels like you're being shoved into a corner or dumped as someone elses problem. More often than not someone suicidal wants to talk to a normal person, someone who will care or listen to them, of course I am not telling strangers that you have to be that person - I know it shouldn't be anyone elses responsibility, all I am trying to say is that if you really want to help someone or make them feel better, linking them to something else is not a great way to go about it, it's much better worked into a conversation as a suggestion on the side.\n\nAgain, I don't want to come off as a dick here - I think it's great that so many people care enough to want to encourage others to seek help, but try to keep this in mind. That feeling of being pushed away or getting a predictable and generic answer often makes you feel more isolated and more depressed.",

            "I attempted suicide at 19. I think the hardest thing for non-suicidal people to understand is that a lot of suicidal people don't want to kill themselves, they just want to stop existing. \n\nActually going through the steps of writing a note and taking the pills was extremely difficult and all I kept thinking the whole time was that it would be so much easier if I could just fall asleep and never wake up. It was *scary* to think that I was potentially killing myself whereas a death I couldn't control or had less control over would just...happen. Then there's everyone and everything else to consider. I also have caught myself wishing many times that the whole world would end so that I could stop existing but then neither myself nor my loved ones would have to deal with the pain or miss out on a good life. \n\nI found those things really hard to articulate at 19. It's how a lot of depressed people feel. ",

            "I did not write this but have permission to share.\n\nJust saw this elsewhere on the internet in reference to recent events. For obvious reasons (at least, for anyone who has had to listen to me bitch about how much I hate winter), it really resonated with me...\n\n*****\nWhen you have depression it\u2019s like it snows every day.\n\nSome days it\u2019s only a couple of inches. It\u2019s a pain in the ass, but you still make it to work, the grocery store. Sure, maybe you skip the gym or your friend\u2019s birthday party, but it IS still snowing and who knows how bad it might get tonight. Probably better to just head home.  Your friend notices, but probably just thinks you are flaky now, or kind of an asshole.\n\nSome days it snows a foot. You spend an hour shoveling out your driveway and are late to work. Your back and hands hurt from shoveling. You leave early because it\u2019s really coming down out there. Your boss notices.\n\nSome days it snows four feet. You shovel all morning but your street never gets plowed. You are not making it to work, or anywhere else for that matter. You are so sore and tired you just get back in bed. By the time you wake up, all your shoveling has filled back in with snow. Looks like your phone rang; people are wondering where you are. You don\u2019t feel like calling them back, too tired from all the shoveling. Plus they don\u2019t get this much snow at their house so they don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re still stuck at home. They just think you\u2019re lazy or weak, although they rarely come out and say it.\n\nSome weeks it\u2019s a full-blown blizzard. When you open your door, it\u2019s to a wall of snow. The power flickers, then goes out. It\u2019s too cold to sit in the living room anymore, so you get back into bed with all your clothes on. The stove and microwave won\u2019t work so you eat a cold Pop Tart and call that dinner. You haven\u2019t taken a shower in three days, but how could you at this point? You\u2019re too cold to do anything except sleep.\n\nSometimes people get snowed in for the winter. The cold seeps in. No communication in or out. The food runs out. What can you even do, tunnel out of a forty foot snow bank with your hands? How far away is help? Can you even get there in a blizzard? If you do, can they even help you at this point? Maybe it\u2019s death to stay here, but it\u2019s death to go out there too.\n\nThe thing is, when it snows all the time, you get worn all the way down. You get tired of being cold. You get tired of hurting all the time from shoveling, but if you don\u2019t shovel on the light days, it builds up to something unmanageable on the heavy days. You resent the hell out of the snow, but it doesn\u2019t care, it\u2019s just a blind chemistry, an act of nature. It carries on regardless, unconcerned and unaware if it buries you or the whole world.\n\nAlso, the snow builds up in other areas, places you can\u2019t shovel, sometimes places you can\u2019t even see. Maybe it\u2019s on the roof. Maybe it\u2019s on the mountain behind the house. Sometimes, there\u2019s an avalanche that blows the house right off its foundation and takes you with it. A veritable Act of God, nothing can be done. The neighbors say it\u2019s a shame and they can\u2019t understand it; he was doing so well with his shoveling.\n\n-\n\nI don\u2019t know how it went down for Anthony Bourdain or Kate Spade. It seems like they got hit by the avalanche, but it could\u2019ve been the long, slow winter. Maybe they were keeping up with their shoveling. Maybe they weren\u2019t. Sometimes, shoveling isn\u2019t enough anyway. It\u2019s hard to tell from the outside, but it\u2019s important to understand what it\u2019s like from the inside.\n\nI firmly believe that understanding and compassion have to be the base of effective action. It\u2019s important to understand what depression is, how it feels, what it\u2019s like to live with it, so you can help people both on an individual basis and a policy basis. I\u2019m not putting heavy shit out here to make your Friday morning suck. I know it feels gross to read it, and realistically it can be unpleasant to be around it, that\u2019s why people pull away.\n\nI don\u2019t have a message for people with depression like \u201ckeep shoveling.\" It\u2019s asinine.  Of course you\u2019re going to keep shoveling the best you can, until you physically can\u2019t, because who wants to freeze to death inside their own house? We know what the stakes are. My message is to everyone else. Grab a fucking shovel and help your neighbor. Slap a mini snow plow on the front of your truck and plow your neighborhood. Petition the city council to buy more salt trucks, so to speak.  \n\nDepression is blind chemistry and physics, like snow. And like the weather, it is a mindless process, powerful and unpredictable with great potential for harm. But like climate change, that doesn\u2019t mean we are helpless. If we want to stop losing so many people to this disease, it will require action at every level.\n\nEdit: Feel free to share this with anyone or anywhere you think it might help. We aren't alone. Even when there's warm bodies around when we are cold we still shiver. Offer a blanket.\n\nEdit 2: I just want to say thank you and you're welcome to everyone who is commenting and can relate.

            "I bought a dog. \n\nI have a very busy life, so people ask me if I regret having her, since dogs are all high maintenance. I need to walk her a few times a day, feed her, keep her entertained, clean up after her, remove dog hair from everything including myself with an unending supply of lint rollers. \n\nI don't regret it. I got her for one purpose that I won't tell them. Because I'm lonely. Because when I'm at my loneliest, I don't have anyone to turn to, no-one to go see, to talk to, despite my best efforts. I have her because I know if I died, something would miss me, so I can't leave her. \n\nI left her at the dog boarding for an extra day after getting back from a work trip, earlier this week. I found myself calling for her, and she wouldn't come. For the first time in years, I just cried. I missed her. I wanted to sit on the couch and just pet her like she always loves. Fortunately, I could just grab her the next day. But it reminded me how important she is to my mental health. \n\nI recently turned down a job that would have required me to move to a place where I would have even less familial and friend support. I would have been traveling most of the year, so I would have to give up my dog. I'm glad I did. I had one friend tell me to \"absolutely not take the job\"; he said if I took it, he gave me 6 months before I jumped off a bridge. I can't say he would be wrong. \n\nI used work to redirect my loneliness over the past several years, which ended up making it worse as it alienated me from those that I was close to. And then the company abandoned me; hired someone above me that openly tells people inside and outside of the company that he's trying to fire me. I have the CEO and President behind me, so he can't touch me; they know what I did for the company, my sacrifice, my skill, my dedication and loyalty. I now have much less responsibilities, so I can relax. \n\nNow, I'm here, with my dog, trying to decompress from my job, make more friends, actually date girls for the first time in many years of unsuccessfully trying. Things are starting to look better. \n\nHere's to better days. ",

My family knew I was struggling and they took shifts watching me. \n\nThey bought me my favorite foods, watched Ru Paul\u2019s Drag Race with me for weeks (seriously.. for some reason it was the only thing I could watch.) They listened to me cry and didn\u2019t try to give me solutions. They just said \u201cI know\u201d. We had a code word- potato.

You are a 3D terrain of whatever beautiful biome you want to be. Don't stare at a map all day and forget too look up at what it really is.\n\nEdit: holy cow, ty for medals.

For some reason, I was walking in a part of the city that was completely deserted a couple days after the outbreak.\nVery faintly I heard someone crying.

When I walked into the backyard I was fucking horrified, there was a crying little kid, like 3 years old on a leash, tied to a pole.

By comparison, I and my cohort mucked about a bit more.",

I teach elementary art and it is so nice when a kid who is pretty unskilled in art show another kid their work, and instead of getting laughed at (like when I was in school) kids are just so sweet and will say things like \"Wow, I really love that!\". I hear kids telling other kids \"I think your work is beautiful\" or \"I really like your ideas!\" and I just think of when I was in art kids made fun of my work. In general I really don't see kids being bullies as much as they were when I was a kid. I went to school in a really nice district too with few problems but I was bullied. Kids here have a MUCH worse home life than kids at my old school and while they could choose to take it out on others.. they don't. Kids help each other too. They know if a student is \"special\" and will try to help that student out. They'll offer to walk them to the bathroom, or help them with their drawing, or very politely tell them to be careful with things.",

Love those kids. \n\nEdit: A few people are doing the math. My son is 11 and I\u2019m 30.

            "***LAST AND FINAL EDIT AS OF 7/21/2019***\n\nI have now left this job after far too much bullshit, including me having to deal with constant panic attacks as well as severe depression and anxiety stemming from the constant terrible people I had to deal with every day. I have since moved on to a new job and as of me quitting on July 12th, 2019, nothing was done against this manager that I know of. I do still have friends working there (for the time being, seeing as many of us are quitting in droves) who will keep me up to date, but as of now I know nothing. Sorry to make it a lame ending with no outcome but I needed to get out of that place before I jumped off a cliff or put a bullet in my head.\n\n**ORIGINAL POST**\n\nMy office manager has a huge giant massive HR case being built against her because she's been pulling royally shady shit.\n\nLast year, some of us had been having issues with system access at my job, thankfully not me. It's a known issue and it's been getting fixed here and there, but then it rears it's head again. \n\nAnyway, about five or six months ago, a friend of mine in another department started losing access. My office manager (who is my boss' boss, she runs the whole friggin' meghilla.) tells this person to go home for the day since you don't have system access, and specifically told that it wouldn't be held against her.\n\nSo, what the hell, its not like she can do her job anyway right? She goes home. This happens about 8 more times where she comes to work and her systems don't work and she is told to go home.\n\nNow, fast forward to about two weeks before the year ended. The girl whose been being sent home gets called over by her manager and told that she has to sign a final written warning. When asked why, she is told its because she has used all her FMLA AND sick leave. She said that is not possible and asks for proof before signing the document. Her manager pulls up all the times and days it was used and, lo and behold, it was every single time she was told to go home because of system access.\n\nThis is, of course, illegal as shit. My coworker did not choose to go home, she did not choose to use her FMLA and Sick leave. My office manager DID THAT FOR HER. \n\nSo just about three weeks ago, my coworker gets called in to our office managers office and is told that she needs to give up her medical records. \n\nAlso illegal as fuck.\n\nShe declined and told her she will not do that and is still not signing the final written warning. \n\nShe then proceeded to call HR with all of this who then tells her, \"It's funny you should bring this to our attention because you're not the only one whose called us about things like this happening with her. We're building a case against her as we speak.\"\n\nShits about to go down and im fuckin here for it. I hate my job, and I've actively been looking for a new one, but part of me wants to stick around to see if they tote her ass off to jail, or the mass shitshow that will happen when she's fired.\n\nEDIT: woo boy this got blown out of proportion. I promise everyone if I\u2019m around for the aftermath, i will update somehow lol. No clue how long this case has been being built by HR and no clue how long it will take to come to fruition but if I\u2019m here for it, and it does, I\u2019ll definitely do something to update everyone whose interested lol.\n\nEDIT 2; ELECTRIC BOOGALOO-\nNothin' so far folks. I think this case might take longer to build than you or even I am thinking... Trust me when I say, I wanna see this come to fruition just as much as you guys do.\n\nEDIT 3 (4/18/19); Still nothing guys. I'm starting to think nothings going to come of it... or if it is, it's not going to be any time soon.

One of our teachers showed up with a change of her last name. It was now Mrs. Bob.

They ended up catching a homeless man climbing a tree, trying to sneak into her attic window. He had been doing this almost daily. He would wait for her to go to work, then go down stairs and help himself to food and amenities. The funny part about this story is they got to know each other throughout the ordeal, and the guy was actually very respectful, just down on his luck.

            "Before my Dad died, he once told me a story from when he was in Vietnam in the 1960s.  He told me about a mission where he and one other American with five CIDG strikers (South Vietnamese villagers turned fighters) were tasked to emplace seismic ground sensors along a trail network deep in the jungle.  He said they were about two days into the mission when he and two of the strikers split off from the main group to go watch a nearby trail intersection.  He said the jungle was pretty quite that day, just the sounds of birds and bugs and an occasional monkey.  He said they had been watching the trail intersection for about three or four hours and were deciding on whether to move further down the trail or to turn back and link up with the rest of the patrol.  Before leaving the cover of the brush my Dad said he checked the trail ahead of them one last time and prepared his men to move.  Now here is where the story gets interesting and he told this part with absolute dead seriousness.  He said just as he started to step out onto the trail he sees a light skinned Black Union Cavalry Soldier in full battle gear laying alongside the trail just shy of the intersection.  My Dad said the Union Soldier had two pistols, a Spencer rifle and a short curved club at his hip.  As my Dad was trying to process what he was seeing, the  Soldier looked directly at him and smiled.  Then the Soldier slowly placed a finger up to his lips as if to tell him to be silent and then motioned my Dad back off the trail.  My Dad said he signaled for his men to remain hidden and he recalled that as he slipped back into the jungle on one side of the trail, the Union Soldier did the same on his side of the trail.  Less than 10 seconds later he said the lead element of a group of NVA (North Vietnamese Army Soldiers) walked right through the trail intersection some 30 feet away.  My Dad estimated that the group was comprised of some 70 - 80 Soldiers equipped with automatic rifles, light machine guns and rocket propelled grenade launchers.  He has no doubt that his entire team would have been wiped out on the spot.  He said as soon as the enemy Soldiers had passed, he and his team beat feet out of there as fast and as quietly as they could and rejoined with the rest of the patrol.  He reported the enemy Soldiers his team had encountered, but decided not to say anything about the Soldier he had seen.  My Dad kept this secret for many many years; only telling me just before he passed and earlier only telling his Grandmother on her death bed in the 1970s.  He said when he told his Grandmother, she smiled and without opening her eyes told him, \u201cyou saw Old Red Tom\u201d.  Red Tom was my Great Great Grandfather.  He was a half Black / half Creek free man who was a scout for the Union Army during the Civil War and later served with the U.S. Cavalry in the American West.

        "bestcomment": [
            "Not mandatory, but there was a voluntary program like this in the US in the Depression.  It was called the Civilian Conservation Corps.  Participants got room and board, clothing, job training, and $30 a month, of which $25 had to be sent home (most were single young men, so it went to their parents & younger siblings), in exchange for working on various projects on public land throughout the country.  The reasons for it were both to provide jobs and because the Dust Bowl had opened people's eyes to the fact that the US was not a bottomless well of natural resources.  (Erosion was a big cause of the Dust Bowl, and the Dust Bowl was a factor in the Depression, so it all tied together.)  They were also called \"Roosevelt's Tree Army,\" because one of the big things they did was plant trees for erosion control.  \n\nIn my state, they built most of the state parks, a lot of them in areas that had been deforested for charcoal manufacturing and were marginal for agriculture.  You can still rent out cabins that they built, and they're great--really attractive, and shockingly inexpensive.  (I'm actually going to stay in one next week.)  Some of them have photos from the CCC days on the walls, and it's really neat to look at them and know that you're still enjoying what they worked on.  \n\nI'd definitely support a program like that today, but I think making it voluntary is (putting ethical considerations to one side) more practical--for one thing, you would have to pay participants (just like people drafted for military service get paid), and it would be very expensive if everyone did it.  Plus having it be voluntary means the number of participants can be matched the amount of meaningful work to be done, and the workers are more motivated.  With the CCC, people considered themselves lucky to be picked--$30 a month was an attractive wage, and three square meals every single day was a significant perk--so discipline was straightforward: do what you're supposed to do or get kicked out, and most people didn't want to get kicked out.  It would probably take stronger incentives to get the same level of buy-in today, but health care and student loan forgiveness would be a good start.\n\nEdit:  A number of people have asked about how you rent the cabins I mentioned.  The ones I'm familiar with are in Pennsylvania and can be reserved at https://pennsylvaniastateparks.reserveamerica.com/.  Not all cabins are CCC-built, but ones listed as \"rustic\" often are--check individual park websites for details.  (There's usually a \"stay the night\" page with information on the cabins, and sometimes a \"history\" page that will talk about CCC's role in the park.)  Rates are based on the number of beds in the cabin and start at $35 a night for cabins that sleep four; weekends and peak times are higher, and there is a surcharge if you're not a Pennsylvania resident.  The system takes reservations up to 11 months in advance--some parks fill up quickly.  Some parks allow dogs in specific designated cabins, and most parks have at least one ADA-accessible unit.   \n\nOther states and some national parks also have CCC-built cabins available for rental, but as far as I know there's no nationwide system to find out where they are.",

As a result, Facebook \"outs\" you to your family, and Grandma is typing away at all the evil Satanists trying to corrupt her grandson. And if you comment on a public post, it's unavoidable. You used to be able to control who could see your comments even on public posts by other pages, but at the same time Facebook introduced their \"tattletale\" feature, they took that ability away. Now if they were to stumble across the same page they'd be able to see your comment, but after that change, Facebook started pointing everybody you know directly to it. Not to mention, the privacy settings are difficult to find, difficult to understand, and with each passing year gives you less and less control over who sees what.\n\nBy forcibly combining everybody's social circles, Facebook is trying to generate conflict. They want to generate conflict because the conflict happens *on Facebook*, which means people logging on to Facebook more often and seeing more ads. They're essentially an internet tabloid except instead of showcasing the personal drama of celebrities for clicks and sales, they're doing it to *you* instead.

            "One time my Grandad got a sausage roll at a football match during half time, when he got back to his seat he found it was overdone, the pastry was quite burned. The man was irate. He didn't take it back straight away as the second half was about to start, but he spent much of the second half angrily lamenting his savoury snack letdown. So he takes it home, calls the customer service number on the back (I assume he had a few choice words for the poor soul on the other end but I wasn't present for this), and keeps the remainder of the sausage roll in the freezer for the next couple of weeks.\n\nSkip ahead to the next match day, my Grandad tells me we're heading out early so he can have his sausage roll replaced. The customer service line told him to go to Kiosk 3 at the front of the ground *next to* the ticket office. When we arrive, however, the shutters are down at the food place. The old man looks around growling and turning red in the face, stamps right over to window number 3 of the ticket office and slams his frozen burned sausage roll down like a fucking flaky gauntlet. At this point I'm trying to convince him the ticket office was a completely different department to the catering concession but my Grandad was having none of it. The lady working the ticket window continually attempted in vein to convince him the same, they sell match tickets not hot snacks, but this just got him angrier and angrier. Across comes a colleague behind the glass, now there's just two people to rage at. Then a head steward comes to attempt to diffuse the situation and my Grandad begins to wave the burnt sausage roll in this man's face, I was actually surprised he didn't whack him with it. At this point I'm mortified by the whole affair, wishing I'd have stayed back at the house until nearer kick off.\n\nEventually, after an hour or so, the shutters come up on the food concession. Fella at the counter goes 'You must be Mr. Alaginge' and calmly resolves the situation, dispatching a freshly baked sausage roll with the steady hands of a surgeon. My Grandad is completely satisfied with the result of his hour of insolent rage. As we're walking away he turns to me and says 'that's how you get these things sorted.'\n\n\n\n",

I've learned a ton about myself and grown as a person, and most importantly, I have seen time and time again the overwhelming kindness of the world we live in.\n\nI don't know what it is about it, but for some reason, traveling by bicycle just brings out the absolute best in everyone I meet. From the unending generosity of the people who have opened their homes to me, providing my a shower and bed, food and their wonderful company over dinner, to the drivers who saw me stopped on the side of the desolate Wyoming roads and pulled up to offer an extra water bottle when I was a million miles from a gas station's soda dispenser, everybody wants to be a positive part of my story.\n\nIn this day and age, we seem to focus way too much on the hate in the world. But thankfully, the hateful among us are nothing more than a vocal minority. I deeply believe that this world we share is a kind one, and that we all want the best for each other. And that, to me, is far more beautiful than the mountains of Montana or a sunset over the Pacific ocean.\n\nAre you ok, by the way?

That's the stuff that really gets you. The stuff you knew your loved one would have shit their pants with excitement on.\n\nMy advice for anyone going through depression. You can always die later.   You are going to die some day, the   world will make sure of it, so you don't need to take on the anxiety and   burden of ending your own life. But you can only live right now. So, why not stick around for a few decides   and see what happens? Procrastinating death is the best use of the   skill, honestly. Nobody can tell you procrastination is a negative   quality if it's what keeps you alive. It gives me comfort to know that I   don't have to be here or do this forever. It gives me comfort to know   that I don't have to take my death into my own hands. I've suffered  from  depression and crippling anxiety for about 12 years myself. And  what  keeps me going? It's the little things. I always pick something -   anything - to look forward to. A new show or movie. A new game. I follow   tennis and enjoy that. Vacations or visits from family members. Family   is everything and the little things that you like make up who you are   and no one can tell you your interests are small or worthless. Because   you like them and they make you happy and that's good enough! So just keep looking for the next   thing to look forward to, and hold on tight no matter how strong the   winds of depression become. Don't let go. You can weather the storm as long as you maintain hope that tomorrow can be better than today.",

            "Might be late to comment here but since there are very little long con ones I'll share mine.\n\nAbout 8 years ago I was living in New Zealand. About two weeks before I was to leave the country we were sitting around having our staff drinks at the bar I was working at after our shift. Some of my co-workers were talking about bad tattoos so I chimed in with \"those are not as bad as the tattoo of the groundhog I have on my ass\". Over the next two weeks I managed to talk to people one-on-one and slipped in that they would get to see it if they got me drunk enough at my going away party. Finally the day came and I got everyone who wanted to see the tattoo on one side of the room. I pull down my pants and they stare at my ass for a good ten seconds before somebody says that they cannot see a thing. I look back and say \"oh... He must have gone back into his hole\".",
            "We spent 2 months in Europe 2 summers ago and rented out the house on Airbnb to cover expenses while gone. One of the renters was a film crew that shot a documentary about a local psychopath who killed a few people. The producers needed a home setting where they could interview witnesses and people who knew the guy or victims. There are plenty of interviews of people describing the murders and how evil this person was that clearly show our living room, guest room and kitchen in the background. My wife was not involved in managing the Airbnb listing so while I mentioned the film crew to her 2 years ago she never asked what it was about and I'm sure she has absolutely no idea that this footage exists. I plan on just casually coming across the documentary on April 1st and watch it with her to see her reaction. ",

Every week, my dad would come over while she was at work and cut a tiny portion of the string off.

It was hilarious, but more than that, it was awesome to see my grandma hitting my dad after he told her.",

He's asked everyone of our friends if it's them other than me and he now shouts at the bar \"OH GREAT MY FUCKING CREEPY CLOWN IS TEXTING ME AGAIN\" any time he gets the texts.  \nI've now purchased a handful of items from Amazon like a clown nose, similar wig, make up kit and his room mates are going to leave them laying around the house where he sits on the couch or in the shared bathroom. Ultimately on April 1st we will be hanging a clown mask in his garage where they hang out after hours after the bar and we will reveal that it was me doing this.  \nHe's either going to be in tears laughing or will surely murder me.

They believed that the Old Testament god Yahweh (who they called the demiurge) not only created this universe, but that this universe is Hell due to the incomprehensible amount of suffering that constantly occurs everywhere on this planet.  \n\nBeing that this is Hell, naturally Satan is the lord of this world.  They believed that he is either an agent of Yahweh, or that Satan and Yahweh are the same being...ie, the creator of the universe is the devil, and that our spirits are trapped in an endless cycle of death and reincarnation.  \n\nThey also believed that Yahweh is an inferior being to the true God the Father, who incarnated himself as Jesus Christ in order to save humans from Yahweh/Satan's grasp by giving us *gnosis*, or intense knowledge of our predicament, so that after death instead of being tortuously reincarnated, we may finally return home to the spiritual realm from where we came.\n\nOf course in Roman times, people rebelling against the creator of the universe was an extremely subversive and dangerous idea, which is likely the real reason that the Romans put Christ to death.  People who don't submit to the creator of the universe certainly are not going to recognize the authority of any government or church, so the Gnostics were mercilessly persecuted by the Catholic Church and its governments throughout the dark ages until their ideas were almost wiped out forever.\n\nIt wasn't until 1945 that the Nag Hammandi library was discovered.  Some thoughtful soul about 1700 years ago decided to bury a lot of Gnostic texts in the desert.  It wasn't until the late 1970s that translations into English were completed, so we've really only known what the early Gnostics actually believed for a few short decades."

Both the hospital and CDC confirmed a *P. falciparum* severe malaria infection with approximately 10% parasitemia.

The patient stated that she had not traveled outside of the United States during the preceding 2 years and had no history of malaria.

She took my temperature and she instantly took me to the ER again (I had a 41\u00b0C fever).\n\nWhen we went back to the hospital I got treated immediately for inflammation and they did a wide range of test again.

My appendix was inflamed and burst the night I was having the hallucinations but on all the scans they couldn't see my appendix. The doctor told me that if I came in 2 days later I would have died because of the puss flowing in my body.

I\u2019m literally dumb struck and just kind of grin and wave (remember how I lost my phone? She didn\u2019t know that and just thought I ignored her) she waves and keeps walking. I throw like 200 shekels (way too much) in the table and sprint after her, explained and the rest is history.",

            "No sure about the odds on this one, but I survived a \u201cnon-survivable\u201d plane crush. I was on an old po-2 (famous for being very safe and uncrushable) on a tour of the desert in western China when I was like 7, my father\u2019s friend who hosted me and piloted the plane didn\u2019t survive but somehow I got out with a concussion and apparently passed out for almost a day In the middle of the dessert, in the wreckage of the crash, 50 km from the town/airport, on the edge of the desert. The people who found me were some tree planters (they plant greens in the desert to protect towns from sandstorm, a lot of people live in these desert towns in China do this) found me on there way picking up a shipment, and the only reason they looked was bc they were making a bet on how fast the egg would cook in the sand and went off the road to test. \n\nEdit:\nFirst thing first, according to legends, 15 min, I never tested it though.\nSo, according to my dads, the theory that I might have lived was because the plane was mostly made out of fabrics and wood. So when the plane crashed, the front half collapsed and took the majority of the impact. Though I got knocked out, I was probably covered under the wreckage and in the shades, it cooled me off enough to survive for a day or so! "

Also, salt the fuck out of your water! People say it should be like sea water, but those people have no idea how much salt is in sea water (it's around 1 cup of salt per gallon of water for sea water). Don't go that hard, but way more than a pinch.\n* Onion soup mix.\n* Green pepper and red pepper.\n* Garlic.\n* Olive oil.\n* Parmesan Cheese.\n\nHere's the instructions: Start the pasta water.  Chop up the peppers, cut them into long strips.  Heat a pan to a bit past medium. When hot, pour in a tablespoon or so of olive oil, then the peppers. Stir them around occasionally to cook them. At some point your pasta water is boiling (and you have added a lot of salt!) and you can cook the pasta to the box instructions.  Keep at the peppers, when they are less firm, throw in a clove of garlic (minced, I buy the pre-minced kind because I'm lazy).  Whenever you're happy with the peppers, turn them off and remove from heat.  When the pasta is done, get at least 2 cups of the water out, and then strain.\n\nIn a big bowl, pour in about 1/4 cup of your pasta water and stir in  the onion soup mix (one packet). Then pour in the pasta and the peppers. This is going to be a thick sauce, probably too thick, so add more of the pasta water until you think it's right. When it's to your liking, plate it up, and allow your guests to add as much cheese as they like.\n\nIt all takes about 20 minutes to make, and is really simple.  You can add butter or whatever if you want it creamy.  Throw in some green onions if you feel like.\n\nYou can also use onion/mushroom soup mix. That's a bit different, but you do you.\n\nEDIT: I love mushrooms to the point where I have been told I shouldn't recommend them (hence the last line not really recommending them), but I would add a shitton of mushrooms to this about halfway through the pepper cook, sliced thin. If you want the mushrooms to be more earthy, slice them thicker, or bake them really thick, but that's making the dish more involved, and I don't think OP wanted that.",

            "Force compliance on specific diets with a diverse sample of people and a well regulated control group. Follow for 10+ years. Is veganism really healthy? How about paleo? Should we never be eating gluten or dairy?\n\nEdit to add:\n\nThis has definitely not been done before because there are several problems with this kind of study\n\n\n You can\u2019t force people to comply to a diet, which is the first hurdle. You could have people voluntarily report what they eat, but this isn\u2019t a randomized trial and has its own issues. Recall issues, compliance, self selection bias, etc. You\u2019re also missing a good control group to compare results to. \n\nThen if there is a population that follows a certain diet, say people from the Mediterranean following the Mediterranean diet, you run into the problem of correlation versus causation, there could be something different about their lifestyle that is explaining the health differences besides diet. Same issue as above, no control group. \n\nThere\u2019s also the huge issue of not having a longitude study. Most short term trials examining diets are just that, short term. It\u2019s hard to ascertain if their are health effects show up 10 or 20 years down the road. \n\nAlso, people claiming that they \u201cknow\u201d what diets are healthy/unhealthy. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true of some diets/types of foods. And research non experimental data, even with it\u2019s flaws, can point us in the right direction. I\u2019d feel pretty good saying that eating more vegetables is healthier for the vast majority of people, eating Doritos is not healthy for the vast majority of people. But there is so much we don\u2019t know about optimal nutrition and how different populations react to food, I\u2019d love to see an actual high quality experiment.\n\nSecond Edit:\n\nYou can\u2019t experiment on prisoners. This seems to be a common question. Even an experiment you feel is benign is unethical. Prisoners are unable to properly consent because they, rightly, feel their liberty is at stake for consenting. They are therefore not able to consent to an experiment, which means you can\u2019t run it. Most of the laws and norms that were passed stating this were conceived after World War II when researches were quite literally concerned about preventing the crimes of the nazis from taking place again.",

            "I'm late but nobody has said it yet. The self-fulfilling prophecy studies are very important to social psychology and their findings have many real world applications.\n\nBasically they brought together a group of kids and formed a class with a real teacher. They gave the kids a test for overall academic skill at the start of the course, but didnt really use the scores. Instead they told the teachers that a few students, picked at random, were very brilliant and scores very highly. They then observed the class for a long period of time and noticed that the teachers gave the kids they thought were brilliant much more attention. At the end of the study the kids took the test again, and they found that the kids who were randomly named brilliant at the start actually scores higher than the rest of the class. The kids, again, at the start didn't score any different from the rest of the class, but through the self fulfilling prophecy they became the best in their class. \n\nThis obviously has tons of application in the world and especially education.",

One was the control, the second were told they has a lips and were doing bad, and the third was told that their speech was perfect.\n\nAs the experiment went on, group 2 began developing lisps after being berated constantly. They became shy and reserved. They were scared to speak because they didn't want to get in trouble because of their poor speaking skills. Group 3, however, had the opposite happen. They talked better, they were more willing to improve. They were encouraged to keep speaking and told that their speech was amazing and perfect.\n\nBy the end of the experiment, they had one group with no change, one group with now mentally ill children with a speech impediment, and one group with great speaking skills.\n\nIt truly shows that encouraging children is the way to go and that verbal abuse can be just as, if not more, harmful as physical abuse.",

Well they didn't buy him another one, ever.  He rode the city bus and bummed rides off of friends after that.

He had multiple speeding tickets and a DUI on record. AT 17! The DUI incident was actually a car crash that totaled his car and led to him having his jaw wired shut. So what do his parents do? They give him his license back and buy him a brand new car, which I'm pretty sure was a WRX.

After lunch we took one of our coworkers to the semi-famous Nike store which was a couple of blocks away and that was the day Justin Bieber happened to show up.\n\nWhen he and his entourage arrived he said something somewhat loudly along the lines of \"Y'all are going to have to leave for a bit 'cause I'm here to do some shopping\" and some of his people acted like they were going to try and politely force the already-present customers out of the store so Bieber could shop alone but the Nike employees even more politely told him that was not possible. At that point Bieber lost it-I mean he threw a total tantrum because they wouldn't shut down the store for him.

I guess this was the last straw for her parents because they cut her off pretty soon after that. \n\nThis actually served as a wake up call.

        "bestcomment": [
            "I worked with this one guy who had a lengthy record. He had a system for getting released if he got caught. After committing a crime, if the police were in pursuit and he knew he was about to be cornered, he would act insane. His girl would play along with it telling the police that he was off his medication. The police would arrest him but then send him to a mental ward with papers instructing the ward to release to police once he was cleared. Once he was in the mental ward, he would cause a distraction that would make the person attending the desk with the file cabinet to leave said cabinet. He would then crawl to the file cabinet, look for his \"release to police\" papers, and then would literally eat the papers. When the psych evaluators decided that he was stable enough to be released, there would be no instructions to send him to the police, and he would be released to the general public. He did this about 10 times until police officers noticed him back on the streets. This stunt forced the state to change their procedure for detaining mentally unstable suspects. ",
            "My favorite was the guy who stole a post office mailbox off the street, repainted it, and then put it next to the night deposit box at a bank. And hung an out-of-order sign on the deposit box. All the businesses came along and dropped off their deposits in the mailbox. ",
            "A guy I went to highschool had been stealing from Walmart in a pretty clever way. He would grab video games, mp3 players, beer etc. and throw them away in a trashcan in the garden section. The workers never checked the trash contents and he would just wait, sometimes 5 hours until they emptied the trash in the back dumpster and hop in to get his items. Once he took a cardboard box from a display inside, filled it with video games, a PS3, and extra controllers. He grabbed some tape and pens and drew all over the box and taped it up to make it look used and tossed it. An hour later he had a whole new PS3 and stack of games. ",

They walked in with some cheap nylon product to get one of those \"I walked in with this\" stickers they used to put on returning merchandise. The sticker easily peeled off the product undamaged. They walked to the electronics department, grabbed an expensive box off the shelf and went to Customer Service. They placed the sticker on the big box and asked if they could return the item without a receipt. \"Unfortunately, no. Not without the original receipt.\" Dang it, and they walk out. Customer service even gave the door man the thumbs up having just interacted with the customer. This took place before widespread inventory controls and cameras absolutely everywhere.",

Explains he was there working late and must have set off an alarm. \n\nThey almost believed him until he said \u201cuhh\u201d before saying the name of the company he worked for.

I issue him a warning and let him go as it\u2019s pretty common and he sang like a bird regarding the people he was trying to buy from. \n\nAnyway, the next day, I got a call from his parole officer who says he was alerted the guy was pulled over and wanted to verify that It was his guy that I stopped. I\u2019m a little confused at first but he goes on to say that the day before, he was scheduled to meet with him but he had an excuse and bailed. His excuse was that he was in the hospital. Well when he spoke with him the following day, he was able to provide documentation that he had entered the hospital day 1 and had left day 2. Well I had stopped him at 115 in the morning and after looking at the picture, it was 100% him. \n\nTurns out the guy had checked in then out of the hospital on day 1, then in and out again on day 2. He then re arranged half the paperwork to make it look like he was in the hospital overnight which would make my car stop of him appear like I mixed him up with someone else as well as give him a valid excuse to miss their meeting.\n\nNot sure what\u2019s gonna happen to that guy but I thought it was pretty clever.

            "This was in the late 90s-early 00s.\n\nA guy in my dorm came to school solely to deal drugs. He took out student loans, registered for a bunch of 300-person freshman survey courses where he would never be missed, then literally never went to class. All he did was go to raves and concerts and keggers and sell party drugs. \n\nAfter the first semester, he was suspended. He wrote the usual \u2018I was young and dumb and in over my head\u2019 sob story, and got put on probation for a semester. So he had a repeat of the fall. At the end of the year, he was kicked out, and didn\u2019t care. \n\nHe made something on the order of $150k, in return for about $8k in student loans to cover a year of housing and tuition. \n\nSo far as I know, he was never caught. It may have been a short-sighted maneuver in the long run, but in the short run it seemed fairly genius to effectively use federal loans to start your drug business. "

He got so he was covered on both arms, back and chest.  We didn't think much of it, living in Seattle, until one summer day we took him to the wading pool.  For one of the first times in public, we took his shirt off, and he strode out into the pool with his toddler abs, and Thomas the tank train shorts, looking like he had just finished a hard set of reps at the free weights in the prison yard.",
            "When my son was about two and a half, we thought it would be a good idea to start potty training him. We sat him down, talked to him explaining to him when he pees/poops in the potty he can a reward. He was less than thrilled. It was pretty clear he was not interested. We start the process of putting him on the potty, every morning, at regular intervals, etc. \nAfter 2 days, he hasn't done anything on the potty, with the added bonus of not having ANY bowel movements, at all( and this kid was REGULAR). After 4 days we begin to panic, prune juice, oatmeal, apple juice, anything to get him to poop. At day 5, we are at the Dr.s, who tells us to use suppositories. You guys we gave him suppositories for 3 nights, still nothing! Day 10 rolls around and we're thinking it's time for the hospital,he's got a blockage, he's sick, something is seriously wrong here! Take him to the Dr, one last time before the hospital. This time we see a different Dr, who looks at us and asks if we are potty training him, we shake our heads yes, wondering why it matters, since he hasn't even shit for 10 DAYS! He barely needs a diaper, let alone a potty. He kind of smiles and says, \"well, stop\". He told us that he thought that the potty training was causing him to hold his bowel movements. And that when he was ready to be potty trained, he would let us know. Sceptical, but willing to give it a shot, instead of the hospital we went back home. We made a big show of putting the potty chair up, and told him that if he pooped, he could have any toy in Target (we were desperate!) and no more potty training.......\n---20 minutes later he took the biggest shit of his little life, and we took our weary, but, relieved asses to Target to buy him his dream toy. \n---A Hotwheels Carwash. Best $29.99 we ever spent.\n---3 months later he wakes up, says \"I want to go potty like Daddy\" and has been potty trained ever since",

            "For me, it's getting things accomplished - my depression tends to come on badly when I feel overwhelmed with life. I'll make a checklist of things I need to get done - sometimes even breaking one task into 3-5 smaller, bite-sized bits. The sense of accomplishment I feel by physically marking them \"done\" makes me feel better.\n\nI also use a daily checklist for my \"bare minimums\" - it includes, take a shower, pack lunch for work tomorrow (so I don't feel guilty about wasting money at the food court or starving myself), drink water (on there 6 times = 3 bottles of water. I find checking it off after each half bottle gives me a better sense of accomplishment), take vitamins, and like 3 other things. I use an app for it, so I always have it handy and it keeps me motivated during the day.\n\nEDIT: OK, my phone has been blowing up all night \ud83d\ude02 The main app I use is Loop - Habit Tracker. It's free on Android but not available on iOS although I'm sure you can find something similar. I also use Google Calendar for EVERYTHING to stay organized, and I keep a monthly view, daily view, and task list on my phone at all times.\n\nEdit to add: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger - and the other kind redditor that also included a note! I'm hoping my experience can help some other people out today. We all go through tough times and sometimes someone else's experience can help!",

My daughter was in elementary school at the time, and she would go out of her way to introduce herself to the kids and take time to play with them. Several groups of kids came and went before we moved to another state.\nSeveral months after we moved, we were in town visiting, and bumped into the mom of one of my daughter's classmates. This mom is a child psychologist and she said, \"I just wanted you to know- I work a lot with the kids in foster care. And I kept hearing different kids talk about their friend <daughter's name>. I looked at these kids' paperwork and saw they had been placed in a home next door to where you all lived. It dawned on me that they were talking about your daughter. Just so you know, she made a lot of difference in helping these kids  recover from their trauma.\"\n\nKiddo is a freshman in high school, now, and still looks to help others. ",

This is resultant from a traumatic brain injury I sustained while snowboarding in 2000. I wasn't wearing a helmet and am lucky to be alive and not paralyzed. I broke my zygomatic arch (cheek bone), two molars, and my coronal suture (the zigzaggy part of your skull where the pieces fuse together). My eye swelled out of its socket and my brain swelled up too, and I was not expected to live and the doctors called my parents asking if I had a will made out. But I pulled through and now I live a normal life except for periodic seizures.\n\nPlease, take my experience for advice and wear a helmet when you're doing anything that could injure your head. Seizures are, in my case, very annoying and I put my family through hell worrying while I recovered.\n\nFor those who wonder what it feels like to have one of these minor seizures, it's sort of like the world \"becomes 2D\", I get a sensation similar to having to sneeze but throughout my entire body, and then I breathe heavy and get a headache, followed with feeling logy for the rest of the day. Medication helps greatly, but lack of sleep and stress can bring them on.\n\nThanks for the supportive messages. I can't wait until my little girl starts sleeping through the night!",

            "As long as the texture was close to that of actual meat, sure. I don't eat meat because I want to consume the flesh of formerly living animals. I do it because I much prefer meat to the non-meat options for getting the same nutrients and what not. If the lab-grown meat gets as cheap (and tasty) as the critter-grown meat, I see no reason not to eat it instead. Plus, it's probably less harmful to the environment than livestock farming (at a guess - I haven't really looked into its environmental impact yet).",
            "Yeah, I already have!  I like meat, but sustainability and climate change matter to me so I've cut back a lot.  I only eat the real stuff when I'm at restaurants or in my favorite special occasion foods.\n \nThere are some really good meat substitutes on the market right now.  Even if you're a diehard meat lover, you should try them out just for the novelty factor.  You might be surprised!\n\n**Impossible Burger:** Currently only available in restaurants, but it's by far the best fake beef.  The company somehow figured out how to produce hemoglobin from soy, so these burgers have a realistic \"bloody\" taste and red center.  It's not an absolutely perfect replica of beef - the texture is a little crumblier, and it's not as juicy - but in a burger with toppings you might not even notice.\n\n**Beyond Burger:** Currently available in most grocery stores at a bit under twice the price of real beef hamburger patties.  The taste isn't quite as good as the Impossible Burger, and they develop an oddly crispy exterior when cooked, but they aren't bad.  Actually, I rather liked the crispy little burnt bits.  They smell absolutely disgusting (like cat food) when \"raw,\" but once you grill them the stink goes away.  I'd recommend grilling them outside, though... the raw smell is very off-putting.\n\n**Gardein:** Their fried chicken strips (available in several flavors) are a little oily, but they have the taste and texture of a real chicken nugget.  Even my cats are fooled by these things.... after all, real chicken nuggets are so processed that they barely count as meat anyway.  The teriyaki chicken strips aren't as good as the fried stuff, so give those a pass.  The fake fish and crab balls are less convincingly \"fishy,\" but they aren't awful.\n\n**Beyond Meat Chicken Strips:**  The texture of these chicken strips is surprisingly close to real grilled chicken strips.  The taste isn't quite there yet but if you put them in a fajita you might not even notice.\n\n**No Evil Foods:**  Pricey, but their chicken and shredded pork BBQ are surprisingly realistic.  The chorizo is spongy and weird, so pass on that one.  Their Italian sausage is well spiced (a lot of vegan hot dogs/sausages taste like a damp sponge), but it tastes better sliced in a pasta dish than straight up on a hot dog roll.",
            "Sure, because they're cheaper and tasted good - I'm going to assume that they're made of something natural as well, because I lived through \"margarine\", and that was not healthy in addition to tasting like greasy shit.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the other day I ate a thing called \"I can't believe it's not General Tao\".  I could believe it was not General Tao, though I had a hard time believing it wasn't chunks of tofu.  We're a long way from meeting your \"tasted good\" condition, is what I'm saying.",
            "Do you mean, \"*Would I reduce my real-meat consumption if lab-grown meat was cheap and tasted good\"*? Because, yes, yes I would. I feel strongly that meat is really quite bad for the environment, and if we could reuce the effect that it has by replacing it with more environmentaly-friendly, cheaper replicas, I would do that in a second",

            "In 2012 I was at a nude beach in Toronto. A random 60 year old man approached me, at that time I was a shy 18 year old, and he simply would not leave. He talked on and on about how I could come live with him at his house and be his girlfriend, all the while not letting me get a word in edgewise. To escape this situation I decided to call the day a loss and leave even though I\u2019d only just arrived. As I walked back to the ferry he emerged from the trees and followed me back to the mainland. He was still planning out our lives together and offered to buy us lunch at a local bar chain. Not wanting to lure the scary dude back to my apartment I agreed in the hopes of stalling and figuring out a plan. We sat down at a table by the door and I said I had to go to the bathroom and as I passed the bar I gave the bartender, a 20-something female, the 411 on this creepy dude situation. I asked if there was a back door somewhere I could slip out of and leave without him noticing. She replied that there was one through the kitchen but it was for staff only and she couldn\u2019t help me. I felt so betrayed that another female wouldn\u2019t intervene at all and I cried a little bit in the bathroom. I was so young, new to the city and genuinely scared. I didn\u2019t even have a phone back then I was so broke. When I got back to the table the food came, I ate two bites and when he called for the check as he waited for the bill I said \u201cwell this was...\u201d and ran into the street. I figured he wouldn\u2019t ditch on the check to follow me but I still took some crazy side treks before getting on the subway. \n\nEdit: clarified sentence structure. ",

            "Now that I\u2019m an adult I realize just how wonderful my father really is. Not just in comparison to others but he is an objectively amazing father. He taught us children the hard life lessons while still protecting us. He taught us to be self sufficient and independent. He taught us to work hard and don\u2019t give up just because things get challenging. He busted his ass to make sure we got to go on vacation and experience life. He taught me to hunt, fish, and fix a car. He also taught me to garden and grow my own vegetables. How to take care of livestock and other animals with compassion. \n\nHowever, he also treated me more like a son than a daughter. I only wish that my father would\u2019ve acknowledged that I\u2019m a girl and it\u2019s okay for me to like dressing up and that it\u2019s okay to \u201cthrow like a girl\u201d. Granted, I got a full ride to college for sports and that\u2019s partly because I had to hang with the boys and my dad didn\u2019t want me to be a great female player but just a great player in general. I think he messed me up only in the sense that it\u2019s extremely difficult for me to date. I\u2019m either too intimidating to strangers or \u201cone of the boys\u201d to people I know. I think I lost my feminine side because I am so close to my dad and he was slightly dismissive of my emotional side. I had to be tough and stoic. \n\nI suppose I shouldn\u2019t complain; I just feel like if my dad were less of a hard ass and treated me more like a daughter than a son I would fit in more. Maybe be able to get a date instead of always just being a \u201cbro\u201d. That being said I am thankful for the life skills he provided and the protective eye he still has watching over his baby girl.  [26yo F]\n\n\n\nEdit: news update; got a lot of confidence from all the positivity and now I\u2019ve got a date coming up with a guy who doesn\u2019t know me or my \u201cbros\u201d and I get to make an actual first impression without being seen as one of the boys beforehand. Wish me luck! He seems kind and intelligent; I\u2019m really excited to see what happens! Even if it\u2019s a flop it\u2019s a good step out of my passive ways!",
            "My dad actually was an amazing man and I think very special as a dad. He really encouraged our independence and our want to learn about anything and everything, which i think a lot of dads forget to do. He focused a lot on education and as a result my brothers and I were reading very, very early which helped us be interested in things like the science museum and the zoo and any sort of science program on tv. \n\nHe used to just let us run crazy as kids because he knew how important it was for us to savor actually being kids. When I was little I made a mud pit in the backyard. We had a hole that our Weimaraner dug and it got filled with water so 3 year old me thought it would make the perfect mud pit. After about half an hour of playing by myself my dad came outside and saw me, naked, covered in mud, in the pit. Where other parents probably would have been pissed, he laughed and grabbed the camera. \n\nAs we got older he encouraged our independence and hobbies. For my brothers it was gaming, and thy made a lifelong career from their interest in gaming. For me it was theatre, then science, and eventually Wildlife. My dad wanted to be a biologist but never had the drive or money to finish college, so I used to teach him all about genetics and about how the phylogenetic trees of various organisms had changed. He knew a lot, but wanted to know all about how science had changed and what the new concepts were. He outfitted me with field gear and when we would go camping or hiking together, we\u2019d rock flip and look for herpetofauna. He helped me with a plant project a few years ago and that was probably the most fun we had. \n\nHe just never discouraged our interests and passions which is so important. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t really have a point anymore, I think I just needed to write this out. My dad died three weeks ago very unexpectedly and no man on earth could rival how amazing he was. He truly is responsible for our independence and wonder of the world and I think more dads need to be like him. \n\nDads: let your daughters (and sons) learn freedom. Let them explore the world and make an effort to be interested in their interests no matter how weird or dumb you think they might be. Let your kids be kids and do dumb things sometimes. Also, always let your daughter know that you have her back. Whaatever stulid decision she makes, trouble she runs into, dumb man she dates or gets involved with - you\u2019ve got her and you\u2019ll be there for her when things fall apart. My dad was so good about that. ",
            "That it's great you're extending the offer to spend time together, but when you invite your kid to the garage to help with something, actually have them help with something. \n\nFor context, my dad would be working on his boat engine or something, and he'd say come help me with this, and then I'd sit on a bucket for 20 minutes watching him in silence, and finally wander off out of boredom. Looking back, it's great he wanted to spend time with me and I appreciate that, but being present and being involved are two different things.",
            "Treating every boy interested in your daughter as your enemy does both of you a disservice.\n\nMy dad was very over-protective. Any time a boy had a crush on me, he would be immediately added to my dad's shitlist. Even if he was perfectly kind and respectful.\n\nAfter a certain point, I just stopped listening to my dad's complaints. In my eyes, he had lost the right to give input about my relationships.\n\nUnfortunately, when I was 17 I became entangled in an abusive relationship. \n\nMy dad hated the guy. But since he also hated every one of my previous suitors, I didn't interpret his concerns as legitimate. \n\nOn top of that: since he was so busy trying to *prevent* me from having relationships, he never talked to me about what a healthy relationship looks like.",

Encourage open communication about relationships, dating, respect etc. If your daughter is afraid you're going to be \"waiting on the porch with a shotgun\" or you're going to \"read the riot act\" to whomever they bring home, they are more likely to sneak around behind your back.\n\nEDIT: it's not the threat of physical harm that is the issue (most people would likely agree they've heard of version of this and laughed it off as a joke). It's the sense of doubt that it creates in young women. The feeling that they are not capable of making good decisions on their own when it comes to the relationships they choose to persue. We keeps preaching that we want our daughters to feel empowered to make their own choices. It starts by removing the need for them to choose partners that meet your \"approval\". Instead, empower them by teaching them how to navigate relationships, have the tough and uncomfortable conversations - let them make a few \"bad decisions\" so they can appreciate and identify what healthy male interaction looks like.\n\n My dad is a great guy! He just said the things that \"dad's were supposed to say\" 20+ years ago.  It always made me uncomfortable, but I didn't know how to express myself.

            "Not me but my dad. He got remarried after being divorced for about 5 years. I would have been all for it, but he met this woman in another state on a business trip, and would travel up to see her every weekend after they hit if off. They knew each other for 6 months before getting engaged. The engagement was only for 3 months. My brother and I tried telling him about all the red flags, telling him to take his time. My dad is very well-off financially, and we kept trying to earn him things were moving too quickly, that she was only in it for the money. She moved her whole family from their home town to the city my dad lived in, including their elderly grandmother who needed constant medical supervision. Before they were even married, the pantry was full of Whole Foods brand food instead of the local grocery store, as was tradition. All new furniture, and had the house repainted, all at his bride-to-be's request.\n\nThe marriage lasted all of 2 weeks. Apparently my dad's new bride had the gall to ask my dad to leave everything to her in the will, and write me and my brother out. Only then did he realize she was in it for the money. The next day he had the marriage annulled. \n\nSomeday I would like to know what it's like to fall so completely for someone that I don't recognize they are taking advantage of me.

            "Back in the early 1980\u2019s, I spent 6 years in the US Navy. In 1986 I was recruited to go into the US Army through a program for technical and intelligence experienced military personnel to become Warrant Officers. All the Navy offered me was sea duty and more sea duty. It looked like a real good deal.\n\nI was engaged to a young lady three years my junior and had a bit more than $20,000 in savings. Everything looked promising with a new career and family life. The wedding went off without a hitch.  I was looking at a vacation of about 3 months between exiting the Navy and entering training for the Army. \n\nIt was when my recruiter contacted me over my security clearance that things went south.  My credit report did not match my questionnaire. There was three credit cards with a $14,000 balance I didn\u2019t mention. It was no big deal, they weren\u2019t delinquent, but I needed to amend my answers to account for them.  \n\nTurns out my wife had opened up a charge card at our bank, then got a couple of store cards around town. She had purchased some serious clothes and jewelry, but the real kicker was she had bought a horse.  She had taken lessons as a child and decided this was going to be her new thing. There was the price of the animal, riding gear, saddle and tack, vet bills, stable fees, yadda yadda yadda.  I ended up dumping a big chunk of my savings into paying down these cards, then amending my questionnaire responses. \n\nShe was from a very blue collar family. They were very good people who worked hard for everything they had. But I don\u2019t think, credit ratings and compounded interest rates were much discussed at the dinner table. So I explained about credit cards, the huge interest rate, how long it would take to pay one down, then about security clearances and having a huge debt with no job would affect it. \n\nI treated this all as a bump in our relationship, but thing got dark really fast.  My ship date was coming up and things had to be done before I started training.  I was in good physical shape, but I was facing Boot camp, AIT, Airborne school, ranger school, warrant officer selection and advance training... basically 18 months of utter insanity.  I was prepared for what I faced, but there was a lot that could go wrong.  If I got through it, I was a Warrant Officer. But if I dropped the ball along the way, I would not only be enlisted, but junior enlisted in a job they would decide for me.  In theory, I could end up a line cook in some chow hall at Camp NoWhere. \n\nAbout a week later, the phone rings. It\u2019s about the horse. No one was taking care of the animal or cleaning the stable, or even feeding the poor thing.  The stable had covered down for the sake of the animal, but now were charging $350 a week for the extra services my wife was supposed to be doing.  She was leaving our apartment every day, and I assumed it was for riding and care of the animal, and for the first week she was. The second week, she was lawyer shopping. She wanted out. She must have gotten wind of what happened at the stable and didn\u2019t come home that night. The next day I got served with papers.\n\nTotal marriage time; 47 days.\n\nSo I ended up with an apartment with four months on the lease, no car and a horse. I found a new home for the horse. I had to defer my ship date and it took 14 months to settle the divorce.  My security clearance was approved two days after the papers were filed. I shipped the next day. \n\nIn the end, I had two pair of pants, three shirts and a pair of shoe that had no business on anyones feet.  I was working 2 minimum wage jobs, 14 hours a day, paying down debt, lawyers fees, rent and sometimes eating to get by.  \n\nI ended up at Fort Sill, Oklahoma mowing lawns for two months as I shipped without a training slot for boot camp.   I wasn\u2019t happy, but I was relieved. \n\nIn Airborne school, I met a ROTC cadet who was going to Airborne school over her summer break. She had a year to go before her commission and we hit it off. We\u2019d get together on holidays, between training, long weekends. When I finished training and got my warrant, still a cadet, she flew across the country to give me my first salute. I gave her a silver dollar as per tradition. Two months later, she received her commission, to which I saluted her, and returned the silver dollar. Married that Christmas.\n\nWe\u2019ve been together 31 years.",

My client had gone on a bit of a shoplifting spree and we were cleaning all her cases up with a global plea (meaning we handled them all at once). \n\nBeing new, I filled out the plea form wrong swapping the counts she was charged with for the counts she was pleading to. It\u2019s an easy mistake to make. Every court has their own unique form and I was unfamiliar with San Mateo\u2019s. \n\nThe judge calls my line, starts reading off the plea form, notices the mistake and then starts screaming at the top of his lungs \u201cCOUNSEL! WHAT IS THIS?! WHAT IS THIS?! IS THIS YOUR FIRST DAY ON THE JOB? THIS IS A COURT IF LAW AND WE DO NOT ACCEPT MISTAKES! FILL THIS PLEA FORM OIT CORRECTLY OR I WILL HAVE YOU TAKEN INTO CUSTODY FOR CONTEMPT!\u201d  \n\nI did not expect a reaction like that. My client, who had clearly just taken a huge bong rip at 8 AM and who was wearing an all-pink velvet track suit was looking at me like I was the biggest idiot in the world. \n\nI corrected the plea form. The judge made me wait until the very end of the calendar to take my plea. Afterward, he called me up to the bench. In private he told me, \u201cSorry to ream you like that. Everyone messes the plea form up so I always pick the youngest lawyer to yell at. The older guys will grumble and complain, but if you noticed they all fixed their own forms and we didn\u2019t have any more problems. Keeps the calendar running smooth. Where did you go to law school?\u201d After that he invited me into his office for coffee and gave me some really good life/work advice. Turns out he likes talking to new lawyers. \n\nTl;dr: Judge losses his shit in court over a simple mistake, turns out it was all a show for the other lawyers and I have one of the worst/best court experiences of my early career. ",
            "Represented a woman charged with multiple very serious felonies. She insisted that in the months before the offense, she\u2019d been seriously dating one of the detectives who ultimately wound up investigating and testifying in her case.  For a variety of reasons, I trusted this client and believed her, even though the detective never disclosed the relationship in his report.\n\nSo, during his testimony, I ask \u201cDetective Smith, you had a romantic relationship with Ms. Defendant, correct?\u201d He goes \u201cWhat? No!\u201d and is visibly offended. The judge Iooks at me like I\u2019ve lost my mind, the commonwealth attorney audibly says \u201cwhat?\u201d, I\u2019m freaking out because a large part of my cross and argument was focused on the bias formed by the prior relationship, and now I\u2019ve got nothing and I\u2019ve lost all credibility.\n\nI try again, \u201cDetective Smith, have you had a sexual relationship with Ms. Defendant?\u201d.  As the Commonwealth rises to object and the Judge starts to scold me, the detective goes \u201cOh, yea. We\u2019ve had sex, it just wasn\u2019t very...romantic.\u201d\n\nEdit/Update: State is Virginia. The jury acquitted my client of the relatively minor charge that the detective in my story was involved with, but convicted of the other, much more serious charges that detective had nothing to do with. There was a confession and video on the serious charges, so it was kind of a no-brainer. Sorry I'm being kind of intentionally vague, there are no confidentiality concerns (since this all happened in open court), but its distasteful to give out too much information about a client. \n\nThe detective was not \"disqualified\", his testimony was not thrown out. Impeachment, no matter how good, doesn't result in you getting to throw out a witness's testimony entirely. By the way, it wasn't really the sex that was the issue, it was that he didn't disclose it to anyone and his repeated insistence under questioning that he didn't disclose it because it was irrelevant. Like Watergate, its not the crime, its the coverup that gets you. But I don't get to demand the judge throw out the testimony or that charge just because the cop failed to disclose a prior relationship with the defendant. I just get to point it out, argue it in closing, and then hope the jury also sees the relevance. ",
            "UK - Bear with me on this one. I was in court listening to the most boring old defence lawyer you\u2019ve ever seen, he was questioning the arresting officer in the case. It was drugs or something like that.\n\nAnyway, he\u2019s droning on about every little detail and the magistrate was constantly telling him to hurry along. The arresting officer was getting noticeably annoyed and the room became empty pretty quick. Everyone was very bored and annoyed. He was droning about details that I\u2019m not sure anyone was really listening to or cared about.\n\nAnyway, he went over arrest times and the likes with the officer, time he admitted the suspect and released him. He had bored the officer to the point were he was barely paying attention. \n\n\u201cSo he was admitted in at 21:45 on the night in question...?\u201d \n\u201cYes\u201d \n\u201c...and released the night after...\u201d \n\u201cyes\u201d \n\u201c...and that was what?

Nothing shook him or got a rise out of him, and he was an expert at figuring out what he wanted to say in the most neutral fashion possible before he said it (conversations with him took forever because there was a pause before every sentence).  \n\nBut then.  BUT THEN. This guy poisons an entire jury pool of 75 people.  We had to individually question each person to see if that little outburst was going to affect their impartiality, etc.  75 in camera interviews later, judge pulls the guy back in in front of everybody and begins to SCREAM at him about disrespecting him, the courts, and every other juror's time.  Me, the attorneys, and the court reporter go white faced because we didn't know this was coming.  \n\nThe guy didn't have to sit for jury duty, but I still don't know if he got to pick his kids up, since he spent a couple days in jail for contempt.",
            "I was involved in a pretty messy custody case. The other party was a mess and had kept the child from my client for a few weeks. OP was playing lots of stupid games and kept requesting continuances. I requested a drug test, which the judge ordered. However, the OP didn\u2019t show up for it (to clarify, he did show up, he just stood in front of the toilet for literally 2 hours and claimed he couldn\u2019t pee). I was representing the plaintiff so the burden was on me. I called multiple witnesses that testified to the defendant\u2019s drug use. So, opposing counsel decides to call their client for direct examination and asks, \u201cyou don\u2019t use heroin  and crack, right?\u201d That is, for the non-lawyers, a very stupid question for many reasons. Especially considering his client didn\u2019t show up for his drug test. However, I fully expected the defendant to just lie and say he was clean. After the question was asked, there was a really long pause and the defendant said, \u201cyes, I do both of those drugs.\u201d My head almost exploded. I didn\u2019t ask any questions on cross examination because I didn\u2019t want to muddy the waters. I won, and the child is doing great. "

            "A common misconception about being gay is that the awareness of being gay is any different than the awareness of being straight.\n\nHere's how I know I'm straight (I'm a guy).  At a certain age, I started feeling differently around girls.  I liked to look at them in a certain way.  I liked to hear their voices, and to be around them.  I liked to dance with them and hold their hands.  I liked to kiss them and hug them, and talk on the phone to them well into the night.  In \"serious\" relationships, I would feel like there just wasn't enough time, because we each had to go to our respective homes, instead of just staying up all night and talking, which was all we wanted to do.\n\nEventually I learned that this was what it was like to be straight.  But I never thought of it as being straight.  It was just how I was.\n\nMy son is gay.  And all I can hope is that he has the opportunity to feel the same things while he's young as I did at his age.  And I don't care who he feels that way about, nearly as much as some people think I should.",
            "Here's an actual answer: http://www.bentvoices.org/bentvoices/feinstein-blindandgay.htm\n\nEdit: The whole story is worth a read, but here is a relevant bit:\n\n> I knew that I was very different from the other kids, and I felt horribly lonely. I didn't fit in with the sighted kids, but what was worse, I didn't fit in with the blind kids, either. All the boys were interested in sports and rough games. I wasn't. Some talked about girls, but because I was blind from birth, and because nobody ever talked to me about sex, I had no idea what was being discussed. I am ashamed to say that I didn't even know the difference between girls and boys, except that girls were usually nicer to me, and yet, I felt a strange feeling when hugging a male student.\n\n>When I was 15 years old, a girl explained to me how babies were born. \"You're very stupid!\" Harriet told me. \"Your father stuck his penis in your mother's hole, and that's how you were born. Don't you know anything?\" I wanted to ask more questions. Where was this hole? What was all this talk about \"hard-ons\" and \"erections?\" But I knew that if I admitted how little I knew, I'd be laughed at, so I kept quiet. I could not ask my mother. She never talked about such things, and I knew she would only be upset and tell me not to ask so many questions. So, I ordered books in braille about sex, and read them, and had a vague understanding.\n\n>What is surprising, and very important, is that I began to realize that I was attracted to other boys and men, and not to women. I realized that I had a strange feeling when close to people of my own sex that I did not have when I was with women. I somehow knew that this was not the way it should be, and never mentioned it to anyone. ",

So if you find yourself in a group situation where someone (a leader, tutor, manager etc) is asking questions that must be answered and you want to avoid being picked so that you don't have to talk, then here is my tip.  If the person locks eyes on you as they ask the question, then just as they are about get to the end of their question you break eye contact and look towards another person in the room and hold it.  Their attention is diverted to that other person just as the question ends and the person they are now looking at feels compelled to answer.  If however the person starts asking the question while looking at someone else then look at that other person and hold it so you can't get suckered.  Use it sparingly because if you do it enough on the same person, they will be on to you.  ",

I struggled to keep a neutral face and not gag.  \n  \nI tried to place a blood pressure cuff on her arm and her skin just started flaking off in my hands. I gagged. The dr. started removing her clothes to examine her. Her feet were black to the ankles. Her hip bones were poking through her skin and were black. The skin around her ribs was worn away to oozing muscle fibers. Her calves were incredibly swollen and the skin was splitting like ripped pants. I removed her Depends, and there was feces coating her entire genital area. Then the dr. went to remove a large bandage on her lower back. Her entire sacrum was exposed and the bones were BLACK! The skin around it was a black liquified mass.  It smelled like nothing I\u2019ve ever smelled. I can\u2019t even describe it. The dr. Told her family I would clean up her ulcers and wounds in preparation for surgery (liar, no surgeon would operate on her).  \n  \nI had no idea how to clean dead bone tissue and liquified skin (they don\u2019t cover that in nursing school). When I went to clean her sacral area, all the liquified skin separated and oozed all over the bed.

I have done mostly family medicine, some surgery in my early days, but decided to mix life up a bit.\n\nThe hospital was typical third world - a few basic medications, rudimentary clinical tools, a small lab on site which was usually broken. No resuscitation tools whatsoever. HIV, TB and malaria was rife - it would not be uncommon to encounter a death per day despite our best efforts.\n\nOn one of my first days there an unconscious person was carried in by a mob of locals. I could smell him before I saw him because he had been in a house fire and his skin was cooked - completely black around his chest, face and over his legs. \n\nHe was still breathing on his own and maintaining his airway but we had no doubt he had inhaled a lot of smoke. With no way to intubate or provide oxygen we merely had to hope that he didn\u2019t swell up and close off, and deal with the rest of the burns while he was unconscious.\n\nTwo colleagues who worked in the hospital cane over urgently. We all kept our cool externally and got the nurses to translate to the man\u2019s family that we were going to do everything we could to get him better. In reality all three of us knew his chances at survival were in the single digit percentages.\n\nWe decided that due to the extent of his burns we were going to have to do an escharatomy (cutting the burned skin to prevent it contracting and stopping him from breathing). Turns out I had the most surgical experience so despite having never done one before I gave it a go, hoping for the best.\n\nWe got an IV into a neck vein and got fluids going. The local nurses dressed his burns. We gave him whatever pain relief we had.\n\nHe was unconscious for a couple of days but eventually came to. Each day we were expecting his kidneys to pack up but to our surprise, gradually he got better. He was with us for just over 4 months recovering.

            "I don't know if life gets better or *you* get better.\n\n\n\n\nI've struggled with depression for most of my life. The thing is that my mental toils grow stronger with every other struggle I have to deal with. Summers used to make me extremely happy (well, content is maybe a better word) because I could only be focused on work and making money. College was horrible because it took almost six years and the only thing I envisioned my diploma to be was a giant question mark instead of a marker of success. I was tired, angry and overwhelmed for those six years. I thought about killing myself a couple times because of all the strain. But I thought that if I killed myself, I wouldn't have known if I'd have finished school. *But school was so difficult to complete*. Your whole life you hear that a degree brings happiness and success. It doesn't...but school is done with.\n\n\n\nDo I have a career to show for it? A nice new car and a house? No. I have debt but at the same time I'm carefree. So to answer your question, depression might not go away but *you* will mature and things will get easier. But it's never truly gone.",

            "I'm late so this will probably get buried. In 2008 I lost my job. All I could get right away was McDonald's so I took it, but it wasn't enough to pay all my bills. My car was repossessed, I got kicked out of my apartment, and I found out my girlfriend was cheating on me all within the space of a month or so. It was the lowest period of my life. I struggled with depression, considered suicide, it just wasn't a good time. I was homeless, but I had good friends who gave me a place to stay so I was never actually on the streets. It took awhile, but today I have a good job, I apprenticed in the tool and die trade and I make good money for a guy who barely graduated high school and never went to college. I'm married, and my home life is stable. It's not perfect, life never is, but I'm far better than I was.

I'm glad so many people found this inspiring.",
            "I saw some of these mentioned in other comments, but I'm just going to make a list. A previous employer chose to see my mental health and my work performance as \"two separate issues,\" which led to the worst panic attack I've ever experienced and a case of burnout that I'm still wrestling with \\~3 years later...so a lot of these things come from what I had to fight through over those years:\n\n* Counseling/Therapy. Professionally is probably best, but you also have to \"shop around\" for a therapist you work well with, sometimes. Barring that, I'd try talking to a family member or very close friend, someone you know you can talk to anything about, even if it's just to vent. I live alone, but I have a dog (service dog in training); I've resorted to talking to her a few times, and even that has helped.\n* Don't let yourself sit at home all day. I know full well I can only speak for myself, but I was always amazed at how the simple act of walking through the door suddenly lifted a huge weight off my chest, put a little spring in my step, and made it that much easier to just...be more like my old self. Hang out with friends, keep devoting whatever time you can to your hobbies/interests, just go for a walk to clear your head. Even just a few minutes at a time is better than not at all.\n* Take time to reflect. This has always been an invaluable tool for me (again, I hope it's just as useful for you), and as I've recovered from various bouts of anxiety, depression, and whatever else I've dealt with over the years the insight I seem to gain as I improve has helped me learn more from these experiences than I would have if I had just said \"Oh good, I'm on the road to recovery\" and pushed the bad stuff out of my head on the spot.\n* Try to find things in your life you have full control over. Are they good things? Awesome! Keep them that way, or make them even more awesome if you can. Are they not so good things? Do what you can to mitigate the bad and make them better, or just get rid of them if there isn't another option.\n\nI can't think of anything else at the moment, and I truly wish I could. I was also in a...horribly toxic relationship for most of the last 3 years, and I feel like everything else I'm coming up with is too specific to just that circumstance and all the insanity that goes with it. Or specific to other things I'm trying to deal with that I brought upon myself when things were at their worst for me. But know that you're not alone in dealing with this stuff (as cliche as that line is). Please feel free to drop me a DM if you want/need someone to talk to, or even just to listen.\n\nEdit: Welp, this blew up when I wasn't looking! Thank you everyone who left comments. I figured it would be easier if I just made an edit to touch on a few key things:\n\n1. What I shared are things that have helped me over the years. I do not expect them all to work just as well for others as they do for me, I'm painfully aware of how drastically the effectiveness of any one thing can vary from person to person. Even if my suggestions don't work for someone else, maybe they can at least lead others to a similar trick or habit that *does* work for them.\n2. In most cases, a therapist is supposed to be a professional you go to for help, yes. I was not trying to insinuate otherwise when I also suggested family or close friends; I have been incredibly lucky to have a lot of friends that made the effort to reach out to me periodically, make sure I was still surviving however I had to, and remind me that I can always talk to them about whatever, whether it's to vent or seek additional opinions. I've been even luckier that the therapist I've been working with for several years now actually is something like a friend, as well. After all the therapists I've worked with in my life that didn't help at all (or made things worse), I count my lucky stars, and I hope that others can find someone like that as well.\n3. The previous employer thing...this is a bit of a long story. In my mind, it's only the first chapter of the story, because from that point up until now I've just been endlessly trying to get back on my feet, and I've only started actually holding onto the progress I make within the last couple of months or so. But basically, I started having a harder and harder time keeping up with work and an increasing number of things going on outside of work. I thought I'd be able to get back on track again right around the first time my boss expressed concern for my performance at work, and within a week my father called me while I was at work to basically say \"Hey, I might have cancer, I'll keep you posted, love you, bye!\" and leave me with nothing else to go on for the better part of a month. Next chance I got, I told my boss about what had happened, only to have him respond with, \"Yeah, I'm still concerned about your performance...\" So I went to HR and told them about the mental health issues that had come back after over a decade. I told my boss the same thing, so everyone knew what was going on and everything I was doing to get back on track again.\n\nTwo weeks later, I had an annual performance review (I knew it wasn't going to be good, but I figured they'd at least cut me some slack given everything else). I was hit with a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan), which gave me 30 days to get myself up to where they wanted me to be. They could fire me at any point in that 30-day window if they thought I wasn't gonna reach that level of performance, and even if I did there was another provision that said if my performance started waning again they could still fire me on the spot without another warning because of the PIP on my record. That was when I asked about the mental health conversation and they made the \"two separate issues\" argument. Their head of HR even claimed that that was true under the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), which my doctors all scratched their heads at because by their understanding the opposite was true.\n\nI went back to my desk, and for a half hour I just sat there, staring at my monitors. I don't even remember any other symptoms of a panic attack (racing heart, pounding heartbeat, etc.) because I was too distracted by how I could only see colors. I couldn't even make out shapes, just blobs of color that were all blending together. It still scares me to this day when I think about it and what it was like.\n\nI think that a case of burnout started then, if it hadn't in the weeks leading up to that...made the anxiety and depression that much harder to cope with, because writing code - what I had loved to do for work and for fun - now made me physically lock up every time I tried to do it.\n\n...And now I know I need to be done with this edit; my doggo just hopped up into my lap and got comfy in a way that made it a bit harder to type. Yes, she will get a treat for doing this. :3\n\nEdit 2: Aaaaand my first ever Reddit gold! Thank you very much, kind Internet stranger!\n\nEdit 3: And thank you for the silver, friendly Internet spirit of kindness!",
            "Everything in life is temporary. Good times, bad times. All temporary. But if you were happy you would never think to yourself, wow this happiness is gonna last forever and will never change! \n\nWhen depressed we have a tendency to think nothing will ever change. But this is the source of the depression. \n\nYou need to abandon the narratives you've created for yourself. You aren't some weirdo who is screwed up. Most people in your situation would likely become depressed. Hence why its endemic and suicide is the biggest killer of young men. \n\nYou are just a normal person. You're not the problem. It's our sick shitty world. You're just reacting appropriately to it. \n\nIt will changed for me when I started to view my depression and anxiety as non-narratively. They weren't a sign of weakness or failure. It was an underlying functional problem with my biology and thinking. It wasn't anything to be ashamed about. Indeed, it's not an emotion inducing event. Depression like all disease is morally neutral. \n\nRisk factors of depression aren't things like \"bad personality\" or \"boring\" or \"dumb\". Risk factors for depression are things like lack of  physical activty, poor diet, genetics. None are statements about you as a person. \n\nIt took years, but slowly I changed how I thought. I did some great cognitive behavioural therapy. I started to become aware of the thoughts that went through my head, and aware of how those thoughts would trigger negative emotion. By simply observing and discarding those thoughts I can stop tormenting myself. \n\nThe biggest thing you can do, is be kind to yourself. Give yourself a break. You're going through a really tough time. My rule when self talking is never say anything to myself I wouldn't say to a friend. I am a friend to myself. I take care of myself. I don't tell myself im pathetic for this or that anymore. \n\nAnother thing I really remember my therapist saying - Act don't feel. If you wait until you feel like going out to a coffee shop, you will never go. The act of going is what will make you feel better. Lack of activity is strongly linked to depression. It's why anxiety often leads to deprssion, your brain wants to act, but you are too afraid. So you do nothing. And that act of thinking about doing something and then not doing it, sends bad signals. Humans want to be free and have agency. \n\nIt's a long road, but you need to learn to love yourself. You're worth it. We all are. We're not weak because of this shit. \n\nAnd one day this rough patch in life will become your armor. Everytime life gets rough I remind myself its a cakewalk compared to the shit I've been through. Literally nothing can hurt me anymore really.",
            "Go to therapy/counseling. The other suggestions are great but I don't think these people understand what it's like to go through depression. You don't merely \"snap out of it\" by doing the things they suggested. Find a good therapist and if you cannot afford one, look for support groups of others who are also experiencing depression and talk about your struggles with them. Mental Health Counseling, along with the things the others have mentioned, will go a long way.",
            "I agree with a lot of the previously stated advice. If your loneliness and depression are connected, I agree that therapy or counseling would be a good move.\n\nIn addition to that, you can also re-frame your alone time. Not all activities have to be done socially. I don't have a lot of friends and never have. One of the things that I really enjoy is going camping or backpacking. It feels really good to be out in nature in a place where being alone isn't a bad thing. \n\nI garden. It felt really good to pick and eat a blackberry from a plant that I'd taken care of since it was a tiny little seedling.\n\nI also just respond to a lot of things on Reddit. Unless your name is your screen name, no one knows who you and never will. There's a Subreddit for pretty much everything, so much so that I sometime make a joke of it and type in [reddit.com/r/](https://reddit.com/r/)(insert random 2-3 word phrase) and more than likely it'll pop up as an existing Reddit. You can connect with people who don't know who you are, don't care, and still accept you. Think of some books or TV shows that you like, find a Subreddit for them, and comment away. I heard once that \"people are only normal until you get to know them,\" and Reddit's a great place to find fellow weirdos.\n\nIt's also nice to spoil yourself once in a while. I do this from time to time with cooking when my wife is out of town because I'm a little more adventurous an eater and cook than she is. Made coq au vin from scratch (I mean, I bought the chicken from the store, I didn't raise it from an egg and slaughter it myself). Took me like three hours to prep and cook from beginning to end but it tasted badass and I'm worth spending three hours on. \n\nI have three dogs and will stop and say hit to every other dog I meet. Always been more of a dog person than a people person anyway. But it's really comforting how a dog that doesn't know a thing about me will still wag his tail if I come up to say hi. Dogs are simple and awesome that way.\n\nI'm posting comment #96 on this thread, so keep in mind that you're not really alone.",
            "Relationships happen because you have a life to share. So don't go looking for it. Build a life for yourself first.\n\nSelf improvement. Exercise, nutrition. Get a plant or pet and bond with it so you have some form of responsibility and a reason to become more disciplined. Once you've sorted out the basics. Find what would make you happy or proud of yourself and actively chase down that dream.\n\nSometimes it helps to remember that you could put yourself in an absolute hell if you left things deteriorate. So spend a bit of time contemplating how easily things could get way worse if you did nothing. Just dont ever forget: you have something to contribute to life. Even if others cannot or do not appreciate what you are doing.\n\nEvery small step helps! Give it time.\n\nAs a last piece of advise: Do a year of yes. If someone asks you to do something and you cannot immediatly think of a proper argument to say no. Say yes and go do it.",

The objective was to discredit Ed Muskie, the early democratic front runner who was destroying Nixon in the polls. Nixon wanted to run against McGovern, a far-left fringe democratic who was essentially unelectable. Muskie\u2019s campaign limo driver was a Nixon plant and who was leaking intel from overheard conversations.

That is just stupid",
            "Its worth noting that in the US, this has been tried/proposed several times in several jurisdictions and courts toss it out.  This is a *massive* simplification (bc the full explanation is super complicated), but in the US punishments must be clearly delineated (eg not arbitrary) in the statute and based on the crime itself, not on the perpetrator her/himself.  And to be clear - a judge has discretion to waive/reduce/etc due to hardship, but it really doesn't work the other way (eg, a judge can give you the 'max' but s/he can't just arbitrarily tack on a punishment higher that the statute permits b/c you are rich.)\n\nEDIT to add: getting way too many replies to answer ppl, but here is something to think about: The 8th amendment plus the 14th amendment together prohibit punishments that are 'arbitrary.'  This means that when you are punished for a crime, there has to be a set penalty in place. This means that if two people commit the *exact* same crime under the *exact* same circumstance in the *exact* same jurisdiction, they would get the *exact* same punishment.  If a punishment was based on your income, you'd get two different outcomes - this is why these laws get tossed.  There's a famous quote I'm butchering that goes something like 'justice can never be served by the roll of the dice,' meaning different outcome for different people in identical situations isn't justice.\n\nAnother thing to consider - your income itself is *also* arbitrary.  On monday you're unemployed; the next day you take your last dollar and win the lottery; if you got a ticket monday, the punishment is $0 on tuesday your punishment is $$$$$ - with no change in the law itself; that's too arbitrary in the eyes of the law.  There are also several other challenges in the way of income-based fines, but the 8th plus 14th amendments are the big ones.\n\nFinal edit: there's a ton of \"but in Germany...\" or \"but in finland...\"  or \"if it works in Europe, it can work here.\" Other countries can do whatever they want; in the US we are bound by the US Constitution - there's not a lot of wiggle room short of 1) passing an amendment, or 2) pushing through a whole new interpretation of several amendments and getting a whole shit load of precedent reversed.  Good luck with that.",

            "I'm probably going to be in the minority here, but no, I think it's a bad idea... Or at least not a great idea.\n\n1. People should, at least in theory, should be equal before the law. The context in which the illegal action takes place should be a factor (stealing bread to feed your starving child, vs stealing bread from a starving child for fun.) but it's a dangerous road to go down to punish one person more than another for nothing other than who they are.\n\n2. In general terms, harsher sentences don't deter crime, for the most part, most of the time. Hopefully I made that soft enough to avoid one off counter examples....\n\n3. The income thing is a little more complex than you might think. Is it your tax return from last year? What if you made a lot last year, but are unemployed this year. What if you make no money but your spouse/parents etc are rich? Do we look at wealth or just income? Numerous other problems\n\nEdit: credit to u/Blueshirt38 below for the idea, but:\n\n4. Local police may disproportionately target rich people (ie nice cars) in order to genate more income. Some people might think that's a good thing, but the roads are less safe when that happens.\n\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nMany of the objections to my point, I think can be reasonably summarized as the following:\n\n\"We agree that law should be applied equally, however the effect of the law is unequal and the real world effect is that poor people are punished more harshly for the same crime, because the fine represents a larger proportion of their net work. That is inherently unfair.\"\n\nThat's a reasonable argument, and it comes down to the same general idea as the old equality of oppotunity vs equality of outcome argument.\n\nAllow me to give some counterfactuals in the same vien:\n\nA healthy 20 year old person and 70 year old person both commit the same crime. The expected life span is 80 years. The young person is expected to have 60 more years to live, so they should receive a 30 year sentence (50% of the life they are expected to have left) , and the old person has less time left, so they should receive a 5 year sentence.\n\nA rich person and a poor person walk into a store. They both want to buy the same item. The poor person offers 10$ and the rich person offers 20$. The store owner must accept the 10$ payment because it is a greater percentage of the poor persons net worth.\n\nA talented successful person with a loving family and a loner with nothing going on in their life both commit the same crime. The jail time affects the person with the family more, so they should receive a shorter sentence, because the jail time affects them harder. \n\nIn all of these examples we are trying to correct for unfairness by various metrics, and applying legal and economic force to \"correct it\" in ways that hopefully look weird to you. \n\nHopefully that articulates how I feel about the fairness factor, and that I don't hate poor people. I am poor and I hate myself, but I don't hate other people.",
            "I would feel poorly about a percentage-based system for several reasons:\n\n1. Many wealthy people, particularly those who are self-employed, often actually draw a very low annual income for tax purposes. Some would actually wind up benefiting from a percentage-based system.\n\n2. It would be difficult to predict what the annual intake would be based on such a system. There is a risk of that annual intake significantly decreasing and leaving the relevant government and/or public departments with much less funding.\n\n3. From a more practical perspective, wealthy individuals will just hire lawyers to dispute those tickets anyway. It's an area of the law with a depressingly high success rate in most jurisdictions.",

Please stack your fridge appropriately so cross contamination doesn't happen. Veggies and fruit on top, also eggs is fine, beef, fish, poultry. Chicken juice will contaminate raw veggies so quick.\n\n5. You don't need a fuckin knife block. I'm a chef for a living, I butcher 10-20 ducks a week and I have 6 knives? Even that is just cause I'm very particular. Your average home chef needs 3 at most. A standard lengths chef knife, a paring knife, which most home chefs never use from what I've seen, and I medium size blade for veggies can be nice.\n\n6. Label and date when you open stuff and keep it near the front. Keeping it near the front is most important as it helps encourage you to remember, \"Ah yes, I have this kale that I should use\" before you open something else.\n\n7. Olive Oil can go bad, lots of people think it can't, but it can.\n\n8. Canned stuff isn't the worst, just mix it with fresh stuff \n\n9. Diversify what ingredients you're using. Most Americans and Europeans cook with the same 20 things? Every time you go to the grocery store pick up a new ingredient and try it out! Beets? Amazing. Like mushrooms? Try oyster mushrooms instead of generic shiitakes. Like onions? Grab a leek. Seriously, CHANGE IT UP.\n\n10. wading in to more professional territory but try some Fermentation.

            "I was driving home after an extremely late night at work, I lived in the middle of nowhere, about a mile before I got there a woman covered in blood jumped out of the woods into the middle of the road screaming. I panicked and went around her then slammed on the breaks to help. Her boyfriend had beaten her and was currently chasing after her in the woods. I got her in my car and called the police, they met us at the hospital because I told them there was no way I was waiting on the side of the road when he was coming.",
            "Went on a mountain hike in Transylvania with a group of friends from school, and way up, after maybe 12-14 km of trekking, we saw a house....was in the middle of nowhere. It had a barn, with a few animals, couple of cows, chicken, etc. As we get closer, we see a few people, a guy and 5-6 women. Not sure if there were more inside. The dude comes to greet us, barely speaking the language. We had a hard time understanding what he's saying. They lived without electricity, gas, anything. This is in the early 90s, so there's no internet, mobile phones to worry about. At least for most people.\n\nAnyway, they all looked weird, kinda dumb expressions on their face, we can barely understand eachother. They asked us who's the president now, and if we want some milk. They look at our clothes and shoes weirdly, curious...like who knows when is the last time they had human contact. Or maybe there were more crazies around those parts...dunno. Not sure to this day what was going on. It's not typical in the region, so we kinda freaked out, especially cause the dude looked a bit disturbed, and we were too young. We were looking around to see if there's more of them, paranoia was getting to us, thinking there must be a village nearby. What was also weird is that all the women kept their distance, and never got close to us. Like he was guarding them, or checking us out, if it's safe for them.\n\nOne of my friends kept saying we don't want their milk, and we need to go, cause it's getting dark. We walked calmly for a while, then when we thought we're out of their sight, bolted like crazy out of there. Needless to say, we camped after a few hours, and we always had one person awake to keep watch.\n\nWe told people that were living in the villages near that area, about the \"mountain people\", and they didn't believe us. They said nobody lives there, up in the mountains.",
            "A little over 18 years ago I had just gotten out of the military. I drove all the way from Louisiana to my home town in Montana, without incident. \n\nI spent a few days at home and then got back on the road because my new home destination was Boise Idaho. It was February so instead of going straight down the length of the state I cut across the panhandle of Idaho into Washington. The highway going straight down through the state is really twisty and very dangerous in the winter. \n\nSo I crossed the state line into Washington. It was a Sunday  and it was very very early in the morning. As cliche as it sounds there was quite a bit of fog in the air. I had been driving for a while and I really had to use the bathroom. Now normally given how I was out in the middle of nowhere I would normally just pulled over on the side and took a whizz but since it was so foggy and hard to see I thought it safer to just wait until I hit the next small town. \n\nSo I drove for maybe 5 more miles and I started seeing signs for a town. I can't remember for the life of me the name of the town but I think it was Linden or Linder something like that. It was on I90 going into the Spokane valley \nSo I head towards the sign which was a right turn off the interstate and its a short drive up this road and I reached the town. It was small but I thought nothing of it since I was from a small town in Montana. \n\nNow here is where things get odd. \nThere was not a single person to be found. There were cars and business but not a single person to be found no one walking the street no logging trucks driving everything was just as still as the air. I stopped at a gas station. It was one of those 1 in all places that did car repair tires etc, but no one was at the counter. \nI thought well maybe it's just really early. So I went around to the side to see if the bathroom was locked and it was. As I made my way back around to the front of the building saw a delivery truck it was a coke classic truck. Except it wasn't moving its head lights were on the hazard lights were on and the passenger and driver side doors were open  just sitting there in the middle of the street. Yes I was getting a bad vibe so I got back in my car and went back the way I came I got back to i90 and thought again about just pissing on the side of the road but honestly I was too afraid. I continued driving until I hit Spokane honestly I was more than a bit freaked out and had completely forgotten I had to piss. \n\nI didnt see anything creepy or hear anything creepy but the stillness in the air and the complete lack of life human or animal was just terrifying and unsettling. \nI looked on the map to where I was once I got to Spokane which was a rand McNally's map (because GPS on phones was just not a thing yet) and I could not find it at all on the map even as I was writing this I looked at Google maps and nothing by the name Linden Linder or otherwise is on the map. I still to this day will never forget that feeling of just freaky displacement I felt there. \n\nWhen I got to Boise I told my friend about it and he thought I was just trying to rip off silent hill or resident evil and honestly I can't blame people for saying that but  at the same time that was the reason I wouldnt piss on the side of the road. I kept recalling the part in RE 1 where the hikers were killed by the murderous dogs. \n\nAnyway if you stuck around this long thanks for reading and if you know of a town on hwy 2 between Coeur d'lene Idaho and Spokane Washington people let me know. If you are from there I mean no offense but your town is creepy as fuck.\n\n\nEdit: I have to correct myself after going back over my trip I didnt stay on hwy 2 I actually jumped on  i90 and then went over to Spokane. \n\nLast couple of days I have been thinking about this and I have a 3 day weekend coming up maybe I will take a road trip up to northern Idaho and see if I can find this place again. Maybe I'm tempting fate here but its gonna he my 37th birthday so here's  to adventure !",
            "Doing urban exploration in a dilapidated church at night, on one of the floors was this circular motif in the floor where i guess a podium or something was. There was fresh blood on it as if something was killed there. When we went in the basement later on, we heard someone running upstairs. I'll see if i can find a picture of it, if it's in my tower pc i probably won't be able to for a while though since it's fried.\n\nEdit: [Found it](https://preview.redd.it/myhpfxk1qr431.jpg?width=1024&auto=webp&s=6a3ed8cbc9eb6056fe89dadfc36747cbfc8abb38)",
            "When I was really young, we were on a family trip and me and my older brother took a ride on a boat. I remember my mom telling us to avoid the \"big floating thing\". She thought it was a buoy to signalize a dangerous rock under water or something. Being kids, of course we went straight there to explore it. So turns out it was not a buoy. That was a body of a turist that went missing a week ago, as the police informed us a few days later. Creepy thing is he was one of a group of people that had disappeared together. I believe they never find the rest.\nSo, not a good childhood memory.",
            "Not sure if this is the kind of story you\u2019re looking for, but it\u2019s a fun one to tell so here you go. \n\nI used to work in low income home weatherization, basically giving free shit away to help lower electricity and gas bills and make the home more comfortable to people who really needed it; installing doors and insulation and so forth. \n\nOne step in qualifying a home is testing combustion appliances to make sure they\u2019re not emitting carbon monoxide into the living space, because if they are and we seal up the house we could kill the whole family. \n\nDuring a pre-inspection of a home on the outskirts of the city, I ask to see the owner\u2019s water heater. He tells me that it\u2019s in the basement, which is fairly normal, and I tell him I have to inspect it before work can start. So, he goes into the kitchen and starts moving the refrigerator. Turns out the entry into the basement is underneath carpeting beneath the fridge. I should note that I went and did thousands of homes over the years, and had never seen such a thing.\n\nBut, whatever, needs to be done regardless and so I pull out my flashlight and shine it down the stairs, to check out the layout but really to look for black widow spiders because fuck black widows. At this point I notice a dead cat, mostly down to a skeleton. Not my favorite sight but really common in crawlspaces and basements. I take a few steps down the stairs and continue my spider check, and notice another couple of small animal skeletons. \n\nAt this point I start to worry about gas, or poisons, or something equally dangerous, and start looking closer. There are animal skeletons everywhere, at least ten on a cursory look. Some of them are so degraded I can\u2019t determine what they used to be. I also happen to notice that this guy is waiting at the entrance a little too quietly, with his hand on the door. \n\nSomething clicks in my brain and I get this immense sense of danger. I\u2019m about four steps from the door being clear to close, I have no partner on the job with me, there\u2019s death all around me, and I realize just how hidden the entrance to the basement really was.\n\nI noped the fuck out, told the guy I needed extra tools and would be back, and marked the job as non-feasible for health and safety as I was driving away. I have no idea if I was actually in any danger, it could have been completely innocent; but I still remember the adrenaline rush and sense of doom, and sometimes you just don\u2019t take chances.\n\nEdit: obligatory \u201coh my god, first gold ever!\u201d Thanks, kind stranger!\n\nAlso edit: I\u2019m getting asked frequently if I reported this guy to the police, and there\u2019s a lot of concern about the dead animals. I did not file a formal report, mainly because nothing I saw was entirely out of the ordinary. Crawlspaces and basements have venting at the base of the house, and it\u2019s really common for animals to squeeze in and then not be able to get back out.  If you have space under your house there\u2019s a decent chance something has died down there. You get used to it when your job takes you down there frequently. \n\nNow, this was an extreme case and clearly everything put together raised concern enough for me to get the fuck out, but the sad fact of working with low income families is that you see how lousy their lives can be. You learn not to do anything to make their lives any harder, and I took a lot of pride from the fact that my job made their lives just a bit better. I didn\u2019t think that my being scared for a minute was enough to involve the police, you know?",
            "I was driving through rural parts of Missouri with a buddy. We drove down a single lane road that had no exit. At the end of the road, there was a group of deer corpses laid in a perfect circle. I'd say there was at least 10 deer.\n\nWe BTFO real quick.\n\nEdit: spelling",
            "Found a deer with its hind end ate up, few feet away was a coyote with the hind end ate up, then another few feet away a fox with its hind end ate up. Nothing else was there, no bullet holes or signs of a arrow or anything else. Couldn't find any tracks from other people or animal. It was pretty creepy. Found in the hills of WV.",
            "I'd been at football training with a few of my cousins when I was about 10 years old.\n\nWe decided to take a walk before our parents picked us up, so we went along the canal towpath. My cousin looked down in the canal and say a really nice jacket floating along and being a weird scavenger person decided to reach in to fish it out.\n\nWell, the jacket turned over. And so did the man wearing it. He also had no face left. \n\nNot gonna lie, that was rough.",
            "This is probably less scary than a lot of the other posts but I was pretty sure I was going to be the nameless victim at the start of a horror movie to show how dangerous the monster is.\n\nBasically, my dad and I were walking through the woods when we came across a young moose leg lying on the ground. It looked like it had been violently torn off with no sign of the rest of the moose anywhere. It was fresh with blood still on the wound probably no more than a couple hours old.\n \nMy dad is a pretty skilled hunter so he handed me his axe that he was carrying and told me to watch for wolves while he started looking for tracks. After a little bit he came back saying \n\n\u201cthat\u2019s weird, normally if it was wolves you\u2019d be able to find paw prints but I can\u2019t see any. Also no bear prints so I have no idea what killed this\u201d\n\nAnd so I\u2019m like you didn\u2019t find any tracks at all?\n\nAnd his very reassuring response was \u201cwell I did find what appears to be the mama moose tracks headed this way\u201d showing me the tracks \u201cyou can see how her stride is a lot longer here, whatever killed her baby she didn\u2019t want to fight it she just took off running\u201d\n\nHe then pulls out his bear spray and holds it at the ready as we kept walking deeper into the woods with the un-named non-track leaving predator armed with bear spray and an axe."

But upon arrival they will tell us \"I never said I had chest pain\" Yet we ring and ask for a transcript of the conversation and there it is.\n\n9/10 times we have to take them into hospital to check they're okay just incase there is any heart or lung issues, but people will lie to get things seen quicker through the emergency pathway. But people will get us out for anything because they can't be bothered to: A) Drive themselves, B) Pay for a taxi, C) get public transport or D) wait too see their GP (Family doctor)\n\nYou can leave people at home and tell them you won't take them but if they ring back another crew will be sent out or even worse something bad could actually happen and you're stuck with the liability.\n\nIt makes me so annoyed people see it as a taxi and not as an emergency service. But let me clarify this is a small amount of people but they're definitely there.\n\n\n\nEDIT:  (My personal opinion) For all those saying \"This is why things shouldn't be free\" This is a minority of people who do this, all of my patients are treat with dignity and respect, I've had people who've come off motorbikes, attempted suicide, heart attacks, pulled muscles, chest infections the works. I know each and every one of them no matter how dire the circumstances will be treat fairly and equally for their condition with a care plan to look after them after they leave hospital.\n\nThe NHS has saved my life and countless others and takes a small sum out of my taxes at the end of the month without the worry that I need too fork out for insurance.\n\nFrom all the comments for American and other EMS colleagues from around the globe (you guys are rocking it by the way, keep up the stellar work) the situation is similar in their work, people just don't pay as a result your insurance premiums go up and to pay the difference, in the end everyone pays for everyone else.\n\n\nEdit Edit: IMPORTANT: please don't let this put you off calling an ambulance, if you are genuinely worried about yours or someone's health call us up, we'd rather arrive and find it was nothing than be called when you're at your worst. \nJust give us some snacks, Yeah.\n\nThanks for the gold!

We had a deadline coming up in a couple months and they over-promised to the client and then asked us all to work extra hard to meet the deadline, and asked us to work 50+ hour weeks.  Which we did - and then some: some of us put in 70-80 hour weeks to meet this deadline.\n\nBut once that deadline was met, suddenly there was another deadline they needed to meet.  And another.  People got tired, had lives to lead, and scaled back on their hours.  Most of us were still working 50-60 hours a week, but not a lot more than that.\n\nOnce they realised we weren't killing ourselves on their project any longer, there was an All Hands meeting where the managers told us that they were incredibly disappointed in our lack of professionalism because so comparatively few employees were now working more than fifty hours a week.\n\nOne of our harder workers stood up and said, \"Look, I have three kids.  I'm driving an hour into and out of work every day, I'm taking care of my family, I'm trying to get presents for Christmas, write out Christmas cards, decorate and clean the house for everyone we're having over for the holidays - I'm having a really hard time just getting to fifty.\"\n\nAnd the manager looked at her and sneered, \"If it wasn't Christmas, it'd be because it's Easter, or Memorial Day, or because it's summer and it's nice out.  You'd always have some *excuse*.\"\n\nThere was dead silence in the room.\n\nWhen we left that meeting, we didn't talk to each other, but every single worker on that project put in exactly fifty hours a week after that.\n\nThen came Christmas - raise and bonus time!  Every worker on the project got a 1/2 percent raise; the managers got a five-figure bonus.  We were *pissed*.\n\nFor management, the pain came after Christmas.  First week off the year, four programmers had better jobs lined up and quit.  Three more the following week. Five the next.  We hemorrhaged 3-5 programmers every single week for over three months.  It got to the point where the managers had to schedule a meeting every Monday at eleven to discuss that week's resignations and rearrange the surviving staff.\n\nFuck CSC.",

            "There are some researchers who have been collecting and quantifying the data of Near Death Experiences (NDEs) for years now. They have created 6 categories/stages of NDEs that generally sum up most experiences. \n\n1. The hellish experience. It can be either a mildly uncomfortable experience, a cold, dark, damp, loveless experience, or the traditional flames and devil experience. Sometimes say they are drawn out of this realm by an indescribable love. Very few people recount experiencing this.\n2. There is another type of experience where one has an out-of-body perspective, and can travel freely. Often times this happens in an operation room where one's heart has stopped and the doctors are working to revive the patient. The individual many be able to go to other rooms in the hospital, or travel across the country. If they remain in the hospital room, they do not always recognize their own bodies on the table, and can feel confused. (quick note: there have been a surge in NDEs since the 1960s when resuscitation techniques became more advanced.)\n3. Much like many of the other redditor's comments, there is another experience of blissful, warm darkness that just feels comfortable. It is indescribable nothingness, often without memory or any inkling of consciousness at all.\n4. The next experience is similar to the last, but with an additional light that is usually far away, that emanates warmth and love and forgiveness. The individual is either attracted to this light and goes toward it (or the light itself comes to the person.) It allegedly gets better and better the closer one draws to the light, and so they continue. (Obviously this is where the phrase \"go/don't go to the light\" likely comes from. \n5. This experience continues where the last leaves off, where the person has broken through the light (to the other side). They now are experiencing a love/compassion/forgiveness/state of consciousness that is unlike anything they can put into words. Sometimes they encounter a sort of guide (this could be a loving anonymous being, or a religious figure (if they experience this, it is sometimes linked to their beliefs on Earth, but not always.)) This experience is sometimes accompanied by the most beautiful music. This being may present them to loved ones, or show them a life review (this is a very common experience of those who have had NDEs.) It may be at this point where the NDEer decides, or is told to return to their body (there is sometimes a choice) because they have \"work left to accomplish in their lives.\" And I put that last part in quotes because of how many people cite that as their reasons on coming back.\n6. The final experience goes beyond the previous state of love and consciousness and is experienced only by a relatively few  people compared to the previous others. They say that they experience a becoming one with the universe/universal energy that unites everything/God. They have stated that they understand everything; that knowledge is known just by thinking of a topic. \n\n(Disclaimer: people have different words to describe all these experiences, but what they typically agree on is that words themselves can not come close to explaining their encounter, for all of the aforementioned NDEs.) Most experiences are overwhelmingly pleasant, they lose fear of death, and they cannot wait to return to this state. However they know they must wait. \n\nThe NDE's that I've looked into pretty much all fall into these categories, so I'd like to hear any others that might not. As you can tell, this interests me greatly!\n\nI want to end this by saying that if you wind up researching NDEs, come to your own conclusions about them. Is there a reason for someone to be pushing a certain belief on you? I have confidence that what people say about their NDE's, they themselves wholly believe to be true. Whether or not you do is up to your own judgement. There are people who make videos and give talks about NDEs they supposedly experience, but to me some seem to be fake and over rehearsed. Take what you want from my spiel, and if you have any questions about this, I've done a fair share of looking into the topic, and would love to discuss further. If you want any directions on where to look first into gaining your own knowledge of NDE's, I can definitely help you find something. Your NDE plug, out. ",

            "My girlfriend is anaphylactic, and it is triggered by a chemical called salicylate (found in pretty much every food). When she was in high school she had her first big reaction, and the school nurses refused to administer her epipen (adrenaline shot) until the ambulance got there. Now obviously, having an anaphylactic reaction doesn\u2019t give you a lot of \u2018waiting time\u2019, so by the time the ambulance got to her school she was in pretty bad shape and barely conscious. The paramedics immediately administered one of her epipens, called the nurses \u201cfucking twats\u201d and loaded her into the ambulance as her mother arrived. She continued to fade, so they gave her a direct injection of adrenaline this time, still nothing. They give her a second direct injection of adrenaline and this time it hits her about 30 seconds later all at once, and her heart fails. She stops breathing, no pulse, nothing. Dead to the world. For about 2 minutes and 46 seconds she was clinically dead. And the scariest thing is, she saw nothing. She tells me that when you are losing consciousness you can\u2019t tell the difference between waves of drowsiness and when your body actually shuts down. All she saw was the darkness of her eyelids, and it felt like going into an extremely calm sleep where she couldn\u2019t hear or feel anything, and she didn\u2019t mind it. All despite the fact her mother and the paramedics were screaming at her to keep her eyes open and the ambulance was flying towards the hospital. She miraculously just came back to life almost 3 minutes later as they were giving her chest compressions, and the cardiologist that assessed her later stated that all the adrenaline in her body was enough to not only stop her heart, but to also restart it with the little help from the paramedic pumping it around. But still do this day, she can\u2019t differentiate falling asleep after a long day, and dying.",

They got their tests back, had a day to review them, and were allowed to re-submit for a regrade. They knew he was cheating because of the unlikelihood of the grading mistakes on multiple exams but the TAs who graded it couldn't confidently say it wasn't their handwriting.\n\nUltimately it was an office worker for the department who figured it out near the end of the semester, his staples were angled different than the exams handed out that were mass stapled. He was recreating the test, printing it, re-answering it, and then grading it in the same pen as the TAs and had done a good job copying the writing style.",

However, they used a program where once you entered the test your entire screen was locked into the test and the only way to exit it was to click the finish button on the test or turn off your computer which effectively did the same thing. Another feature of the program was that once you were in the test, anything you had in your clipboard (copied text) was not able to be pasted into the answer sections on the test to prevent the only other way to cheat. However, after creating my own classroom at home , making fake tests and playing with the program to figure out a way to cheat I realized that it would allow you to copy things from inside the test and paste them elsewhere in this test. The developers of the program also did not take into account the sign in screen where you have to find the test and enter it. \n\nLong story short, I could copy my entire page of notes I had taken on the test material, paste it into the section where I would enter my login information. Then recopy it, enter the test and paste it again in one of the answer sections, using it to answer every question and then deleting it before clicking 'finish'.  ",

Was about to send out a stack of dimsum when I looked at the ticket again with a note that said \"no peanuts on the tempura tofu\".  \n\nI had read it earlier and didn't sprinkle peanuts on it.  Another server was about to run it to the table when I told him to wait and get the actual server for the table.  We were slammed and he was kinda pissed but went and got him.  The actual server comes back and he's all frustrated when I ask him \"Does your 'no peanuts' guy not like peanuts or is he allergic to them?\"  Server responds with \"he's very allergic to them, that's why I put no peanuts on the ticket!\"  He was all being shitty with me.  I told him \"well the fucking tempura tofu is fried in fucking peanut oil!\"  \n\nDidn't realize the head chef was behind me and heard the whole thing.  Server didn't know we only used peanut oil.

            "My cousin was born deaf and went through an operation to recover part of his hearing when he was 12. He sometimes uses hearing aids but can get by without them in general.\n\nHis family had a bunny, Tupu. Of course he had learned about cows mooing, cats meowing etc. before he had his surgery. He was very shocked when he came home and greeted his bunny that it made no sound. It took the longest time for him to understand that bunnies are pretty quiet animals in general.\n\nHe explained he thought all pets were loud.",
            "My old roomate in NYC got implants at... I think he was 25 or 26... he was shocked that the radiators in the house didn't make noise... he could feel them, and was absolutely sure, given their shaking and vibrating from time to time, that they were going to be quite noisy.\n\nOn the flipside, he was deeply annoyed by the buzz of fluorescent lighting, which he did not expect to make noise.",
            "I had a child friend that gained hearing and she didn't realise you could control the volume of your voice.\n\nSo when I whispered to hear she said, hang on I think I need to adjust my hearing aid.  At first I just thought oh it mustn't be working, until I realised what was going on. She whispered to me for about two weeks solid just to practice :D :D :D\n\nYes she also practiced shouting, but we did that in secluded woodlands.",
            "Well, after the cochlear implant, I started hearing a lot of things that I never knew existed.But, here are a few things I thought would make a noise, but NOPE. (edit to clarify this)\n\n1. I expected the light bulbs to hiss or flickering sound when you turn them on. I was so disappointed.\n2. I thought you could hear your eyes close, \"blink\" but there is no sound when you close your eye lids. No whoosh.\n3. You know how wind makes a noise going through trees? I thought it would make more noises going through hair. Nope.\n4. Now I could hear soft sounds, but I still get spooked when I see a bug crawling, and I don't hear it. They don't make a noise. at. all.\n5. Pooping does not make a sound, only the splash into the toilet. I thought the body makes a noise to push it out. I was disappointed.",

            "So my dad was born Deaf and got a cochlear implant in his late 30\u2019s. He has since passed away so I can\u2019t ask him this question directly but a related story:\n\n\nWhen I was a newborn, my dad was holding me and my mom (who is hearing) was in the kitchen. My dad rushed into the kitchen with me and asked what I was saying because my mouth was moving, and my mom had to explain babies couldn\u2019t talk until they were much bigger. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing how limited your perception can be if you aren\u2019t surrounded by people who can communicate with you. Unfortunately he didn\u2019t learn how to sign until he was a young adult as well so his formative years were basically without language (see below; he and his mother created a very basic language to identify objects/some actions but that\u2019s all).\n\nWhen he first heard sound, he didn\u2019t understand it and it wasn\u2019t what he expected. In response to someone clapping and asking if his implant was working after waking from surgery, he said no it wasn\u2019t working (it was), and that it felt like movement in his head.\n\nEdited for more information: He grew up in communist eastern Europe where any kind of sign language was outlawed. He and his mother created their own primitive and secret sign language and he knew very little of his native European language. Children with disabilities were sent to live in boarding skills where they were taught trade skills. However, those with disabilities were heavily discriminated against under communism as adults so he fled to another European country as a refugee (alone, without his family who helped him escape, at the age of 18) and lived in a refugee camp before coming to the USA through the help of a charity service. He learned ASL when he moved to the US through a volunteer service. The US provided him with opportunities he never would have had otherwise.",

Got my hearing back around 8 years old through surgery. \n\nI used to think traffic lights made noise. Street signs, too. Like when a stop sign has a blinking light for added visibility. I think that's actually where I got the idea in my head. They're trying to get your attention, right? So of course they must put sirens in all the traffic lights. My mom says I used to hold my ears when we'd drive through an intersection, though I don't remember that part.",
            "not me, my good friend who\u2019s hard of hearing told me about how before he got hearing aids, he thought that all fridges made a beeping sound (like an alarm) when you open them so the house knows when you\u2019re getting something \n\nturns out his mom just told him that to stop him from eating all their snacks"

Here's a list of the stupid shit he did that I can name off the top of my head:\n\n-During a music class where we had a work period for some project, he asked the teacher if he could go make up a test he had missed earlier that week for a different class. The teacher said yes. He left the room, went into the band's instrument storage room, took a nap, then got really pissed at the teacher for not letting him make up the test. \n\n-In the same music class, we had to use GarageBand to create a soundtrack for something, and there were some guidelines we had to follow. Instead of following the guidelines, this kid just filled the timeline with random loops, admitted to doing that, then tried to argue with the teacher about his grade for the project (20%). \n\n-Tried to become a Soundcloud rapper. He recorded his mixtape in the school bathroom, then deleted it about 3 weeks later because everyone made fun of him for it. The only line I actually remember was from a diss track where he said \"roasted in a pan of ovens\". \n\n-Started fights with 4 different people and got his ass kicked 3 times. The one guy who didn't beat him up was 2 years younger, 6 in/15 cm shorter, and probably about 80 lbs/36 kg lighter. One fight was started because someone made an incest joke about him and his cousin, one was because someone made fun of him for the previously mentioned line from his mixtape, one was because someone was calling him by his rapper name (his initials), which apparently was disrespectful because the other guy didn't know his middle name, and one was because he was flirting with a girl who already had a boyfriend. \n\n-Bragged about getting his very own tractor, but refused to show anyone any pictures of it. A few weeks later, someone finally convinced him to show pictures. It was a fucking lawnmower. \n\n-Got caught watching porn during class on his school laptop, responded by punching it and breaking the screen.\n\n-Tried out for the baseball team one year, couldn't go back for a fly ball without falling on his ass, missed every pitch during batting practice, and got mad at the coach for not letting him on the team.",

            "I was about 9 years old, and my mom said we were going on a camping trip. I didn't really suspect anything, as it was summertime and we went camping a lot when I was younger. Although I did wonder why we were packing so much stuff. After a few weeks of \"camping,\" I started to complain, but my mom kept insisting that it was good for us to get in touch with nature, etc. Then school started, and we were still camping. And we kept camping for another 6 months. When we finally got a house, my mom cried with joy. And we don't camp anymore.",
            "I was 13 when my parents kicked me out and told me they no longer wanted anything to do with me. I was terrified to visit a shelter because I'd known some foster kids and the whole system scared me plus I wanted to continue going to the same school. In didn't want to lose my friends too. The scariest part at that age was really finding out what I was hoping to eat. There had been a dilapidated trailer just minutes down the road from my dad's place so I stayed in that. \n\nI don't think it all really hit me until I had to choose one night between food and blankets because the temperature was expected to drop down to the mid 30s and I had only had one somewhat thin blanket at that point. The next day, I put on my best attire which was nothing impressive and asked for a job at Long John Silvers. I lied and told them I was 15 and I worked 5 days a week rushing over after school.\n\nI ate more unhealthy than I have since to save money for some form of shelter which came in the form of a 91 Toyota Camry that I purchased out of the Thrifty Nickel for $300. I loved that clunker plus heating myself was much easier. \n\nFrom there it was mostly uphill. Found an older lady willing to rent me her garage without any sort of credit check. Took a couch off the side of the road to sleep on. I even had internet in there where I mostly read scary stories all night (I wish video streaming services were really a thing back then) and I just kinda... Learned to roll with the punches. My childhood wasn't normal. It was downright terrifying a good chunk of the time but it is what made me who I am today",
            "I remember being really hungry and acting weird because of the low blood sugar, almost delirious. This was when I made a futile attempt to run away from an abusive home with no money. I ended up going back because of that.",
            "I was homeless for a couple of months a year or two ago. I had a car and a low paying job so I lived in the woods in a tent for a bit. The first night was miserable. I ended up sleeping really uncomfortably in the passenger seat of my car and it was a really cold night. After that I got a tent and slept on an old climbing pad i had. The first night was hell but the next several weeks were actually not so bad. I had a spot in the woods where I was well hidden and would cook over a fire.\nI really didnt have it that bad but it gave me quite a bit of sympathy for people who really do end up on the streets in a much more desperate situation. Shit is not easy.",
            "I was only homeless for about six weeks, at 36 years of age. After several years of depression and anxiety slowly eroding my resources, relationships and general will to try anymore, I ended up having a final blowout with my gf, who reasonably couldn\u2019t handle me anymore.\n\nI started sleeping at work, which wasn\u2019t even a full-time job.\n\nThe delicacy involved in not getting caught, and the freedom from the extremely unhealthy state my relationship had been in, kept my mind away from the absolute, abject terror that was hiding beneath the surface; the scary part of homelessness for me was the growing sense that if I fell any further I\u2019d probably never get back up. It takes resources to be clean, fed and rested, and if you aren\u2019t those things it\u2019s very hard to get resources, let alone find the will to try. But that first night was all triage, all focused on being sure the second night wasn\u2019t going to be on the street.\n\nI pulled it off for six weeks, and that time, actually, saved my life; I was away from conflict,  intimately connected to how dire my circumstances had become, forced into a very regular schedule (routine is *really* good for me but nigh-impossible in a depressive state), and, without bills, was able to save enough for damage-deposit and rent.\n\nI still struggle with depression in a pretty serious way but the animal terror of having no where and no one really seared itself into me. A better motivation would be the-future-i-want than the-future-i-fear, but as it stands I at least have a motivator strong enough to escape the incredible gravity of mental illness.",
            "Sleeping in my car wasn't that bad. It was summer, so it was pretty warm which was my biggest issue. \n\nShowered in the gym, and spent most of my day at the library before going to work. \n\nFor the first few nights it wasn't bad. However one night police found me sleeping in my car and escorted me to the local homeless shelter, which was one of the most terrifying nights of my life. Since I'm lying there in a top bunk, when a huge argument breaks out because one guy breaks out some meth, wouldn't share it with a second, then a third got pissed and started screaming at them to be quite because he needed to sleep.\n\nEdit: since this is coming up a lot, people keep asking how it was legal that the police escorted me to the shelter. I don't know the legality of the issue, what I can say is that I was woken up by a knock on my window to see four cops, two cop cars, they were singing those super bright flashlights through my window at me, and I didn't even think of arguing with them.",
            "When you're a teenager it seems kind of cool to sleep in the car, on the couch or floor of a friend or acquaintance, or for your dad to scam a rented apartment for a month or two without paying for it. Moving around every few months carrying everything that you can in an old Honda Civic seems like an adventure. We once moved a couch across town in it. We must have looked like a couple of idiots.\n\nOnce after a few months of staying in a place where we had no furniture, were sleeping on the floor, the carpet of which was so flea-infested that you could literally see the fleas hopping around, the landlord got so frustrated with us basically squatting in his property (my dad promised to pay and never did) that he removed the front door.  So we went out to scam some food from somewhere and came back to find no front door. Which in retrospect is a pretty awesome way to get someone out of your property.\n\nOne of the ways we scammed food would be to go to the breakfast buffet of a fancy hotel, tell the server that we had a room there, eat a ton of food and just walk out. This was also kind of fun but looking back it is a kind of fucked up way for a dad to treat his teenage kid.",
            "I was kicked out by my mother at 16 and spent 2 months homeless before the local authority placed me in foster care.\n\nI think what hit me first was how my own mother could make one of her own children homeless. I felt like the least favourite of her children - it all came out of nowhere, I racked my brain for years after, trying to think of what I might have done in particular.\n\nAlso the crippling loneliness you feel when you are trying to get hold of people to ask for a place to sleep for the night. I could not feel more alone in the world when someone would either not answer my message or tell me they were busy.\n\nI'm pretty sure I camped out in the park that night. Didn't sleep at all.",
            " Slept in my vehicle, couch surfed with a friend, squatted in an unused trailer; all while still working at a Walmart. Saved enough to get a crappy apartment and just kept going from there.",
            "First night my wife and I landed up sleeping outside we slept in a local park that I knew. We had come down from the countryside with a few Rands (enough for 1 meal maybe) and had hoped to stay with a friend. He was unable to give us a place to stay, so we had to sleep outside.\n\nAfter the insecurity of that 1st night I told my wife that we have to find a safer place to sleep, so we climbed up the slopes of Table Mountain (about a 1 hour walk) and found quite a obscured spot amongst some bushes and trees. We cleared it out of sticks and rocks, made it a bit habitable and then went make to the city looking for work. We'd spend the day going from one place to the next looking for work until it started growing dark. Then we'd head up the mountain to our little spot for the night.\n\nDid that daily for a month until we were able to secure a small shack room in the townships, where we stayed for another few months until I get a job offer.\n\n\nWas my wife's temp waitering jobs that kept us fed whilst I was looking for work.\n\nBiggest challenge was mental, keeping focussed, clean, looking presentable and just making my job looking for a job."

It just called to me, so I went in and picked it up. I checked the first page for the cost and guess what? $10 - perfect.\n\nSo come the day of the secret santa, we were all opening our gifts, some 150 people. Out of the corner of my eye I see some people crowding around a woman who is crying. I keep listening and people are calling out for the person who was her santa. I go over and reveal that it was me.\n\nThe lady I had bought for was crying and hugged me. She said 10 years ago her house burned down along with all her of possessions. The book that I bought her, was her favourite and also the exact same edition so had the exact same cover she remembered. \n\nBecause it was a second hand book it was even weathered in the same places she remembered, so it was as if I'd grabbed the book off her shelf before the fire and delivered it to her 10 years later.",

But instead of getting the lawyers involved, and because she knew my dad was not a healthy person to be in my life, she offered him a deal- keep the money, but relinquish custody officially. I'd still get to see him if and when I wanted, but he would give up all legal rights as a guardian. Because he hated paying my mom THAT MUCH, he took 2k over me.

We developed something resembling a positive relationship before he died. When he passed it absolutely destroyed me. I still remember the funeral. I had to be dragged kicking and screaming out of the car because I didn't want to see it. In his will he left me his car - a Camaro, that I was supposed to get when I turned 16. His parents fought tooth and nail to keep it from me (they were really shitty people, his entire side of the family was), and we eventually just told them to fuck off and keep the damn thing.\n\nFast-forward about 15 years. I find out the guy that died was not actually my dad - he was my brothers' dad. My real, biological dad has been living in the next town over, twenty minutes from my house, my entire life. My entire family knew about it, except for me. It was why my \"grandparents\" fought to keep the car - they knew I was not his son (I still don't know if HE knew or not, but I assume so).\n\nMy maternal grandmother has met him several times in my life. My mom said she never thought it was anything worth digging up. Said she intended for me to never find out.\n\nI've still never spoken to him. I know a name and an approximation of where he lives (as of about ten years ago). Beyond that, I know jack about the guy. Grandma said if I ever want to meet him, she would help me contact him. Dunno if I ever will.\n\nEdit 1: after laying all this out, and thinking more about it, there's no possible way the dead \"dad\" did not know I was not his kid.\n\nEdit 2: for everyone asking me about the lady asking if I'm her husband: no, I am not married."

He had severe burns covering his entire lower body, front to back, and ankles to waist; testicles, penis, and all. Swimming in unclean water after something like this is a recipe for disaster.

He pulled back the curtains to see the very large trashy girlfriend riding the patient. In the process they had managed to remove all of the patients lower body dressings, which my buddy stated were heavily saturated with bloody drainage, and draping off of either side of the bed. He said he remembered being hit by the smell first, but his jaw dropped when he saw her butt covered in slimy drainage and clotting blood. \n\nFrom what he remembered that guy died a week later from infection related complications. He says he still pictures what he saw on that day every time he gets a patient in that room in the ICU.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for my first gold! Woohoo!",

I was in a state of shock but I wasn't paralyzed by it so I walked over and calmly grabbed his wrists and pulled his hands from her neck. Still no sounds at all, super quiet.

That's when all hell broke loose with everyone screaming and freaking out.\n\nMy own mom asked why I didn't beat the hell out of him and I had to explain to her that I was in a sort of calm daze. I was watching someone trying to kill someone else and I just couldn't process it. As an adult now I would have absolutely beat him to a greasy pulp but I was like 16 then.\n\nShe survived with a badly bruised neck and thankfully did everything right: restraining order, divorce, moved away.\n"

            "Whilst driving from Morelia to Ciudad Hidalgo, in Mexico,  back in the 80's we had two ways to get to Ciudad Hidalgo which was the national road or the old national road which was called Mil Cumbres.  Mil cumbres basically means 1,000 curves. That stretch of road literally had 1,000 curves so a lot of people would get motion sickness when on that road. One evening on our way back to my grandparents, who lived in Ciudad Hidalgo, my grandfather was driving and he loved taking Mil Cumbres because it had really nice views and he just really loved driving that road but since we had the new national road, not a lot of people used that road anymore so it was kind of desolate with the exception of passing one or two little towns. It was dusk so soon that meant that being on such a desolate road in the moutains, we would be in complete darkness on the road with no many other cars on the same stretch of road. It took 2 hours to get to the town on that road so maybe 45 mins into the drive it had already gotten really dark and as we were driving my grandfather started slowing down. I was sitting in the back seat because my grandmother was in the front with my grandfather so I kind of stood over the front chairs to see why he was slowing down. That's when I saw a hug tree log blocking the road. My grandfather came to a stop and immediately started going in reverse to turn around and get out of the immediately. After we turned, my grandfather stepped on the gas pedal and I was sort of thrown back into the back seat. I immediately turned around to see if I could anything and as we were speeding away, I could see men, very dimly since it the light from the tail lights from the car were starting to get dimmer and dimmer, coming from out of the adjacent trees next to tree log on the road, with flashlights and guns.\n\nWe were about to get robbed and thanks to my grandfather's quick thinking and taking action immediately, we avoided it. That was the last time I was ever on that road.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [https://www.dangerousroads.org/north-america/mexico/6130-mil-cumbres.html](https://www.dangerousroads.org/north-america/mexico/6130-mil-cumbres.html)",
            "I was on i70 in Colorado going towards Utah, pulled over at a gas station at 8pm. Fueling up I noticed a couple of attractive women pumping gas, on the other side of the pump was the man in his late 40s, just staring at these young women without notice of anything else going on around him. I walk inside to go grab some food for the next few hours of driving, when I come out I see both the younger women's car and the older man's truck are gone. I decided to hang out at the gas station for the next hour to catch a little sleep before hitting the road again. \n\nAfter driving for a few hours (I was speeding heavy) I pull over at yet another gas station, the young women are there getting gas and eating some food on a picnic table. Looked like they had been there for a while. I didn't see any sign or the man in the truck but can't say I was looking very hard for it. Well here is where it got creepy as hell....\n\nCan't say I didn't stare at them a bit, I mean they were good looking women. As I am watching them leave I see in the next parking lot over some headlights turn on and it's the same man as before.... He leaves when the women leave once again. Okay that's a bit weird but could just be a coincidence as there weren't many places to pull over. I leave a few minutes later and catch up to them...now this guy is riding there ass with his high beams on. \n\nI decided to slow down and stay a distance behind the truck. 10 minutes or so later the women pull over once again to most likely get this guy off their ass... With a sign of relief the truck keeps going and I continue on my way. About 1 mile down the road the guy just pulls off to the side of the highway.... So I pull off a mile or so down the road again. Sure enough the women drive by and the guy is still following them. At this point we are out in the middle of nowhere and too many coincidences have happened. I called the cops to alert them and about 15 minutes the cops pulled the guy over. \n\nI could have just seen too many horror movies that started like this and over reacted but ya never know.

            "In college, I lived in a crappy apartment nearby the school, that was mostly populated by students. Halfway to class one day, I realized I forgot a book and had to rush back to my apartment to get it. As I was running up the stairs (which shared a wall with the stairs in the next door apartment, which mirrored my own) I could have sworn I heard someone yelling. I ignored it and ran to my room to grab my book. As I clambered downstairs, again I heard yelling, and I paused to listen. I heard some unintelligible moaning, and eventually heard the words \u201chelp me,\u201d weakly groaned from the stairs next door. I rushed out and tried their door, but it was locked. I totally forgot about my class and ran to the apartment management office, hoping that someone was there. A manager was, thank goodness, and after I explained the situation, she grabbed her master keys and we booked it back to my neighbor\u2019s place. She opened the door and the poor guy was laying in the stairwell (it was one of the ones that goes up halfway to the second floor, then turns 90 degrees for the rest of the way), clearly having fallen. I called 911 while the manager ran over to the guy. Ambulance came and picked him up, and I later learned that he had fallen down the stairs after passing into a brief diabetic coma. I guess he hadn\u2019t eaten in some time; I don\u2019t know too much about how diabetes works. Anyhow, to this day, I feel grateful that I forgot that book. That poor guy could have died, slumped halfway down the stairs with his face in the carpet.\n\nEdited to add: also, relevant to the thread, I was grateful for the thin walls. Just for that though.

            "Lajos fucking Kossuth. He's a Hungarian history figure who lived 1802 - 1894, but most notably he declared himself as Governor-President of the\u00a0Kingdom of Hungary\u00a0during the 1848-'49 revolution. \n\nFor those of you who are not really familiar with Hungarian history, the short verion is: we were fucked by everyone and never had independence since the early 1300s. This time we had beef with the Habsburgs. We really wanted independence, have Hungarian as the official language and the liberation of the serfdom. Sounds cool. \n\nBefore the revolution the two most outstanding political figures were Kossuth and Count Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi (he's actually a really cool dude, and I think he deserved the title \"the Greatest Hungarian\"). They both wanted the same things but Kossuth wanted everything ASAP, while Sz\u00e9chenyi understood that change takes time. So of course they didn't like eatchother. (With some other factors) Kossuth ended up \"bullying\" Sz\u00e9chenyi out of politics. \n\nI give Kossuth the credit for being smart and charismatic, who could motivate people with his speeches. (So one time he basically started a rally amongst common folk, because other politicians told him that discrowning the king was a bad f-ing idea. But because of the massive amount of people surrounding them, they couldn't really say no. So they did discrown the king)\n\nDuring the revolution we sucked ass. Not getting into details, we had more downs than ups. (Also some minorities revolted against Kossuth, who would not give them any rights) \n\nEnter one of my favorite historical figure: Art\u00far G\u00f6rgei. He was the greatest general in this whole scene. (And finally he has his own exhibition). He actually won against some Austrian army corps. Kossuth hated him- most likely because he feared his power- and did everyrhing to remove him from charge.\n\nBut the Austrian king (Ferdinand the 5th) asked the Russian Emperor (Nicholas the 1st) for help. So, Hungary is a small country with a small population, Russia on the other hand... you see where this is going. G\u00f6rgei wanted to go west and destroy the Austrian army, before the Russians arrive. Otherwise we're fucked. Sounds great. Not for Kossuth. He wanted to wait until the two armies merge in the east- because if they loose, he can emigrate to Turkey. \n\nThe latter happened, and Kossuth as his las fucking move, stepped back from being Governor-President and appointed G\u00f6rgei. A few days later On August 13rd, it was clear that Hungary had lost. In a hopeless situation, G\u00f6rgei signed a\u00a0surrender at Vil\u00e1gos.\n\nKossuth emigrated to Turkey, but tried to control everythimg from afar. Writing the Cassandra letter, that if we make peace with the Austrians Hungary will no longer exist. Which was bullshit. Our industry and agriculture fucking blossomed after. As a really great university professor one said \"Kossuth threw a big rock up in the air and pushed G\u00f6rgei under it\" (basically he threw him under the bus). What buffles me about this absolutely garbage of a person, that he has the biggest mausoleum in all of Hungary. It's made out of gold, marble and all that jazz. (You know what G\u00f6rgei has? A f-ing black iron cross)\n\nGod I hate him so much. Btw he died in Italy, and he still has a huge following because he was \"so great\" that every fucking town has to have at least on road named after him.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the silver kind stranger!\n\nEdit 2: changed the swear words.\n\nEdit 3: Thank you for all the response I got! I didn't expect it to blow up! Thank you for the gold, platinum, everything!\n\nTLDR: Lajos Kossuth is a charismatic politician, becomes Governor-President of Hungary during a revolution, his plan fucks the whole nation, leaves everyone to deal with what he caused by running away to Turkey, acted like a know-it-all until he died. Now has a huge following as the \"nations hero\" but he's basically an asshole."

The only thing I honestly want is to spend every waking moment with my young children. The thought of them growing up without me, without knowing who I am, is probably the thing that weighs most heavy on my mind. \n\nBut as far as actionable list items, I need to climb a mountain again. I grew up near the Rockies and have backpacked and hiked all through the southern Rockies. I keep thinking about when I'm done with chemo seeing if I can't bag a few of the simpler peaks nearish the Denver metro area. I'd like to start a group in Indianapolis with this or similar hikes/climbs in mind, but haven't done so yet. I'll look into starting this though. \n\nAlso, if anyone else in the Indy area needs anything, please DM me. I'm doing okay and would love to help someone in need out. Great thought OP!\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the ideas everyone. I'm going to look into getting a small digital video camera that myself or my wife can grab whenever to record what we are up too with the kids. I'll capture a lot of cell phone vids as well, but that can be cumbersome when trying to get an event. \n\nEdit2: Thank you kind stranger for the gilding.

You are all extremely kind and good people and I wish a million, billion blessings on each of you. \n\nEdit 6 (Sept '18): Hi! I'm still around and get a few messages a month asking how I am. Basically it looks like surgery is kind of out of the picture, so I'm back on the chemo train. Down seven infusions for this second go around and after six the response was quite significant. They changed up my regimen from the first time and this stuff is working just as well. I'm still going to work, still hanging out with the family. Still doing all I can to get ahead of the cancer and get rid of it. Thank you all for the kind words and messages.

I'm hoping they will make an exception for anything else this wonderful community has already sent. Thanks for the prayers, kind words and positive energy.\n\nEdit 2: Unfortunately, Ramon \"Ray\" Figueroa joined his Parents today in Heaven. I sincerely appreciate the outpouring of fellow Redditors putting pen to paper to try and make his last days a little bit easier.

            "My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer this spring. He's gone through two rounds of chemo and so far it has actually done a good job of shrinking the tumors. He's pretty miserable while doing chemo but he has reasonably long stretches between treatments when he feels fine. Based on his age and overall health, he could live more than a year, maybe a couple years. But it's pancreatic cancer... we are not taking anything for granted.\n\nHe's already taken a trip to Italy (where he was born), and he's visited or made plans to visit many old friends. We're all doing our best to just do everything normally. I will grieve after he's gone, not before.\n\nThe one thing he really, really wanted that he never got was an old Volkswagen bus. He used to own one, years ago, but had to sell it for various reasons. Around 20 years ago he bought a \"restorable\" one. Basically a rusty shell. He paid a local VW mechanic thousands of dollars over several years and did lots of free database work for him, but the guy was a total flake and took him for a ride. He managed to get back about half the cash he paid, but of course no work had been done, and he was also out all the time he spent working on the guy's database. Several years later, the mechanic died in a shop accident, and that was that.\n\nHe sold the shell some years ago for a few hundred bucks. It had been sitting in our driveway for years doing nothing.\n\nNow, old VW buses (specifically the split-window ones that he loves) have exploded in price, and not only is it not feasible to do a full restoration on one, he can't even really afford to buy one in rough but drivable condition.\n\nI thought about looking up local VW clubs and seeing if anyone would be willing to lend their bus to us for a day or a weekend or something, but I'm not sure if that's realistic. I don't know if anyone would be willing to lend out their rare and expensive classic car to a total stranger. On top of that, I'm afraid that even if I do manage to score a VW bus for a weekend, it'll only lead to him feeling worse because it's not *his.*\n\nSo I'm not sure. I think I just wanted to talk about this. I still think he would love to drive one before he dies.\n\nEDIT: Before anyone goes too nuts, I still need to contact the Twin Cities VW Club and find out if they know anyone who would be willing to lend us a bus or ride along or something. They seem to have a good number of meets through the summer so maybe we can find something. I've just not put a lot of effort into this yet because I wasn't sure if my dad would want to. But if I can get something arranged ahead of time, I think he would really enjoy it.\n\nAlso, thanks for all the well-wishes and support!\n\nEDIT 2: Going to a VW club meeting tomorrow evening to talk to some people and hopefully set something up. There were tons of other great suggestions and offers in response to this post that I am looking into as well. One thing is for sure - I will definitely get my dad behind the wheel of a VW bus, even if only for a little while."

We never got paid on time and management was basically a bunch of lazy jackasses who sat in the office talking all day and never actually did any managing.  It would have been hard for things to have gotten any worse but after a couple of months they brought in new management who seemed to want to make it their personal mission to run the theater as poorly as possible.\n\nThey first decided to implement a new policy requiring all projectionists to wear ties, despite the fact that projectionists are never seen by the public, not to mention that tiny little detail that the projectionists worked around giant, rapidly spinning objects that a tie could get caught in.  Management refused to reconsider the policy and every single projectionist quit as a result.\n\nThey then decided that the door people (of which I was one), who were always scheduled seven days a week, would now only be scheduled on the weekends, and refused to reassign any of us to concessions on the weekdays so we wouldn't lose hours.  As a result, almost every single door person quit, including me.\n\nAfter that they started imposing impossible cleanliness standards on concessions, things like requiring them to scrape popcorn kernels out of the cracks in the trim behind the popcorn machines.  Concessions was there until 5 AM every night trying to meet their standards.  Most of the concession people quit as a result.\n\nBy my count the theater went from a staff of about fifty to a staff of about twelve in three weeks.  I swung by about a month after I quit and found out that entire management staff had been fired and replaced yet again by an entirely new one, ones who actually seemed to be running the theater properly.

Fast forward and the new franchisee gets fired for not following regulations, they do the franchisee bid a second time and tell original manager the same thing, he can have it if he wants it.\n\nThey give the store to another person a second time! I felt bad for the guy because all of his hard work and how well he treated me, store starts going down hill causing a lot of change and a lot of pissed off people; I was the first one to walk out as all of hours were cut, the new franchisee never spoke to anyone but would bitch if we didn\u2019t do things her way, I find out 14 more people quit within a month."

            "Ooh here we go. Cocktail bartender here who is full of opinions.\n\nMy number one answer is always going to be a [Trinidad Sour](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3328/trinidad-sour) purely because of how out of left field it is for most drinkers. The base spirit being bitters instead of any of the common offenders. It's spicy, rich, complex and very well balanced for containing a shot and a half of bitters. Though I personally think it's better equal parts rye and angostura, but I love my rye.\n\nGin fans need to give the [Aviation](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/127/aviation-cocktail-diffords-recipe) a good try. It's one of the cocktails that turned me from \"I don't really like gin\" to \"turns out I just don't really like gin and tonic\". It's floral, fragrant and quite tart.\n\nIf you're an old fashioned fan, get all up in the [Sazerac](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3390/sazerac-cocktail-new-orleans-style). It's absolutely always going to be one of my biggest benchmark's of any bar I go to. If I wander into any bar that calls themselves a cocktail bar, and they don't know how to make one, I immediately default to a good ol' bourbon and coke, because I no longer trust them with anything more complicated. It's sweet, rich, spicy and all around gorgeous. This recipe is for Rye Whiskey, but I often prefer cognac if there's a good one available.\n\nVodka fans, I know you're out there and feel shy because you're a vodka fan, but try a real proper Cosmopolitan some time. I'm not going to drop you a link because frankly, most recipes for the Cosmo are very crowd pleasing, by which i mean sugary and awful. A real cosmo, in my opinion should be a nice light pink and be opaque. If it's a rich pink or purple and you can see through it, run.\n\nTry 50ml Vodka, 20ml Cointreau, 15ml Cranberry, 20ml Lime and a burnt orange zest garnish. The lime being dominant over the cranberry is a big deal in my opinion. Note that mine is very booze forward.\n\nRum fans, look, a [Daiquiri](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2153/daiquiri-no1-natural-emburys-821-formula) will always be firmly my number one rum cocktail (though I would serve this particular version with a bit less sugar). But switch things up with a [Hemingway Daiquiri](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/954/hemingway-special-daiquiri-papa-doble) for a dryer, more tart alternative. If you're a big fan of dark rum, absolutely try a dark rum old fashioned some time, it's top notch.\n\nWhiskey Sour and Scotch fans out there, need to go and give the [Penicillin](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2539/penicillin-cocktail) a good try. It's a style of ginger whiskey sour that floats a bit of smokey scotch on top to give it a bit of a bite. Always going to be one of my favourites. But if you're a scotch fan that wants to keep things on the dark and boozy end of things, try a [Bobby Burns](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/280/bobby-burns-cocktail-craddocks-recipe), which is at it's core a scotch Manhattan with a touch of Benedictine for sweetness. \n\nTequila fans, I know you exist, but you're a tough cookie to crack since you can be anywhere from margarita loving, to wanting something very out of left field dropped in front of you. If you're more of a whiskey lover outside of your tequila adoration, try an [Oaxaca Old Fashioned](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3003/oaxaca-old-fashioned) which will always be one of my favourites. If you're more on the rum and vodka side of things, try the [Toreador](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2207/toreador). A margarita twist that substitutes triple sec for apricot brandy. Another fun option is just sticking tequila in place of other spirits, it's surprisingly versatile. The penicillin I listed earlier? Try it with tequila and a smoky mezcal for the bite instead.\n\nSpeaking of Apricot Brandy, a [Charlie Chaplin](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2914/charlie-chaplin-cocktail) will always be one of my go to's for those who aren't a huge fan of cocktails that you can taste the booze in. If you like french martinis, this might be your new jam.\n\nIt's an annoying state of the bartender scene being a bit full of judgement at times that leads to a lot of drinkers being unwilling to admit they don't really know what they want to order. They may know their tastes, and always default back on a tried and true choice like the old fashioned or a french martini. If you're in a nice cosy smaller bar, and obviously if it isn't too busy at the time, talk to us! We love to help you find the exact drink for you, that may even mean a bit of experimentation behind the bar for us too. If a bartender isn't busy and isn't willing to help you find the drink for you, you're in the wrong bar.\n\nI tried to cover the alternatives and lesser known options here, but as always, the Negroni, Manhattan, Old Fashioned, Martini and other 'taste defining' classics are absolutely ones that you should give a go too.\n\nEDIT: Also fernet branca and coke because it's the nectar of the gods.\nAnd clarified that my measurements were in millilitres!\n\nBecause it's been requested, I'll point out that these cocktails are most easily found at a bar that actually calls itself a cocktail bar. Your average pub or dive bar mightn't have the materials for some of these, but when in doubt, ask!\n\nI'm in Sydney, Australia and we're lucky to have a great small bar scene here. Not gonna completely dox myself, but if you're in Sydney googlu 'Small cocktail bars' and you'll definitely find something solid. Big tip from there is to ask the bartender for recommendations! There's a solid chance you'll either start off at the bar I work in or mine will be on the bartender's list somewhere. The scene down here isn't perfect however, and if you feel like the service isn't friendly enough when it's not too busy, feel free to move along to another bar. There are a few places here that I won't mention that are a bit guilty of that. "

            "The story of Daniel Inouye, a WWII vet and later senator from Hawaii. His story reads like a bad, over the top action movie.\n\nAs soon as Japanese-Americans were allowed to enlist, he dropped out of med school and signed up. Within a year, he became a sergeant and headed a platoon, getting deployed in the Italian campaign.\n\nIn the battle to save the Lost Brigade, he was shot directly above the heart, saved by a silver dollar kept in his pocket. He was promoted to Lieutenant, the youngest officer in the regiment.\n\nIn the battle of San Terenzo,  he led from the front.\n\n>As he led his platoon in a flanking maneuver, three German machine guns opened fire from covered positions 40 yards away, pinning his men to the ground. Inouye stood up to attack and was shot in the stomach. Ignoring his wound, he proceeded to attack and destroy the first machine gun nest with hand grenades and his Thompson submachine gun. When informed of the severity of his wound, he refused treatment and rallied his men for an attack on the second machine gun position, which he successfully destroyed before collapsing from blood loss.\n\nHe stood back up.\n\n>As his squad distracted the third machine gunner, Lt. Inouye crawled toward the final bunker, coming within 10 yards. As he raised himself on his left elbow and cocked his right arm to throw his last hand grenade, a German soldier saw Inouye and fired a 30mm Schiessbecher antipersonnel rifle grenade from inside the bunker, which struck Inouye directly on his right elbow. The high explosive grenade failed to detonate, saving Lt. Inouye from instant death but amputating most of his right arm at the elbow (except for a few tendons and a flap of skin) via blunt force trauma. Despite this gruesome injury, Lt. Inouye was again saved from likely death due to the blunt, low-velocity grenade tearing the nerves in his arm unevenly and incompletely, which involuntarily squeezed the grenade tightly via a reflex arc instead of going limp and dropping it at Inouye's feet. However, this still left him crippled, in terrible pain, under fire with minimal cover and staring at a live grenade \"clenched in a fist that suddenly didn't belong to me anymore.\"\n\n>Inouye's horrified soldiers moved to his aid, but he shouted for them to keep back out of fear his severed fist would involuntarily relax and drop the grenade. As the German inside the bunker began hastily reloading his rifle with regular full metal jacket ammunition (replacing the wood-tipped rounds used to propel rifle grenades), Inouye quickly pried the live hand grenade from his useless right hand and transferred it to his left. The German soldier had just finished reloading and was aiming his rifle to finish him off when Lt. Inouye threw his grenade through the narrow firing slit, killing the German. Stumbling to his feet with the remnants of his right arm hanging grotesquely at his side and his Thompson in his off-hand, braced against his hip, Lt. Inouye continued forward, killing at least one more German before suffering his fifth and final wound of the day (in his left leg), which finally halted his one-man assault for good and sent him tumbling unconscious to the bottom of the ridge. He awoke to see the worried men of his platoon hovering over him. His only comment before being carried away was to gruffly order them back to their positions, saying \"Nobody called off the war!\"\n\n(From wikipedia)",

He had intended to drop out, and got a car back to the stadium to get his change of clothes, and just kind of started jogging when he heard the fanfare.\n* The second place finisher was carried across the finish line, legs technically twitching, by his trainers. They had been refusing him water, and giving him a mixture of Brandy and Rat Poison for the entire race. Doping wasn't illegal yet (and this was a terrible attempt at it), so he got the gold when the First guy was revealed.\n* Third finisher was unremarkable, somehow.\n* Fourth finisher was a Cuban Mailman, who had raised the funds to attend the olympics by running non-stop around his entire country. He landed in New Orleans, and promptly lost all of the travelling money on a riverboat casino. He ran the race in dress shoes and long trousers (cut off at the knee by a fellow competitor with a knife). He probably would have come in first (well, second, behind the car) had it not been for the hour nap he took on the side of the track after eating rotten apples he found on the side of the race.\n* 9th and 12th finishers were from South Africa, and ran barefoot. South Africa didn't actually send a delegation - these were students who just happened to be in town and thought it sounded fun. 9th was chased a mile off course by angry dogs. Note: These are the first Africans to compete in any modern Olympic event.\n* Half the participants had never raced competatively before. Some died.\n* St. Louis only had one water stop on the entire run. This, coupled with the dusty road, and exacerbated by the cars kicking up dust, lead to the above fatalities.

        "bestcomment": [
            "I disowned my father. I don't believe that it nearly as difficult a decision as disowning a child, but it was tough.\n\nI grew up in an upper middle class perfect nuclear family. My parents were high school sweethearts. My dad was an operator at an oil refinery, my mom was an accountant turned stay at home mom. I am a middle child- I have a 3 year older brother and a 3 year younger brother. \n\nWhen my older brother was about 10, my dad's drinking got out of hand and be became extremely physically abusive. A few years later, my mom divorced him after 23 years of marriage because she was afraid for our lives. \n\nMy dad went off the deep end. Started doing drugs, stealing, etc. Was involved in a few hit-and-runs. My older brother, who had received the brunt of the physical abuse, was manipulated into a relationship with my dad for a few years. To a lesser extent, so was I. He seemed to take an interest in us for the first time since we were little, but in hindsight it was just more manipulation and gaslighting. \n\nWont go into all of the details, but my brothers and I eventually got wind of just what kind of sketchy stuff he was involved in. My little brother and I, who both had aspirations to get into law enforcement, cut him out of our lives completely. My older brother took a while longer- he was a kid who always just wanted his dad to love him and so he was wearing blinders. He did eventually see the light, and cut my dad out as well. \n\nA few years ago, my dad was living with his mom. My grandma had been manipulated by him for years, and they had a symbiotic co- dependent relationship... she was a prescription addict and he was an \"everything\" addict. My grandma had a reverse mortgage on her home. She was diagnosed with lung cancer and given 6 months to live, and moved into a nursing home. My dad kept squatting at her house, despite the bank coming to (rightfully) claim the home. Cops got involved, and he was arrested. \n\nMy grandma slipped and fell 2 days after moving to the nursing home. She developed a brain bleed and died a few days later. \n\nMy dad had a seizure his first night in jail and was brought to the hospital, where it was determined he had a burst brain aneurysm. The doctors theorized that the aneurysm was the result of his drug use, and when he was scuffling with the cops during the arrest, his increased blood pressure and/or jarring caused it to burst.\n\nHe's now in a nursing home, and functioning at about a 6 year old's level. He has some inkling that he's fucked up royally and it is all his fault but he really doesn't understand the specifics. He can kind of communicate, and hold conversations but they're bizarre and wander all over and a lot of very strange words make their way in.\n\nI visit him a few times per year. I only do it because the person he became with addiction is dead. I believe that karma caught up to him, and he's earned his hell. I truly would not shed a tear if he dropped dead tomorrow- he's been dead to me for a decade. I do have some compassion for a sad, confused 58 year old man who is alone in a depressing nursing home with no visitors. He knows he has kids, and a wife (he doesn't understand they're divorced) and sometimes he even knows he has grandkids he has never been allowed to meet. So he doesn't understand why nobody visits him. I've started occasional visits not because I have any interest in having a relationship with him, but because unfortunately the doctors saved him when his aneurysm burst and we're left with a person who is paying for crimes he doesn't know he committed, in a world he doesn't understand. He sometimes cries when he asks to see pictures of \"that little boy\" (my nephew- his grandson) and I have to explain, yet again, why he isn't allowed to meet him. He asks me questions about \"that cop\"- my little brother, whose name he can't remember. He looks so proud when I tell him that his son is rising through the ranks and just became a K9 officer. It's like a shard of the dad he was 25 years ago has surfaced, and everything in between only exists as a convoluted fever dream. It tears my heart open as a human to see his suffering, but in a really twisted, sick way gives me satisfaction that his actions caught up to him, which makes me hate myself even more than I already did. \n\nI doubt anyone has read this- it wasn't supposed to be a novel. But that's how I disowned my dad, then kind of developed a minimal relationship with the ghost of his former humanity than now occupies his body. My heart goes out to people who have had to disown a child. I was extremely fortunate to have an incredible mom and extended family to support my brothers and me, yet I am still damaged from my time with him. Having to choose between compassion and love for a flawed person and your own or your other loved-ones' physical and mental wellbeing rips something open inside of you and leaves you permanently scarred.",
            "I'm not a parent, I've never disowned a child. My parents disowned my oldest sister. I'm the youngest of three girls. My oldest sister had a horrible relationship with my father, blames me for getting in the way of their relationship. She had her first baby (to spite him) when she was 16 years old. My father refused to give her money because she met a deadbeat child predator, and got pregnant again, the again, and again. She constantly put herself and deadbeat before kids. Dad would send money to girls for Christmas and birthdays and never heard a thing, he finally gave up... She's 30, has six daughters, and lives in a mobile home in North Carolina. \n\nWe hadn't seen or heard from my sister until June of this year. My oldest niece contacted me asking to come to Florida (where I live) for the summer to get her and her sisters out of the trailor. I agree, contact sister and she agrees, I set up plane tickets and organize the rooms they'll stay in. When they got here, they were completely disheveled. Clothes visibly dirty, smelled foul, so covered in lice that my white towels stained gray from removing them. My niece informed me that they had been without water and electricity for 6 months. They live in a 2 bedroom mobile home, there are holes in the roof, bugs and rats everywhere. As a family, we decide the girls aren't going back to North Carolina.\n\nWe tell my sister to come to my parents house in Florida to get her life together and get back on her feet. She refused because deadbeat is not invited. Ironically, she found out that deadbeat is cheating on her. She confronts him and he kicks her out of shit hole trailer. Deadbeat said \"I would rather be homeless than live with you\". Sister now works for the dollar store and doesn't pull her weight with kids. At least the girls are safe now...\n\nEdit: I never really finished my point with the story. My parents had disowned my oldest sister when she moved to North Carolina with deadbeat for six years until my niece reached out to me through Facebook. I had never even met my two youngest nieces until this event. I regret turning my back on my sister. I really hate her and what she put her babies through, but if we stayed in her life for those six years we maybe could have prevented this.",
            "My siblings and I have stopped interacting with my oldest brother. We found out that years earlier he had molested at least two boys. He was an adult at the time.

It was so disgusting to watch someone you grew up with treat people so poorly and show such a blatant disregard for others. \n The good news is that the remaining four siblings have become closer and we now are able to appreciate the good we see in each other. It\u2019s true when they say that if you could pick your family it would look much different than it is!",
            "Not me, but my great grandma. This story is really sad but also interesting, so I thought I'd share it.   \nShe was a young creole teenager- french creole was her first language, and she was a quarter-to-half black like me, with tan skin and loose brown curls. She was born in Florida, but when things started getting worse for black people in Florida, her family relocated to Texas. For those who don't know, creole people tend to play heavily into colorism. Although they are definitely mixed race, they prioritize light skinned people. The looser your curl, the lighter your skin, the more white you look, the better. Her parents had high expectations for her to marry a wealthy, light skinned man who would take care of her.  \n\n\nInstead, she met my great grandfather. A poor, dark-skinned man jumping from job to job working for farmers and trying to make a living. The two of them fell in love. They were just teenagers. Her parents threatened to disown her if she continued seeing him, and like a rebellious teenager, she refused. They wanted her to do better. She wanted to be in love.   \n\n\nThey might have broken up eventually, if she didn't get pregnant. But she did, and that was the end of it. Her parents basically said \"you've ruined your life\" and disowned her right there. The whole family disowned her. No one would speak to her- aunts, uncles, cousins, not a single person stood up for her. So she had no choice. The two of them moved to California, so he could get a job picking oranges. He built a house. They had their first daughter. She was 16. She never saw her family again.",
            "My parents disowned my oldest sister. She always struggled growing up more than us (she became a teen mom with a bad older dude, partied a lot, etc), but my parents helped her a lot. They do okay for themselves, but had a no-co-signing rule for all six of my siblings and I. Still, they co-signed for her house so she could get a head start. \n\nShe didn\u2019t pay the mortgage for almost 3 years before my mom got served in front of all the other nurses at her work. \n\nMy parents worked tirelessly to try to work out deals where my sister and her family kept the house and got some leniency, but to no avail, because my sister never showed up for court dates. During this time, she paid $12k for IVF and got pregnant with her fifth kid. \n\nWhen my mom demanded some of the money back, she accused my dad and my brother of beating her sons when my parents took them to Disney World (he didn\u2019t) and said she\u2019d file a police report if he asked for money again. They kept asking, cause it wasn\u2019t true. \n\nShe awkwardly joined us for Christmas, and punched my brother in the face during the meal for \u201chumiliating\u201d her oldest son by asking him if he wanted to work at my brother\u2019s company for good pay. Her oldest son is in and out of jail, and my brother was trying to help him after his release, but her son said he didn\u2019t want a job and got mad. She then called the cops and told them the same brother had illegal guns in his truck, and they came on Christmas night and searched his truck (no guns found!) \n\nNeedless to say, she is not welcome anywhere near any of us and my mom still cries about it, but refuses to talk to her again.",
            "My mother and her sister were both adopted into a great family. \n\nRecently, my Grandfather fell ill and we were told to prepare to say goodbye. So the family gathered. My Grandmother has had a hard time with her memory since she had a brain hemorrhage, but she welcomed my aunt into her home during this tough time. \n\nWhilst my Grandfather was in his final week, Wendy (aunt) took my Grandmother's atm card and proceeded to spend well over a thousand dollars on herself and get herself a motel room. She alsp attempted to steal their car. When my uncles found out, she basically disappeared into the wind. \n\nAfter my Grandfather passed and his funeral was all sorted. My Grandmother went to an attorney to write Wendy out of any inheritance she would get from their estate when she passes. She didnt press any formal charges, because the whole process would have been lengthy and more painful for her. She didn't need the extra stress.\n\nI'm pretty sure one of my uncles also threatened Wendy to make sure she stayed away from my Grandmother from now on too.",

Prevention is becoming more and more important in medicine, and treating a disease in its early stages is a lot better than catching it late. If you have family members who had ovarian or colon cancer in their 30s, that is very significant for your own risk. The screening and tests we run might change, depending. If you want to start the pill, it's important to know about breast cancer, DVTs, clotting disorders in the family. If you're a bit overweight and have no metabolic syndrome problems in the family, compared to a bit overweight but both your parents have type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the management priorities change. Asking your family about any recurring diseases or diseases that occurred early (20s, 30s, maybe 40s) can be helpful. \n\n\nThere are certain common conditions that are underdiagnosed but easily fixed.

IO have even decided to leave in certain bugs/issues because of how fun/funny they are, and how much fans seem to enjoy them.\n\nThere are no micro transactions. There is no in-game currency. All items must by unlocked by PLAYING the game.

They\u2019ve added tons of features and items requested by fans, and they\u2019ve even designed maps based on what players have been asking for - the Whittleton Creek map being the most obvious example of a map designed purely as fan service, considering it features nearly everything suggested and requested by fans, AND is named after arguably the most beloved mission of the franchise which also takes place in a suburban neighborhood- A New Life (the new one is called Another Life).\n\nHitman 2 is a labor of love, and an example of a developer who cares more about its fans than about making money.

Ambulance noticed S seemed to be drugged, GG was drinking something else by then (watered down cocktails without him even noticing) and we alerted the police, who found 4 tubes of GHB on him. \n\nIn the end GG was arrested and S rushed to hospital.\n\nEdit:\nWhoa, didnt expect this many reactions.\nHere some answers:\n-This was indeed on stratumseind, the bars in question unfortunately do not exist anymore.\n-We called it Virginxxx because at this time (around 2008-2010) we never expected it to be used so much, later we even changed the name every 3 months.\n-GHB is officially a medical aid, later rape drug which is too easy to produce at home, this makes control over it even harder and the drug only more dangerous.",

People push their way into the intersection, the light turns red, and they are stuck there until the light is about to turn red in the opposite direction, at which point those people push their way into the intersection and the cycle perpetuates.  During rush hour, they have police standing in the intersections--not to direct traffic, though, simply to hold their hand up when the light turns red so that people don't push their way into the intersection.  Basically, a human has to stand in traffic for hours JUST to tell the drivers what the lights mean. It was unbelievable.",

Due to good old xenophobia, it eventually came to mean \u201cuncivilized\u201d, and from there it made its way through the centuries into Middle English. ",

There used to be a proper name for bear, but it was taboo because saying it was believed to summon a bear, who would then kill everyone.

One of the primary products on offer at these fairs was lace. \"St. Audrey's lace\" was said a few too many times, and got slurred down to \"tawdry lace.\" \n\nOver time, the lace fell out of favor. It was mainly made by peasant women, and thus viewed as cheap, and the Puritans looked down on lace garments of any kind as ostentatious. \"Tawdry\" then began to be used to describe other things that were cheap and ostentatious, and the modern definition of the word was born.\n\ntl;dr: \"Tawdry\" comes from the fact that \u00c6thelthryth is really hard to pronounce."

            "We had a very sweet blond haired blue eyed mom and dad along with their entire extended family in the room for a delivery one busy afternoon at work (think aunts, Uncles, cousins, Grandma and Grandpa too). The baby is born and as the doctor places her on the mom\u2019s chest the first words out of her mouth are \u201cThat\u2019s not my baby! That\u2019s not my baby!!\u201d \n\nThe baby in question, still attached at the umbilical cord, has beautiful dark curly black hair, and dark skin. The nurse looks at her and tells her that this is definitely her baby because \u201cshe\u2019s still attached to you\u201d and she, not so quietly, tells the nurse \u201cThere\u2019s no way, I never slept with a black man! It\u2019s not mine!\u201d \n\nThe \u201cfather\u201d is standing there silent, not sure what to do. A long awkward silence fills the room. \n\nWe clean her and baby up as cheerfully as we can. We see the extended family filter out of the room and the \u201cfather\u201d leave to get a cigarette. About ten minutes later a tall black guy walks up to our front desk asking how to get to the patient in question\u2019s room.",
            "I was assisting at a Caesarian when I was a junior doctor.

            "Paramedic here, our crew delivered a full birth in the back of our rig. We have 2 paramedics in the back with the PT, a driver, and I\u2019m working on the laptop listening to info they are telling me to add to the report.  All the sudden, it goes kind of quiet, I hear the mother let out a very loud \u201cOh shit, it\u2019s not white!\u201d (She was very white)\n\nFew more seconds of silence, and I\u2019m like, \u201c?\u201d\n\nThe driver alarm(beeping light on the center console sent from a button in the back) was pressed 2 times quickly, generally meaning to turn around to get info for the report. I turn from the front passenger seat to see a very dark skin colored baby.(I\u2019m guessing Cuban) I can\u2019t see the mothers face, but all I see is her shacking her head. She begins to worry, saying that \u201cher husband is meeting us there at the hospital! He can\u2019t see this!!!\u201d. I just continue the report, and am not sure what the problem is, but I guess we\u2019ll see when we get there. \n\nFlash forward, to the ER. We stop outside the ambulance bay, I get out to open the doors, and am met by another very white heavyset guy in a uniform shirt, dress pants and glasses, asked me if his wife was in there and she was in labor when he was coming home.\n\nHospital policy dictates that we can\u2019t have random people that we can\u2019t confirm identity that close to the rig when opening doors for PT safety. Security is there quick, holds him back a bit. We open the doors, roll the PT and her newborn out. He takes one look, sees the color of the baby, \n\n*JAW DROP*, LOOK OF DESPAIR. Like a 1000 yard stare. Even security had a look like, \u201cwow, that women fucked up, and this guy knows it now\u201d\n\nWife: \u201cBABE, I can explain every bit of this!!! I know it looks weird, but I can!!!!\u201d\n\nWe wheel her into ER. No sign of husband. Last I knew, the husband didn\u2019t check into the hospital as a visitor. I\u2019m assuming he went home to pack his stuff.",
            "Okay I am a nurse but this isn\u2019t a story about a birth I witnessed, it was my own birth. And although my mother definitely didn\u2019t cheat, all the midwives were convinced she had. And yeah it\u2019ll be buried but I think it\u2019s a funny story so I\u2019m going to share.\n\nFor background: my mother (J) is white, and had got married young to another white guy (D) (actually forced to by my grandparents who were horrified she was living in sin). Their relationship petered out and they separated but remained very good friends. Then she met my father (A), a black man, and began a relationship with him. Mum was still married at the time, neither her nor her husband were in a hurry to get divorced, and he became good friends with Mums new partner (my dad). \n\nMum fell pregnant with me. Time moves along. She goes into labour and needs to head up to the hospital. Dad was working and couldn\u2019t make it home in time to get her there, so still being good friends with the husband, she rings him and he comes around to drive her to hospital and decides to hang out until I\u2019m born.\n\nAfter an hour or so dad arrives. He was freaking out a bit so his best friend (H, also a black guy) drove him because dad didn\u2019t trust himself. They arrive at the hospital right as mum is ready to deliver. The midwives come out to the waiting room to grab the \u201chusband\u201d to be there when baby is born. They knew that mum\u2019s actual husband (D) had driven her there so assumed that he was the father of the baby. Went and grabbed him and tried to drag him into the delivery room. He freaked out and yelled \u201cNo no, I\u2019m not the father, I\u2019m just the husband! The father is Aboriginal!\u201d\n\nDad and H pulled up into the car park as this is happening, and dad leaps out of the car. Decides he needs to have a quick smoke to settle his nerves before he goes in. His best friend H doesn\u2019t smoke (cigarettes but does smoke weed and is pretty stoned) so he walks in ahead. \n\nJust then the midwives come running back to the waiting room to grab the actual father, and see the only black guy in there. Obviously him right? So they take him and suit him up to bring him down to delivery. Being pretty stoned, H doesn\u2019t question this and just goes along with it. The midwives reach the delivery room and shove him inside.\n\nMum, legs in stirrups and at the pushing stage goes absolutely ballistic. \u201cNOT THAT BLACK GUY, HES NOT THE FATHER, GO GET THE OTHER ONE\u201d.\n\nThe midwives hustle H out and return him to the waiting room to wait with D. A (my dad) has come inside by now and the midwives marched up to him and said something like \u201cI hope you\u2019re the father this time otherwise I\u2019m going to just give up and she can birth alone.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s the story about how the hospital went through three different men before they finally got to my actual father.",
            "Paramedic here.\n\nHad a mother give birth to a healthy baby in a home. Situational awareness had not helped me yet at this point. I asked if the father was here to cut the cord. (We paramedics usually shy away from this duty because it opens us up to unwanted legal ramifications should something go wrong) There was a calm in the air after I asked the question and went on to do it myself. Come a few moments later, I was approached by another occupant of the home who informed me that this was a home for victims of sexual assault and that the father of the baby was indeed also tho father of the mother and was currently incarcerated due to the aforementioned \u201csituation\u201d. It was an awkward ride to the hospital after that.",

This was remedied by plate guarding and defensive maneuvers with utensils if hands got too close.\n\nOn my parent\u2019s first date, my mom reached for something to try off my dad\u2019s plate and he instinctively stabbed her hand with his fork - drew blood and everything.

I apologized, she said it was ok and that the screen was already like that before.\n\nAlmost a year later she confessed that I actually broke her phone that day. She had just gotten it from her mom (all phones she ever had were second hand, very simple ones) and she couldn't afford a new one at the time, but still she lied and kept using the broken phone so I wouldn't feel bad.

            "I have a story of a friend who was severely mismanaged. I've probably posted it before, but I'm to lazy to look. \n\nFor 2 years, my friend had been going to her GP complaining about migraines, bouts of severe vomiting, and dizzy spells. Every time, he would order bloodwork, then tell her she was fine.\n\nOne morning, she woke up, and after a sexy morning with her husband, could barely stand. She was so dizzy and had such a bad migraine. She told her husband not to worry, sent him to work and had her neighbour driver her to the emergency room. She doesnt remember arriving. \n\nWhen she got there, she started acting erratic. They had to sedate her, and sent her for a CT scan of her head. There, they noticed a huge mass in her brain. The hospital wasnt equipped to deal with that, so they sent her by ambulance to the nearest hospital that could, a 4 hour drive away. \n\nThis hospital immediately sent her for an MRI. It wasnt a mass. They could actually see the \"mass\" growing as they did the MRI. No, she was having a massive stroke. \n\nShe was immediately taken in for surgery. They put in a stent, and had to remove most of the left side of her brain as it was all dead. Afterwards, she was in a coma for nearly 72 hours. They were uncertain if she would wake up, and if she did, if she would ever recover. \n\nThankfully, she did. It took almost a year of physio, and speech therapy (among a few others), but she has made almost a complete recovery.  They even had their first child 8 months ago. \n\nTurns out, she had incredibly high cholesterol. With all the bloodwork that was done, her GP should have caught it. When she confronted him, he told her that her diagnosis was wrong. That she hadn't had a stroke and had made it up. She went after his license.",
            "Psychiatrist here. A 30 year old man with mild depressive symptoms was in-and-out of the hospital fairly quickly. He was under pressure from his home life, living with 4 roommates who were making life a bit difficult for him. No suicidal thoughts. He was cleared of all psychopathologies by me and two other doctors. \nA few months later he came back. Same symptoms, however this time he talked about 5 roommates. It felt wrong, and I digged in his story. Tried to contact his roommates. He lived alone and was severely psychotic. I have no idea to this day how he hid it so well from everyone.\n\nEDIT: a few more details:\nThe patient talked, dressed and acted normally however after admitting him for a longer period we noticed he talked with his \"roommates\" often. He was single, no contact with his family and somehow working, however in a routine job with little to no personal contact. \nAfter a few talks he also claimed other peoples thoughts were sometimes \"thrown at him and sitting on his head\", and he could thus read people's minds against his will. The interesting thing about this patient was, that his internal world somehow fitted the external world when asked - his roommates sounded perfectly plausible (they were not e.g. shadow-people, vikings, 12 m tall) and they teased him by hiding his stuff. But he ate with them, watched TV with them, so on. \nNormally a person with paranoid schizophrenia (paranoid meaning all types of delusions) will have multiple symptoms sometimes easy to see for the untrained eye. The patients can dress, talk and present themselves in odd ways, usually different from cultural norms. They can have incoherent speech, make up words and phrases or are clearly separated from reality (another patient of mine insisted that I was in jail for medicating him, even when we talked). \nWhen we quickly \"scan\" a patient for psychotic symptoms we basically look for inconsistencies in the patients experience of the world - the patients normally know \"something is wrong\" or \"weird\" or \"different\", but often belive it is the world around them, that have changed. This is due to discrepancy between what they experience (input), failed assessment of the inputs (due to the thinking disorder) and testing hypothesis based on failed assessments which collide with the real world. This will activate defense mechanisms fx denial, wild explanations, accepting both \"realities\" at the same time, and so on. (e.g \"I am not sick, my doctor must be a bad guy, bad guys are in jail, my doctor are in jail, but my doctor is sitting right in front of me at the same time, he must have an identical twin or this is an alternate reality). This is usually the way delusions are made. \n\nTo summarize: when we scan for psychosis, we look for inconsistencies between the patients subjective experience of thinking, being and acting and the objective reality accepted by the generel cultural norm.

            "I've had a couple of gems, but the one that really sticks out in my mind actually happened about a month or so ago.\n\nA young mother brought in a 6 year old to emerg, she was super nice, and apologetic because she thought that she was wasting my time, because she said that her son had started to develop different spots all over his body and she has no idea why. My initial first thought was chicken pox, so I had some swords and shields up ready to go for the anti-vax debate, but she claimed that she had her son vaccinated at all stages up to that point, and upon closer inspection they were mass of clusters of warts.\n\nNot uncommon, but because of how rapidly that they were growing, I ordered some blood work to make sure there wasn't an underlying cause as kids immune systems are pretty well equipped to handle that sort of thing. And I'm really glad that she brought him in, because he had a severely low white blood cell count which revealed a primary immune deficiency disease.",
            "This is my second story to post here but a great story no less.  Mid 30's man walks into my office with what looks like a black eye and a broken blood vessel in the front of his left eye.  He went to his primary and it was simply assumed that he got punched or hit or something, and he was dismissed.  He was noted to have high blood pressure, but a script for medicine was written and a follow up in a few months.  Gentleman comes in to see me to get another opinion on the matter and I look at him and immediately start the line of questions: How long has it been there, do you have a headache, and when you plug your ears with your fingers do you hear a \"wooshing\" sound?  He had a cavernous sinus fistula (CCF).  I sent him directly to the emergency room with his family of 4 in tow and he was in the OR within an hour of arriving.  Saved his eye and possibly his life that day.\n\nThe best news: He was a kitchen guy at my local diner which I frequent and they still treat me like royalty there when I come to eat.

She waited a year, hoping it would go away but it never did, she asked multiple doctors and did multiple x-rays but doctors said the replaced hip was fine. We finally made her go to a private clinic in my hometown, and the doctor saw that the replaced hip was fine and dandy, but the bone around it looked like it was a tad bit eaten by bacteria.\n\nSo the new doc did an operation, and there was so much pus in the leg it was insane.

The NICU doc insisted my dad was nuts to the parents.  Dad was right and the kid had a brain bleed and was rushed to surgery.  The baby would have died without the nurse bringing my dad in and the parents listening to him.  As is, that extra time almost certainly cost brain function.",
            "Eye Doctor here.  I had a patient I saw several months before they came in for their visit but well less than a year, which often means something could be wrong.  In this case, as it turns out, nothing was wrong with her by way of complaints, she just wanted to get updated before getting some new glasses. We decided to just run the regular gamut of tests anyway just because we might as well while she was there.  She was a 50YO woman, fairly normal exam, perfect vision, retinas showed healthy, but something about her pupils really bothered me before I dilated.  We chatted about it and I asked her if she banged her head or anything weird and she said no, but suddenly reveals this crazy history of an old Meningioma (a type of tumorous brain growth) she had removed a few years ago.  She had decided to omit this from her history with us as she didn't feel it was important, but we went and put it into the charts anyway.  Turns out she got a CT done two weeks prior to her exam with me which she says turns up completely normal.  I tell her she should tell her doctor about this anyway just to cover our bases.\n\nFast Forward: Patient shows up in my office ecstatic to tell me that my examination revealed that her tumor had returned with an incredible vengeance.  She had no idea, was totally asymptomatic and the CT she had prior to me showed what was very literally the size of a spec of dust which the radiologist dismissed as \"artifact\".  On her return to her doctor, they decided to re-run the CT to cover THEIR Bases, and they found a QUARTER SIZED TUMOR.  Within Two Weeks the tumor went from the size of a dust particle to a QUARTER.  She was rushed into emergency surgery as the tumor was growing SUPER fast and was close to a blood vessel which could cause a massive stroke.  She had it removed that day and returned to me after recovery to tell me of what got discovered as a result of my testing.  She is now a long time regular patient I have been seeing for about 10 years.\n\nEdit: Thank you kind giver of Gold and Silver!  It\u2019s good to be gilded!  \n\n\nEdit: For those asking about the pupils, they were asymmetric, and the larger one reacted less robustly compared to the fellow eye.  This was a marked change from her previous examinations where no pupillary defects were noted.",
            "22 yo guy came in after seeing his primary at another hospital.  His mom was my patient and asked if I would see him (I am an Internal Med doc).  He had told his doctor he had a headache.  I did a usual full review of symptoms since he was new and he also marked his left testicle had a lump.  Did exam and he had hard small lump on testicle.  Knew right away likely had metastatic testicular cancer.  1 stat brain scan and Testicular ultrasound later confirmed it.\n\nAsked him if told other doctor about the lump and he said yes but the other doctor told him it was normal.\n\nEdit: He lived by the way but it was close a few times.  \n         So fellows if you note a lump on your testicle ask for an ultrasound and don\u2019t be embarrassed to bring it up.\n\nEdit 2: For those of you who are concerned after examining yourself:  \nThere is a small soft area posteriorly that should be similar on both your testicles known as the epididymis.  \nThat is normal.\n A hard lump on only one side only is not.  Monthly self checks between ages 15-34 can be done but since rare (5/100,000) not a general recommendation."

App notifications, Skinner box games, easy access to diversion at all times via our phones, lack of silence due to music streaming, podcasts, audiobooks, etc. We are being trained out of being able to handle stillness and silence, and our brains aren't designed to handle constant anxiety and jumping of attention from thing to thing without a feeling of completion. Basically all streaming services now autoplay, most popular games are infinite (Clash of Clans, Hearthstone, Bubble Witch, etc), most people work in the service industry so they don't get a feeling of a completed job.\n\nI'm not sure how I would shorten this idea, but the prevalence of machine-learned delivery of instant gratification aimed at our psychological weak points available at our fingertips at literally all times probably isn't going to help us deal with the awkwardness that is real life relationships between us with each other, and us with the world.\n\nEDIT: I'm happy to wake up this morning and see that this has resonated with many people. Here are some sources I have used to inform and equip myself to begin to overcome the mindless loss of control I have had over my own mind.\n\n[First, a short video to grab your attention. (heh)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edx9D2yaOGs) (Thanks u/woxianghekafei)!\n\n[The manipulative tricks tech companies use to capture your attention | Tristan Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C74amJRp730)\n\n[Quit social media | Dr. Cal Newport | TEDxTysons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk) - \"I am a Millenial, computer scientist, book author, standing on a TED stage, and yet I have never had a social media account.\" - Dr. Cal Newport\n\n[Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) - By Dr. Cal Newport, the speaker in the above talk. Fragmented attention is a serious issue for people nowadays, both for their mental health as well as their earning potential. Rates of self-reported generalized anxiety are very high, especially in the younger generations, and Dr. Newport attributes part of that to social media, and the smart phone, app notification, attention-grabbing economy in general.\n\n[Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard](http://heathbrothers.com/books/switch/) - In *Deep Work*, Dr. Newport talks about concentration being a muscle that needs exercise. This book discusses how our willpower is more like a tank of gas; you have a finite amount of it, and you need to let it fill back up occasionally if you want to use it. If you find yourself glancing at your phone constantly when you are trying to read a book, or watch a sunset, or sit at dinner with friends, there are more and less effective ways to train yourself to both be less distracted by your phone, as well as not have that anxious feeling that even though you are not looking at your phone you *really want to*. Instead of keeping it on silent in your pocket, why not turn it off and put it in a drawer in your room while you read a book in the living room? If you are at dinner, turn your phone off and give it to someone else and ask them to give it back before you leave. If you, as the book puts it, \"shape the path\" to more easily get you what you want, you will find yourself exerting less willpower and feeling less anxiety to achieve the same goal.\n\nEDIT AGAIN: Okay, I've fielded questions and discussed related topics in responses for a couple hours now. I hope this discussion has at least given people something to think about or relate to, and possibly even given some motivation to change if they feel it is needed. I'm turning off notifications for this post to respect my own personal time. If anyone has any other questions I recommend discussing them with a friend or loved one in person, especially if you feel like you are alone in having these feelings of anxiety or distraction.

To answer the question \"why would you even eat there?\" Our trip up until that point had been very well planned. Stayed in a great Holiday Inn with a delicious international breakfast buffet. Tour bus was very clean. The highlight of the trip was when they took us to a pineapple farm and we got to sample (hint: supermarket pineapple has *nothing* on the fresh stuff).\n\nMost of the restaurants we had been taken to were, by Western standards, quite clean. This one was definitely an outlier in that regard but by this point we had developed a trust in our guide.

If there's pissed off people, get out as fast as you can obviously. If everyone is kinda apathetic and not talking to each other much, get out. That's also a shitty environment, everyone is probably really passive aggressive, and that's going to show.

            "What the hell happened to make my dog terrified of the bed for 3 days last year.\n\nEdit: The 'story' for those who were asking..\n\nEdit 2: All the demon, ghosts, etc. comments. Kinda freaked me out, lol, glad I don't live there anymore.\n\nI have a huge dog, (130lbs), named Monkey, who's favorite pastime is lounging on the bed and watching TV. I came home from work one night and received my normal, \"OMG you've been gone for so long I thought I was gonna die, and I can't find the remote so come change the channel.\" Welcome home greeting. I was in a studio apt, so the bed basically doubled as a couch, kitchen table, and anything else because its a King Size bed in a studio apt.\n\n (Side note, I used to have a smaller bed but I kept waking up just before hitting the floor as Monkey pushed me over and out so he could stretch out. Moved up one size at a time, now there isn't any bigger, so I sleep against the wall so he can't push me out, although I have woke up with feet in the floor).\n\nI digress, so, Monkey, King of the bed, Lord of the loungers, has his own size permanent divit in the mattress, is all jumpy happy when I get home, we do our normal routine, nothing out of the ordinary, I'm kicking back on the bed watching TV and I realized Monkey's not up here.. humm what's he up to. I call him, he's like 4 foot from the foot of the bed and will not come any closer. He's whimpering and pacing, and looking distressed. I immediately jump off the bed to where he is because obviously there's a death serpent or some equivalent on or under the bed. I'm freaked out, he's freaked out, I ask him where it is, ready to do battle. But he's acting just the same, he'd normally be on whatever demon possessed nightmare that dared to enter his domain. But nothing, he will not get closer than 4 feet to the bed. I grab my steel toed boots, my welding gloves, my leather apron, and welding helmet (hey I've heard there are snakes that spit, fuck that noise) I'm armed with the aptly named dead blow hammer, and I start carefully, meticulously disassembling the bed, and I mean all the way down to the frame. I check with a black light for hidden monsters. Nothing, not a damn thing. So I check again piece by piece, put new sheets and pillows on just in case. Nothing. Check all around the frame, the area, the whole damn apt. Nothing. I remove my battle armor, and call him an asshole because he was just fucking with me right? Nope, he still wont come near the bed. I tried bribing him with treats, then lunch meat, steak, pizza, ice cream (this dog would moon walk backwards over hot coals for some ice cream) Nope, nothing doing, he's not coming near the bed. For three days, I couldn't bribe him, entice him, or force him onto that bed. Then just like that, on day four he carefully approached the bed, laid down, and wanted me to give him all that bribe food I'd been showing him. Never could figure out what the hell happened, and I'm dying to know.\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/tqHIBRD"

            "The outcome was dramatic and incredibly tragic. \n\nI had a colleague once who drunkenly confessed to sleeping with her step brother. Eventually it developed into a serious relationship. Her parents got to know and desperately tried to get them to breakup. Colleague ended up dating her step bro in secret.\n\nIt's an open secret in the office at this point. Awkward, because the stepdad was also in upper management. Anyway, her parents find out again and try to get them to break up a second time. It's all gets rather public and ugly and quite embarrassing for her Mom and stepdad who are now senior figures in the industry running their own company.\n\nColleague tells us that she's been given ultimatums from her Mum. Doesn't describe what they are. Suddenly, she stops showing up to work and emails her resignation. She tells HR that she's moving to the US to find some peace. Colleague also texts some folk at work to tell then that she's had enough of the drama and moving away.\n\nA few weeks pass and there's no news from her until her step bro/ boyfriend starts contacting all her work friends. I wasn't contacted but some of my teammates were. Stepbro is desperately trying to get in touch with her she's broken up with him via text. He wants to know if anyone's heard from her. He doesn't believe that she now lives in the US and that she'd go without telling him. Everyone writes him off as a guy who couldn't handle the rejection, until he goes to the police and files a missing persons case. \n\nPolice actually made a few inquiries to everyone's suprise. It doesn't happen often because they usually dgaf. This is still a developing country after all. In the end the cops write the stepbro off as a lovesick loon and everything settles down. For a while at least.\n\nStepbro has gone crazy, now claiming that he thinks something bad happened to her. Says he's fallen out with his parents over it. No one at work wants to get involved in this family drama, especially since the parents are important people.

They've arrested her mom's chauffeur on an unrelated charge and he confesses to murdering our colleague. Even leads them to the body. He doesn't however reveal a motive. He must have been stalking her think the police until they investigate further. Our colleague never went to the US. Turns out the emails she sent weren't from her either. They were sent after her death.\n\nThe texts, the emails and the breakup were all from her Mom. She covered her tracks after she orchestrated the murder of her own daughter. All because she wouldn't stop dating her step brother and was going to marry him.\n\nSorry for the bad grammar. English isn't my first language. I'd forgotten some details. The colleague's Mum always had a strained relationship with her daughter. At social events she often claimed to be her sister, through everyone knew it wasn't true.

            "I was a missionary in South Africa. One of the creepiest things that happened to me, was on New Years Eve. During that night, I woke up feeling really thirsty. I walked toward the refrigerator in the kitchen, and as I was drinking water, I turned around and the front door was wide open. I could see the stars in the black sky and hear the faint sound of crickets in the distance. Not thinking anything of it, I closed it and went back to bed. In the morning, my missionary companion woke up first and noticed the door was wide open. It was then that we realized we had been robbed throughout the night, and I still remember my heart dropping as I realized the perpetrators were most likely in the dark house while I was in the kitchen in the middle of the night. Still gives me goosebumps thinking about it.",

His mom came back and was looking for him. I tried to tell the adults in my apt but no one believed me or the other kids with us. Still the scariest thing that haunts me to this day.",

Mum says that *really quite often*, both I and the dog would stop whatever we were doing at the same time and both look towards the stairs as if we were watching something either descend or ascend them. \n\nThis is corroborated by my dad and a few of their friends who saw it happening. It's basically their friend group's weird inexplicable story, I just happen to be an unwitting part of it. Unfortunately I have no memory of this at all and the dog in question died 30 years ago, so they'll never get their answer."

I had my bartending flashlight on me and shone it on them hoping they would run thinking I was the cops. this ended up being what saved me because they all threw their weapons as they ran.

The police report and my neighbors (girls who thankfully grabbed my sweet golden retriever) said that I lasted for over a minute and was holding my own. Then  a cab driver tried to help by running some of them over. That separated me from the group and allowed one of them to pick up a 2x4 and crack me in the back of the head. Luckily a police officer drove by about the time they were dragging my unconscious body up the street and kicking me.

            "I hope this counts.  It was unexplainable when I was a child, but I've since learned more.\n\nMy father was the youngest of 11 kids.  That meant I had a lot of Aunts and Uncles.  I didn't meet all of them growing up as a child, but I met quite a few.  However, I was always told growing up that it was impossible for me to have met one specific aunt, because she died \"long ago.\"  Yet I remembered meeting this aunt at my grandparent's house when my grandmother's funeral was being held.\n\nI was a young kid, age 10, and there were very few cousins my age in attendance.  In fact, my being there was seen as offensive to some of the aunts and uncles because \"death isn't for children.\"  This was back in 1979, so there was very little to occupy my time.  I ate food, because there was a lot of food on the table.  I sat and \"listened\" to what the grownups were saying, and quickly lost track because I didn't understand a bit of it.\n\nEventually, my father got sick of being told that I was not welcome and handed me a bag of toy cars and sent me into a back room, where I couldn't be seen or heard.  I played with the cars for a while when a woman came in.  She said she was my aunt, because she was my father's sister and not because she was married to any of my father's brothers.  She was obviously older than my dad, but definitely wanted to play cars with me, which I thought was very strange.  She wasn't dressed in black like everyone else, and she talked funny.  We had fun playing cars for a while, then she left.\n\nEveryone insisted for decades that it was impossible for me to have met her, and that I was wrong.  I was also admonished many times to stop bringing it up, stop mentioning her name, and, most especially, to stop referring to her as my \"aunt\" or to imply that she was a sibling to my father or any of his other siblings.\n\nSo, here's where I explain what I learned as a adult.  This sibling was born \"wrong\" somehow.  She might have been developmentally disabled, had cerebral palsy, hell, she might just have been on the autism spectrum.  But in the time that she was a child, you didn't acknowledge children like that.  She was, literally, locked in an attic room, and left there, fed in the room and never talked to, or let out of the room.\n\nWhen she was still a child, but not yet an adult, she was taken from the house and put into a \"special home,\" a nice phrase that meant insane asylum.  Where she was warehoused for the rest of her life.  The younger siblings were only told that she died, while the older ones were aware that she was taken away.  She *was* still alive until 1987, at least.  And it was very possible and likely that one of her older siblings might have brought her home for the funeral of her mother where I met her.",

            "I saw the original Jurassic Park when it was in theaters in the summer of 1993. I was 7 years old. During the scene at the end where the velociraptors are about to get Alan Grant and co., I very clearly remember the T-Rex suddenly bursting through the wall of the visitors center before it grabs the first raptor in its jaws. The wall was made out of a greyish-white material--concrete or plaster. Back in those years you had to wait a long time for movies to come out on VHS, but when it finally did and my parents brought it home I couldn't wait to watch it. I remember being confused at the end, because I was waiting in that tense raptor scene for the T-Rex to come bursting through the wall, but instead it was just suddenly there, grabbing the raptor, as we can all see in the film. I thought that it didn't seem to make much sense now, because how did the T-Rex get in the building all of a sudden seemingly without anyone noticing? I suppose I put it out of my mind, and always just figured that it was either my imagination or that the scene of the T-rex crashing through the wall appeared only in the theatrical version and was removed for the home video, but then recently I decided to google about that scene and was shocked to discover (at last) that there were others that remembered this scene as well: [https://jurassicpark.fandom.com/wiki/Jurassic\\_Park\\_Deleted\\_Scenes](https://jurassicpark.fandom.com/wiki/Jurassic_Park_Deleted_Scenes)(*Rumors persist that the theatrical version of \"Jurassic Park\" included a scene towards the end of the film where the Tyrannosaurus actually smashes through a plaster wall in the Visitor Center. This scene was not included in the DVD or VHS release of the film, and no evidence other than first person accounts has been found for this scene's existence.*\u00a0\n\n*Steve Spaz Williams in his Vimeo channel said no such scene ever existed. Spaz cannot be said of towing the official line as he is no longer with ILM or even in mainstream Hollywood for the matter of fact. So, it may be assumed that he is telling the truth. Here is the link to his comment-* [*http://vimeo.com/39431924*](http://vimeo.com/39431924)) --- In other words, Steve Williams, who built the T-Rex used in Jurassic Park and worked on the other dinosaur effects, has stated that there is no such scene. Here's his response in the comment section of the above vimeo link when asked if there was a scene where the T-Rex broke into the visitors center at the end:\n\n>**steve spaz williams**[**PLUS**](https://vimeo.com/plus)6 years ago  \n>  \n>we never did a shot where we saw the rex enter the rotunda area. it was speilberg who actually added that sequence cause he was so happy with how all the other shots were proceeding. steve price (who dies during jamunji) animated that final shot.\n\nTLDR: When I saw Jurassic Park in the cinema I remember the T-Rex burst through the wall at the end to get the raptors. Others remember this scene too. No such scene exists on home video versions and in fact appears never to have existed at all.",
            "My family and I were driving out of Bellows, a campsite/beach for military families in Hawai'i. I lazily gaze out the window and something catches my eye. About 30 feet away in a clearing before a metal gate leading into the forest was a massive bird. Like 8 feet tall massive. It had a long neck, brown feathers, and very thick long legs.\n\nMy jaw dropped and I was still processing what I had seen when my dad said, \"What the hell was that?\" Turns out he had seen it too, and we both described it identically. No one else saw it, and by the time our brains had caught up with our eyes it was too late to turn around.\n\nI will always regret not turning around. When we returned later in the day there was nothing there. When we asked a guard about it he laughed at us. I scoured the internet afterward, and it looked like nothing I could find. At least, nothing that isn't extinct- it looked amazingly similar to one of the larger species of moa... but those lived in New Zealand thousands of miles away and died out hundreds of years ago.\n\nThis happened back in 2009 and to this day I wonder whether I saw a Lazarus species.\n\n\nEdit: I appreciate all the attempts to help illuminate what my dad and I saw!

I realised she was awake as well and told her I'd had a bad dream, and as I started to describe it, she started talking along with me, describing the same dream. In it, this black creature that looked like a bull, only it had shiny, scaly, plastic looking skin, was standing in the open window with this weird mechanical device, and it somehow fired a projectile at the lamp in the room, which started rocking back and forth. Neither of us wanted to get up and close the window in case the thing was actually out there, so we called for our mum and she closed it, reassured us in typical mum fashion, etc. For months we would talk about that incident and we could never figure out how we both managed to have the same exact dream at the same time.",

I'm certain it wasn't a dream, because I recalled the rest of what happened the previous day to her, only to be met by her confirmation that everything I remembered was correct, right down to how shaky I was and how upset I seemed. All except for the part that humanity was on the brink of extinction.\n\nPS.\nI am aware that, yes, it is true that most if the world's population is dead.

We\u2019re due with our first child soon and they\u2019re gonna have to figure out how to be grandparents together. Thankfully I\u2019m 1500 miles from them so it won\u2019t be a headache often.",
            "I worked at a law firm that only practiced family law (divorces, child custody, wills & estates, etc).  At one time we had like 8 clients getting divorced after 20+ years of marriage and they were all high ranking military men whose wives came out of the closet after all their kids had grown up and moved out of the house and the guys were getting ready to retire.  I thought it was so weird, but I guess for whatever reason the women thought that their duties to their husbands and families were coming to an end and they wanted to live for themselves.  I guess I know why they couldn't come out 30 years ago, it was a different time but I was curious why they were all attracted to military guys?  I assume maybe cause it meant their husbands would be away for years at a time during their service?",
            "My parents split up after nearly 30 years. My dad was an asshole my entire life, so when they finally divorced when I was 18, there was no surprise. He\u2019d been cheating for years and I think he was the one who finally asked for it. \n\nI think my mom stayed because she couldn\u2019t afford to start over. She spent her life putting my dad through school and wasn\u2019t educated herself. She had no family or anyone who could help her either. There was definitely some confidence issues on her part too."

I told him about the train interaction and it turned out I was the last person to have seen him - no one else had seen him since the party, including his roommates. they eventually found a note in his apartment that read something like \"I am fine but don't try to find me\"\n\nseveral weeks go by with no word from the younger brother.

I was late for dinner and I knew my mum would be mad but when I walked past my aunties something was screaming at me to go inside. My Aunty kept saying she was so happy to see me and was dressed up like she was going on a date or something. Which I found strange because she was only hanging round at home. We chatted for a bit and was saying some very odd things, \u201ctell such and such this\u201d, \u201ctell so and so I love them\u201d. She told me to take whatever I wanted from her house and her pantry and fridge were completely emptied out which I thought was weird. The whole thing made my hair stand up but I was just a kid and didn\u2019t understand what was going on. When I eventually left to go home she teared up, gave me a big hug, said she loved me and was so glad I came by. The next day no one in the family could reach her. The curtains were all pulled at her house and the phone line was cut. After eventually breaking in, my grandma discovered she had hung herself in the closet. Everyone in the family wondered why she didn\u2019t leave a note. After 3 years of repressing that memory it resurfaced and I realised that I was the note. Fucked me up for a long time.",

We hang out for like a week, and he\u2019s continuing on eastward, and I was going west.  Like two days later his flight crashed in the Himalayas near Nepal, all 200+ people on board died.  I wasn\u2019t the last person to see him, but was the last person from our home who did.  After it happened, I wrote a long letter to his parents and family telling them about our week together on Santorini, and sent some pictures of us- these would be the last pictures his family had of him.

I was done.  A few months later, I decided to reach out.  She had moved out of her apartment and disconnected her phone (back then we just had landlines.)  I heard from a mutual friend she had moved back in with her dad.  \n\nI called her and apologized.  I asked her to have a beer with me to catch up.  She told me she had stopped drinking, so we met for coffee instead.  The argument had really affected her.  She decided to do better.  She quit drinking, moved home and re-enrolled.  I told her I was proud of her and asked if everything was cool at home (her dad had a history of abuse.)  She told me it was good and we promised to keep in touch.  \n\nI woke up to the police knocking on my apartment door.  They found her body a few blocks from her dad's house.  I was the second to last person to see her alive.  They questioned me.  Her car was in her father's driveway.  That son of a bitch beat her to death and dumped her body like trash.  \n\nThe police were unable to arrest him right away and he died in the parking lot of a local bar a week later.

To be fair, there are laws prohibiting minors from working too long or too late and honestly I didn\u2019t mind it as the food was incredible. \n\nAfter about a year I\u2019m now 16 and due to the minimal wait staff I was expected to work as a waiter/busboy in between dishes.

            "A guy I know constsantly looked so tired and napped all the time during the day.  He would nap so hard that you would have to shake him to wake him up, and he could fall asleep anywhere super fast.  I asked him about it and he told me he felt tired all the time because he couldn't sleep at night, he figured he just had insomnia or something but refused to go to a doctor about it.  One day he had a legit mental breakdown after a few drinks, we basically had to babysit him all night and I'm convinced it was because of his constantly exhausted state. \n\nNot long after that incident he went to the doctor about his sleep and it turns out he had been living with sever sleep apnea for years.  The doctor told him he was basically on the verge of a heart attack or stroke because of it.  Now he sleeps with a special mask at night and he has completely changed for the better.  He visibly has way more  emergy and his performance in school  went through the roof.  \n\nEdit: I have got tons of comments from this post saying it inspired people to go have an appointment with a doctor, to which I say good!  I can't stress enough how much getting treatment helped my friend.  It's fortunate such a debilitating condition has such an effective and immediate treatment available for it, so by all means go check it out! Take care.",
            "Worked with a guy at AutoZone that had two set of kids and two sets of child support payments.  He worked 40 hours with us and then 30-40 at a grocery store just killing himself to survive.  Turns out that he was like 9 hours away from a degree he had begun a decade earlier and he just randomly mentioned it to a coworker while they were stocking things.  The managers at both stores knew his situation and worked his schedule together to get him the hours he needed.  They started a tuition fund that anyone could donate to and both sat him down to say he needed to finish his school.  The school put together a pre-req class for him, which he made an A in, and off he went one class at a time.  One year later he walked the stage with a marketing degree and turned his whole life around at 41 or 42.",
            "I had a friend that had an addictive personality. He was incredibly smart but liked to party too much. During junior year of high school he got in a car accident, broke some bones, and got addicted to the pills he was prescribed. He spiraled downwards after that and barely made it out of high school. Most people lost contact with him and thought he would just be another lowlife.\n\nA few years after high school one of our mutual friends committed suicide and he took it very harshly, but it was enough to change his attitude. He took up an interest in investments and decided to move away from his burnout friends to attend a college. He graduated in less than 4 years and ended up working for a reputable bank earning six figures, and now he's always posting his luxurious vacations on facebook, it was a crazy turn around for him.",

After a stint being locked up and getting clean he stopped talking to anyone from that group. No communication whatsoever, cold turkey. Lived with his mom, found a job he could walk to since his driver's license was long gone, and started getting in shape physically. He did counseling, broke his heroin habit, got into martial arts as a positive outlet for his energy. Talking to him now, he says breaking contact with all those people was the only way he made it out.",
            "About 5 years ago I started doing this little mental trick... if there was some small thing I needed to do I just counted to 3 in my head and did it. Stuff like \"1,2,3: put on my workout clothes\", \"1,2,3: empty the dishwasher\", \"1,2,3: answer that email\", \"1,2,3: turn the TV off\".\n\nI promised myself that every \"1,2,3\" would be something I could achieve in less than 10 minutes, and that I would never fail to do something once I finished the countdown. I was amazed at how many of life's problems were solved by overcoming those little moments of inertia during the day.\n\nMy level of motivation before and after that shift was night and day.

We would drive around in the evening looking for stores that still had trees sitting out front.  Nine times out of 10, when we would ask about the tree we were interested in, they would say \u201cjust take it,\u201d glad to get rid of them by that point. \n\nEvery year we had a perfectly beautiful tree and it was exciting to find perfect trees for free and then stay up late decorating it with home-made glitter pine cones and candy canes.",

            "Libraries can save your life. \n\nThe first part of my childhood I would get home from school, usually to a vacant house. I really wouldn\u2019t know if I was even going to see either of my parents each night. No cell phones of course. But I was always afraid... nervous at least, of what would happen if they did decide to make an appearance.\n\nI started walking to the library everyday after school and staying till they closed every night just to avoid the feeling of anxiety for a little longer. Eventually one of the librarians noticed and took a liking to me. I think she might have been through similar things in her life that she saw in me. Gradually we got to know each other. First I started noticing there were more books being added in the genres that I liked. Then one day after the library closed, I walked over to McDonald\u2019s. I was a quarter or so short to buy a hamburger and she saw me asking people if they had any change. I saw her and was embarrassed and kinda hid from her. From that point on I think she decided that she was going to take me under her wing. For over a year she would come by my desk at the library and just drop off chips, granola bars, pop, whatever you know? Of course, I would tell her I didn\u2019t need it, when in reality I only knew where one meal would come from each day. When I would ask her where it came from, she would just say it was extras from the break room, even though I could hear her in there putting coin after coin into the vending machine. Eventually she would just bring dinner every night to the library and we would sit down in the break room with each other and eat. I finally opened up to her about my family/living issues and had her to talk to. Even though I was still pretty guarded, this was a huge relief. THEN, after I had been there almost 2 years, it was the week before school started, and I headed into the library. Before I left she told me to meet her outside after close. I did, we walked to her car, and she pulled out a brand new school backpack, and inside was a new outfit, binder, and shoes (my first Nikes). That\u2019s when I broke down, and my walls crumbled. She was a single lady working off a librarians income, but she still made room for me.\n\nFor 3 years she supported me as much as she could, and she was more of a friend than I had ever experienced up until that point in my life. She is the number 1 reason I got out of that house and life. She was with me at all my adoption hearings, and made sure I was put with a nice family. She was at my graduation, and my wedding. She saw me grow up and succeed in life after coming from the bottom. She saw her work and love pay off. I went to her funeral this summer and it felt like I had lost my mother, but I couldn\u2019t stop reflecting on how much she changed my life through her sacrifice. \n\n Truly an amazing person, and I still donate to the library every year.\n\nEdit: So I\u2019ve only really been active on Reddit for a couple months. I think this is how you\u2019re supposed to do this though..\n\nIt\u2019s really cool for me to see that this affected people. I wrote it, and just expected/intended it to kind of disappear into the other 15k comments, and sometimes it just feels good writing stuff out. So just to level with everyone, I only talk to my closest friends about this in my real life. So let\u2019s label this a mini therapy session, if you will. \n\nThanks to everyone for the Platinum/Gold/silver.

            "Oh god I have a really bad story for this \n\nI used to drive a taxi for my uncles company. A guy gets in my taxi, says \"just follow that car\" and reassures me its nothing serious. Except when the other car stops, he gets out and runs to the car we were following and drags the guy out and starts hitting him in the face, hard. I got out and was yelling at him and calling him an asshole for lying to me, and he got all in my face and threatened to beat the shit out of me too, said a bunch of racist slurs at me, then ran off. \n\nThe guy who got punched had his nose broken. The weirdest part is that he had no idea who that guy was.",
            "[removed]",
            "Not entirely related, but I once had somebody jump into my car and I wasn't even a taxi.\n\nI was driving down the street in Boston and was stopped at a red light, minding my own business.  Suddenly, my passenger door flung open and someone climbed in.  Completely shocked, I didn't even have time to react.  For some reason it never entered my mind that I should be alarmed or concerned about this trespasser, so when I saw that it was an elderly lady I just remained calm.  Without skipping a beat, she said in a thick Russian accent, \"you take me home, please.\"  So, I started driving.\n\nI asked where she lived but she just said \"keep going, I tell you when to stop.\"  At that point it dawned on me that she probably had dementia and that she likely thought I was someone she knew, or maybe even a taxi.  Nope.  After a few minutes of conversation it was abundantly clear that this woman had simply picked the first car she saw, gotten in, and requested a ride.  During the 10-minute car ride she asked about my life.  I was in college studying psychology at the time, and when I told her this she said \"you make good psychologist, very nice boy.\"  It put a big smile on my face.  My grandparents had all died either before I was born or during early childhood, so I don't think I had ever had an elderly person say something like that to me.  It felt nice.\n\nFinally we reached an apartment building and she told me to pull over.  When I put the car in park she turned to me and said \"thank you driving me today.\"  I assured her it was no problem at all and wished her the best, and her parting words to me as she climbed out were \"very good boy, good luck with studies.\"  After pausing for a moment, I drove away and just kind of let it be.  It was such a nonchalant and comfortable interaction that I resisted my temptation to immediately text friends to tell them what had happened.  It felt like that would have cheapened it, or turned it into a novelty.  It was just so natural and I went with it.\n\nShe's unlikely to be alive at this point, but I hope she enjoyed the rest of her days.  Godspeed, Russian-grandma-I-had-for-a-day.",
            "I'm actually a taxi driver (bike taxi/pedicab). I was hanging out a corner when a coworker of mine got a ride across the intersection. \n\nSuddenly a guy walks up to me and tells me to \"follow that cab, but keep a distance\". This guy looked current or ex military: demeanor, haircut, attitude... has one of those earbuds like the agents from the Matrix. Exuded the vibe of being very professional/competent and not giving a fuck at the same time. \n\nSo I was born for this moment. I read all the Tom Clancy books as a kid, all the books about spycraft during WWII and the cold war, every spy movie ever made, etc. I kept about 100 yards distance and then would accelerate when they went around a curve anytime they were near a light or intersection (I have all the lights memorized) to ensure we would make the same light but a little later than they did. At one point a car pulls up alongside and another guy switches places with the original guy and we keep going. After about 12 blocks the pedicab pulls over ahead of us and the guy tells me to pull over. Hands me $20 for a $12 ride, although I would have done it for free just to live my 9 year old fantasy. \n\nProbably just local cops, but I can dream",
            "Ooh I\u2019m not a taxi driver, but I was the passenger for a story that is similarly clich\u00e9d.\n\nBack when I was an actor/active drug addict/alcoholic (what\u2019s the difference, I know) I had a director threaten to recast me a week before the show if I was late to rehearsal again. To put that into perspective, recasting a major role after rehearsals have started is generally unheard of, and almost unthinkable so late in the rehearsal process. She was REALLY fed up with me.\n\nOn this particular day, I was running late as usual and had five minutes to get to rehearsal. It was a 10 minute walk or a 5 minute drive.\n\nI flagged a cab, hopped in and said \u201cI need you to take me to this address and, if you can, I need you to step on it.\u201d\n\nThe driver smiled wide and said \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to hear that.\u201d\n\nCue him putting the pedal to the metal. Within 10 seconds we were approaching 65MPH on a 30MPH city street, weaving through traffic, clipping yellow lights too close for comfort, and generally whipping this cab around in an extraordinarily haphazard and irresponsible fashion. I was stunned; wide-eyed; in absolute shock and terror; unable to process that he quite literally heeded my request or that this was actually happening. I thought I was going to die. It was the best cab ride of my life.\n\nI was two minutes early to rehearsal.",

We ended up in a parking lot and we watched them go into an apartment building.  Cabbie had the station call the cops. I wrote a statement for the cabbie and he called me a new cab while he wanted for the cops.",
            "Friend of mine is a taxi driver and this has happened to him. An elderly man rushed inside his taxi and pointed out loud to follow a red Toyota. This man never explains why to follow, just tries to franticly call to somewhere. My friend asked multiple times if they need to call police but the man just waved no and pointed to follow the car. They circle around the town finally ending up to a front of a house where the car followed parks. As the car stop, man says \"Hold on a moment, I'll pay!\" and jumps out of the car. An elderly lady steps out of the red Toyota and the man, apparently her husband, starts to scream \"Why did you left me at the mall??!!\". Woman is waving her hands screaming back \"What are you screaming about, you are here??!!\" and walks inside the house like nothing has happened. Man returns  and pays the drive, being sorry about it all at the same time.\n\nMy friend thought they were following a burglar or something, but it turned out the lady just forgot her husband at the mall. Funny situation in a way, but sad in a way too as my friend said. Dementia...\n\nEdit: sleepy typos",
            "I did that once as a passenger. We said it as a joke. We were in a group of 6 and couldn't fit in a single cab.

            "My time to shine.\n\nI used to work at a printing press that also duplicated/replicated discs; meaning, all of that physical inventory you see in stores like DVD's, and CD's were made by us - BUT...we were cheaper than most places, so unsigned bands were our proverbial bread and butter. I had the privilege of listening to some of the most amazing music that flew under the radar. Here's a dump of great underdogs, some were done by us, but most are just merely criminally underrated. I don't endorse any of these bands, and haven't worked at the press for nearly 5 years.\n\n\n[Brick + Mortar *Seven Years in the Mystic Room*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTj_16nI8g0) - Experimental Rock/HipHop - You might have heard their cover of Jimi Hendrix on the Hitman soundtrack, but all of their albums are fucking stunning.\n\n[RX Bandits *Gemini, Her Majesty*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh3YBr5q9A&list=PLY944k5l1aEAGtjQb_VFuHWool6MQU4rl) - Experimental rock/ska - Insanely talented band that I've seen live without knowing who they are. They're directly connected to one of my other favorite bands listed below, The Sound of Animals Fighting which has the addition of Circa Survive/Saosin Vocalist Anthony Green.\n\n[The Sound of Animals Fighting *The Ocean and the Sun*](https://youtu.be/t3o4mI_we-w?t=42) - They get weird, real weird. But this is their last album, and probably their most normal album as their previous two had weird interludes, but the songs are fantastic on all three albums. Insanely underrated band.\n\n[Midlake *The Courage of Others*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL966A18A46DF49050) - Stoner folk/reminiscent to Fleet Foxes but with more somber toned vocals. Just fucking listen to this goddamn album, it's beautiful.\n\n [IllScarlett *All Day With It*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL115D5B0EB29637DA) - Stoner Ska, but a very talented Canadian band. Catchy tunes, and I realllllly fucking wish I could locate my physical copy of this album as it's difficult to find their tunes on YT.\n\n[The Mountain Goats *Tallahassee*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rwLkEpxSC0&list=PL68EF2BAA7E6782C4) - Gut wrenching and beautiful lyrics. Folk music.\n\n[MeWithoutYou *Catch For Us the Foxes*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDKlKOP6fDI) - Drop what you're doing, and listen to this goddamn album while reading each and every gorgeous lyric. Seriously has one of the best lyricists of the past few decades, the dude is a goddamn marvel that has some serious anguish in his voice.\n\n[Levi Weaver *The Letters of Dr. Kurt G\u00f6del*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5NgHvDebZo) Insanely talented folk/experimental musician, and sensational songwriter. I wish I could find more of his music, but this is one of the songs from that album. [He also does a kickass cover of Radiohead's *Idioteque*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA8-NX_LW7A)\n\n[Authority Zero *A Passage in Time*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPH9NGNviO0) Ska/Rock Just a great fucking album, and makes me think of Tony Hawk Pro Skater.\n\n[Reid Willis *Born of Kaleidoscope*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhx2gseZNxI) - Ambient/Electronic This album is fantastic, as is all his work, but his music is also difficult to track down.\n\n[Patrick Sweany *Every Hour is a Dollar Gone*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqTFga1IOjY&list=PLL04X9v_QXgE820r1Y89JkLL-oFWqv3Ij) - Rock and Roll/Blues. This dude has passion, and is incredibly talented, but sadly doesn't get noticed frequently. This album was produced by Dan Auerbach from The Black Keys.\n\n[Pegasus Dream *In Abesntia*](https://soundcloud.com/pegasusdream/sets/rootmusic-bandpage-1) - Practically no views, very few listens, this is basically underground and I can't figure out why as it's a very well done dream-pop album. I hate pop...Why the fuck do I love this album...\n\n[Walking Oceans *Dear Isaac*](https://soundcloud.com/terrence-vitali/sets/walking-oceans-dear-isaac) Ambient instrumental - Incredibly well put together music, with virtually no views on sound cloud. I had this album on nonstop repeat at my desk for the entire duration of their project. On par with Explosions in the Sky, in my opinion.\n\n[Radiation 4 *Wonderland*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccHNTriMSrE&list=PL851BD6D1D5E73A79) Experimental metal/math metal/circus metal - I don't even know where to begin. If you enjoy metal music, give this album a shot, it's ridiculously amazing. It seems they've taken influence from Mr. Bungle, and Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, but seem to be a bit more grounded (emphasis on \"a bit\"). Vocalist likes to use sound effects on his voice occasionally, which works very well with the circus vibe of their sound.\n\n[Ellen Sundberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XmOeJy6RmE) - Country/folk rock - I think my guitar mentor actually produced this album, which is the only reason why I know of her because I think she's from Iceland or something, but she's damn good. I really dislike country, but she leans more towards folk and has just the right amount of twang.\n\n[Keaton Henson *Dear*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02L2geOMGc) Actually reminds me a bit of Scout Niblett, and I'm not sure why. Just a dude and his guitar, very soft-spoken, and heartbroken. \n\n[Sorne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izb7R04_Heg) - Have no idea how to explain this dude. He's got really cool music videos, and his music is pretty amazing, but I can't categorize it's genre for the life of me. I jam to this song very frequently, and always watch the video in its entirety.\n\n[Black Books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh69anIXeGE) - Sound very reminiscent to Band of Horses. This is my favorite song of theirs, but this video absolutely rips my heart out of my chest.\n\n[Polica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz3WUEl_qHk) - Two drummers, a bassist, and a vocalist with a beautiful voice that uses  effects. Fairly poppy, but she's got some great lyrics, and the entire album of *Give You the Ghost* is fantastic. [Wandering Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX4iIPlwS5c) is my favorite song by them, and the video is fantastic.\n\n[Joanna Newsom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQIGraR3aI) Lovely voice, if not quirky, and plays harp beautifully. She's also married to Andy Samberg\n\n[Jesse Stewart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEvQOPUHGH8) Dude with a mandolin plays his heart out, but really love every one of his songs. He's a bit unorthodox, but he's got sincere passion in every one of his songs.\n\n[Hyro Da Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE4hdJphnao) - Hip hop/rap they're all cookie cutter IMO, that rely on a typical beat. Not this dude. I believe the band members, or at least one(?), are from the hardcore group *The Blood Brothers*. Not huge on rap, but I really dig this guy, and the music packs a fucking punch.\n\n[The Claypool Lennon Delirium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCpJUyAibew) - Les Claypool of *Primus* and John Lennon's son Sean Lennon. Good god this album is good, but very kooky which is to be expected because Les Claypool is an absolute nut.\n\n[Sunny Day Real Estate *How it Feels to be Something On*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcdghI0e7S0&t=1535s) - Incredible indie band from my childhood that doesn't get the recognition they deserve.\n\n[The Appleseed Cast *Two Conversations*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U0bllvJUyQ&t=1085s) - Amazing indie band with conservative use of vocals, but the music is stellar.\n\n[Megafauna *Maximalist*](https://soundcloud.com/megafauna/sets/maximalist) Fantastic rock and roll. The old physical CD I had of theirs broke, and these soundcloud tracks seem to have been re-recorded/remastered as a few of my favorite tracks are missing, and it sounds completely different. \n\n[COLOUR REVOLT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQqB4ri5_5c&list=PLXp4edtig0vSgJE6R5Vf8Tj5ELt_Yw6V8) - Rock/Indie Rock - They have 3 albums, and they're all incredible. Easily one of my favorite bands of all time, but are criminally underrated. The lead vocalist put out a very chill album under a different name listed below, and it's so goddamn good.\n\n[El Obo *Oxford Basement Collection*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSZm6DBXkTU) Vocalist Jesse Coppenbarger for Colour Revolt released this experimental acoustic album. There are some serious Flaming Lips vibes on a few tracks. Incredible.\n\n[Mad Gregs *Relatives*](https://soundcloud.com/mad-gregs-band) This album is an organized clusterfuck that is beautifully executed. When four talented multi-instrumentalists get together with a classical background, beautiful things happen. Heavy jazz influences, with some 80's pop undertones, experimental, and somehow has a Flaming Lips vibe in some areas, so they're probably the 2nd most polarizing on this list (next to Radiation 4). I'd start with track 8 - [Holiday Pearl](https://soundcloud.com/mad-gregs-band/08-holiday-pearl-1) which is just fantastic.\n\n[Dr. Dog *Fate*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgaj0LHnJXE) Probably the closes we're going to get to The Beatles during this generation, and they have multiple singers just like the Beatles as well. Great album with incredibly talented musicians. Old school rock and roll from young musicians. [Here's their Tiny Desk Concert starter pack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzmvzcDWZjI) in case you're uncertain whether you want to dive into their extensive discography.\n\n[Dinosaur Jr. *Farm*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfSo840sTmI&list=PLFgtLCsn09X3qCEKh9SuPdE4xChLwUKlJ) Rock and Roll. Great album with great musicians. This band and Dr. Dog are what I refer to as \"commercial underground\". They're signed, but don't get the recognition they deserve. ",

It's a full show, almost two hours, and they play some of their best stuff. You can literally skip to any part of this video and it will be incredible.

Exactly one year ago today, we finally headed to the NICU with our \"perfectly healthy, just sleepy\" baby daughter who'd been discharged from labor and delivery a week before.

Somehow this didn't set off any red flags during our two-day stay in the hospital after her birth. We were discharged and told that she was just \"sleepy\" because she was born at 37 weeks. \n\nWell, we ended up dripping milk down her throat for an entire week, waiting for her to \"come around.\" We took her to the pediatrician, had a home health nurse come, had a lactation consultant come... They all said the same thing. 37 weeks, sleepy, she'll get the hang of it, blah blah blah. I had been airing my concerns to anyone who would listen before she was even born. She NEVER moved in utero, only a wiggle every now and then to let me know she wasn't dead (yet). \"All pregnancies are different, all babies are different, blah blah blah...\" Well, one year ago today, I had a screaming breakdown to my husband: \"SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS BABY AND YOU KNOW IT.\" He still wanted to believe everything would be okay, but he agreed to take her to the NICU.\n\nAaaaaand she was alternating between seizure and coma every 3-5 seconds, a \"burst-suppression pattern\" on EEG (look it up for a fun read) with a completely non-functioning brain. She developed and was born that way by some cruel and nonsensical twist of fate. Ohtahara Syndrome. 1 in 100,000 odds. She died two weeks later.

I get home just before 5pm. \n\nIf a holiday falls on my day off, then we get to bank 8 hours of vacation. if it falls on a work day, then 8 hours are free and I have to use 2 hours from my vacation bank. The company off sets this by giving you 1 extra hour of vacation every 2 weeks if you are on 10 hours days. \n\nAlso once a year we shut down for maintenance. 30-60 days. that is when the fun starts. we work 6 days a week 12 hours days the entire shut down. its all or nothing you either work it or turn it all down and they hire a temporary additional to make up for the lost time.\n\nIf they need us to work overtime we work an extra day (5-10s) get 50 hours for the week and still get 2 days off.",

            "At my work place it goes some what differently.\n\nThe Boss wants us to work 10 hr a day Monday to Thursday and then 10 again on Friday. We have the choice whether we come in on the weekend. ",
            "If those were the only choices, yes.  But along with those two options, my job has a third option of 9 hours Monday-Thursday and 8-hours every other Friday which I find a happy medium that allows me to get frequent three day weekends and still allows me time to workout on workdays.",
            "Absolutely. Those days would be longer, but I could do so much more with regular 3-day weekends than 2-day ones. ",
            "Definitely. It's an extra day off! Days already ruined by having to work, so what's 2 hours more per day?"

            "there\u2019s so much i can barely even get anything out. i was in foster care from age 6 to 18 and it was the absolute worst thing that ever happened to me. the foster care system is deeply flawed and literally took me and my siblings\u2019 entire childhood away from us because of their lack of ability to give a single shit about us foster kids as human beings. they trust deeply in the foster parents more than the kids. we all showed very clear signs of being abused. we had no medical records because we were never taken to the doctors or even a dentist. a simple investigation would\u2019ve shown we were being mistreated in multiple ways. but they trusted my foster parent\u2019s mischievous smile instead because it meant they didn\u2019t have to put the effort into looking into it, moving us to new homes, and losing what they considered to be a \u201cgood\u201d foster home. \n\ni told my foster worker to her face every detail of the abuse, physical and emotional, that was in that home. she told me there was nothing she could do. nothing. it\u2019s been 6 years and that crazy bitch is still a foster parent. she recently had a toddler taken away from her because they found her boarded up into a room, literal boards nailed into the wall. and guess what? she\u2019s still a foster parent. \n\nCFS/CPS does not care about kids, their families, or anything that should be important about the foster care system. they make money, they get \u201ctroubled\u201d kids out of their hair, and they pretend not to see what is right in front of them so that they don\u2019t have to do their jobs\u2014 not all the social workers are like this, but enough that it\u2019s a huge problem.",
            "I got really, *really* lucky and was placed with a decent family that didn't treat me like a second-class citizen.  I was family.  I've seen horror stories of other places where kids starve or are mistreated in their homes.  I had the best possible situation and I won't deny that at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever.. It's still so much to deal with as a small child.  Remember when you were a kid and you cried when left at the babysitters?  Imagine going to live at the babysitter's house.  My mom wasn't a bad mom.. she was a troubled woman trying to get away from an abuser.  I was in the home for about half a decade.. which is an eternity as a small kid.  At 10, half my life had been split between two moms and I wasn't sure what I was allowed to feel.  When I finally went back home would my real mom be upset that I missed my foster mom?  Should I talk about missing my old school?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe home I stayed at also had upwards of four foster kids at a time, who shuffled in and out.  A bunch of kids from ages 3-16 who had been through some horrendous stuff.  And there I was, a broken kid surrounded by other broken kids.  It's a hell of an environment, no matter how good the parents are.",
            "My mom starting doing foster care when I was in middle school. She was a single mother who already had 6 of her own kids, so it was clear to see that she loved children. \n\nWhen I was a senior in high school she adopted her first foster child, a little girl who came directly to us at 8 days old from the hospital fighting drug addiction. \n\nA year and a half later, we had 2 more foster children, a brother and sister, whose parents were in and out of shelters, because they kept robbing others and being kicked out. They still had visitation rights for about a year and a half before one of them came back with a burn on her arm. After that, my mom adopted them as well.\n\nThen, my mom got a call that the first child we adopted had a 1 year old brother in the system... you probably know where this is going... we adopted him as well. \n\nAbout 3 years later, my mom got word that their mother had another child in prison and before they could even ask, we took her in too. She was a little less than a year at the time, but before she turned 3 we had adopted her as well increasing the family total to 11.\n\nMost people I talk to tell me mom is a saint. I always respond with, \u201cshe\u2019s either that or insane\u201d. What I do know is that 3 months ago I watched my 13 year old sister, who I remember holding while she wrapped tightly in a blanket shaking at 8 days old, sing somewhere over the rainbow as the Dorothy in her middle school play. All I could do not to cry was tell myself that I was sitting front row and she could see me. Then, in the same week I watched my 11 year old brother win another wrestling tournament, after which I had to flex on him, to keep him humble. \n\nIn the end they are all happy, healthy, and when I come home to visit they all run to give me a hug and welcome me back. If you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re in the system now and feel like you\u2019re in a bad place, I want you to know that there are people out there who will love you and take you in as family.

            "Just don't be a dick. Don't get rid of their personal belongings without speaking to them---sometimes a ratty shirt or a torn up backpack is all they have left of home.  \n\nA lot of foster youth have experienced trauma that may or may not affect their behaviors which is something you have to acknowledge and understand. When a kid does something that seems to make little sense analyze their actions and try to determine what is going on rather than jumping to the conclusion that the kid is bad or that they are trying to upset you.\n\nAdditionally, speaking of 'bad' kids: when working with multiple kids don't idolize one and speak poorly of the others. And don't make assumptions.\n\nI was a 'good' kid. I didn't get into trouble and was quiet and got good grades. When I was older, however, they struggled to find a placement. Once I 'interviewed' for a home (I mean, kind of, the social worker just brought me to a house to meet the family) but when the family met me they flat out said, openly, that I couldn't live there because, as a foster youth, I would clearly try to seduce their son (15-16ish) despite the fact that I was 12 (I think) and had no history of acting out sexually. When I did get placements because I was 'good' the foster parent/s would often speak poorly about the other children to me or around me. When they had guests they would claim themselves martyrs of the bad kids while putting me on a pedestal. While they may have thought they were helping me or raising my confidence it did not help me trust them and certainly didn't help the kids they bitched about.\n\nEDIT: TBF, a lot of foster kids act out sexually, even from a young age due to abuse or due to seeing sexual attraction as a form of love and reaching out for anything.\n\nEDIT: Another edit, just to thank you all for your support and the almost complete kindness and respect in this thread. \n\nI also want to mention a family that truly sticks in my head because I love them and the memory of them and want someone else to know of their goodness (and want to bring more happiness to this thread). I stayed with a respite care family when my foster family went on vacation and these people were the bomb. They were older, lived in a wonderful relaxing place, and were sensitive to my 'quirks' to the point where I did not feel scared or apprehensive after the first day. I don't remember their names but wish I could. But they told me they couldn't take in foster kids anymore (they were quite old) but every weekend they took in a new respite kid and that they focused on kids that they thought needed more care (I was a young teen so they probably knew it was hard for me to find a placement). So they had me for a few days and they took me to the store to buy me foods I liked and took me to a historical site and let me near their pets (a lot of my families must have heard horror stories of abusive foster youth and wouldn't let me near their pets or kids) and just...nourished me for the few days I was there. When I left they told me I could call them if I ever felt unsafe in my placement which I regret never doing. Point is, there are good foster care providers. There are good people. And they were a few of them.",
            "I went into foster care at 16. \n\nMy mom had been beating me to the point of breaking bones for years. I have an elementary school pic where I have a black eye from her. I do not know why my mom doesn't like me. She started beating me when I was 4 so I don't think it was me. When I went into high school it got a lot worse. She started checking my hymen every month or so to make sure that it was still intact. She was obsessed with the idea that I was a slut despite never kissing a boy. I was raped when I was 16 and my mom had my dad drop me off at the youth homeless shelter that I usually stayed at but this time they refused to pick me up. CPS had known about the abuse for over 9 years and never did anything. My parents are rich and white, my dad is a government official. My mom was so abusive that cps had asked her to complete a parenting class when I was 13. She got kicked out the first week for bullying the instructor and the other parents. Cps still did nothing literally until they refused to get me. \n\nNow that you know my background know that every foster kid has a tragic story. It might look different but no matter what the situation that leads to being separated is traumatizing.I already had complex ptsd at that point. I didn't act out. I was the type to freeze and fold in on myself. I never hated others I only hated myself. I was weird but it was because I had been so neglected. I didn't know how to shower properly or brush my teeth and I ate with my hands sometimes. \n\nI lived in the shleter for a few months until I was placed two hours away in a town I had never been in. My foster mom was deeply religious and heavily involved in her church, in fact, the foster agency that I was placed through had a mandatory religion policy. My first day there I forgot the foster moms name. I was told to just call her mom instead. It made me feel sick but if I called her by her first name the family would get mad at me. When I asked if I needed to go to church I was told that if I didn't I wouldn't work out in the family. Church was really triggering because that is what led to my moms sex crusades.I was to afraid to be displaced. Once an older kid is displaced they often don't get placed again. Displacing also always puts you up to the risk of being abused worse. 60% of the underage sex trafficking industry is fueled directly from foster care.\n\nI threw myself into religion. The church taught that god sometimes has to break someone in order for them to finally follow him. I remember laying at the alter sobbing begging god to forgive me and decide that I had been broken enough. The other foster kids were quickly reunified so I was alone. \n\nThe church gave my foster mom an excellent way to abuse us. Her bio kids always came first. Her daughter who was in the same grade went to mission trips abroad every break so all the money my foster mom got through fostering went to that and spoiling her other child. She only got $600 a month for me so she needed the church to help make sure that she didnt need to spend it on me. Her house was provided by a church member. I had to eat different food that was donated through church. There was one church member who donated a costco sized bag of tortilla chips and they were all stale so I would have to microwave them and then just eat that every day until that bag was gone. All my clothing was donated through the church. I didn't get new shoes or undergarments for over half a year. The entire year and a half that I lived with her she only gave me $50 for clothing and thats when I got shoes and underwear. I didn't get a backpack or a nice shirt.When my foster mom decided she didnt want to work anymore she told the church that she needed to quit her job to take care of me because after all foster kids are a handful. The church members started paying her to clean their houses instead. I started being starved. My foster mom would only feed me if someone else besides her and her youngest daughter were home. Her older bio daughter stopped coming home around that time so I wasn't able to eat outside of lunch, even on the weekend. Her daughter use to just be passive but she actively started taunting me around this time. I was treated as an idiot. It was just assumed that I was the dumb one and her bio daughter was the smart lovely christian girl. I never said anything because I wasn't sure if it was abuse or not.\n\nOn the outside everything looked great. My foster mom was a enthusiastic church member, heavily involved in the community. She had to quit her job to take care of the foster kid who is acting so bad that she needed to be there 24/7. Her daughter that was my age was well behaved, went on mission trips regularly and never had sex. I also fit the part. I was failing my classes, I ate with my hands and I was missing a lot of everyday knowledge because I had never been taught. I had been arrested for shop lifting underwear and food. The underwear was a thong so I was seen as the ultimate charity project.\n\nFinally One day after starving me for over three months she picked me up from school and told me that god had let her see where my mom was coming from and thats why she had been starving me. She dropped me off at therapy and I told my therapist that part and I was removed a few days later. The home that I was placed in afterwards was a social workers house. She had just completed her masters and was actually volunteering at the shelter that I had originally lived in. Her husband was a retired marine. Their house was the same exact story.\n\nCPS attracts people who need to feel control. Wether that be sexual predators, abusers or neglecters. The people who would speak up against this injustice happen to be children. Very few of those who make it through choose to openly talk about it in public. On the surface the kids look terrible and thats all that society sees. They dont see the real reasons why the kids are behaving poorly. They rarely look at the foster parent.",
            "My husband and I were set to foster. We had done the classes, home study, everything. However, I was diagnosed with cancer and we were unable to complete, we were then denied when we reapplied when I was in remission.  \nI was able to join an organization that partners with foster teens who are aging out of the system to provide mentoring services. I am in HR and I help with resumes, interview prep, job seeking etc. I am also just an adult who is available to listen. There are ways to support the foster system if you are unable to foster a child. I am so grateful that I am allowed this opportunity!",
            "Had a pretty happy family until I was in high school. Played sports, oldest of my siblings, middle class family, no worries. Right before high school my mom and dad got divorced. We stayed with my mom and things went down hill from there. I ended up aging out of foster care.\n\nI think some of the most important things some people should realize is that supporting the child during foster care AND after they have aged out are key. I was lucky enough to be part of a program where they would give me a stipend every month as long as I was a full time student or working a full time job. I can't tell you how critical it was and how beneficial having that extra money to help buy a car, groceries, and an apartment was. Even with no family or safety net I ended up becoming a pretty good functioning member of society. \n\nI also want to add that Case workers are sometimes some of the greatest people on this earth and can really make or break a child's life. From placement into a home, to advocacy for you in family court, to showing you all the resources available to you as a state ward or foster child.\n\nThe last thing would be that being patient with someone who has gone through that is a big thing. I had no idea what a health romantic relationship looked like and had issues with that. Figuring out what a work ethic was, how important insurance was, how to get it, how to get a bank account. Basic every day life is not easy when you're constantly thinking about if you'll need to pack your things in a trash bag in 5 minutes to go to another house or not. So be patient, hold the the person the child or young adult accountable, and show some love. It'll make a huge difference.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add that vetting families or getting good ones is tough, but needed. The family I stayed with got paid $1500+ a month for my brother and I. All we had to eat though was ramen noodles, hot pockets, or whatever was left over from their grill outs. Most of the money they received would go to buying 100's of dollars of bbq food to cook for their friends every other day or weed. None of that wen to buying us new clothes, paying the $10 fees for us to at least play sports still, books, school supplies, toiletries. Nothing. Making sure that the money the families get are actually going to the children's needs would be a big step in the right direction.",

            "It's always felt like my parents never wanted me. I was a surprise Honeymoon baby born 9 months and a day after their wedding, I was regularly screamed at for anything I did until I just started hiding, I was called \"the practice child\" my whole life, my younger siblings got way more love and attention, etc. In my teens they started taking in \"strays\". If any neighborhood kids didn't want to go home, they could just be at our house all the time. Effectively, my mother would take my friends away from me to be *HER* friends instead. One of which was a kid who picked on me constantly from the time I was 11. I guess they had that in common.\n\nThat guy was kicked out of his Dad's house AND his mom's house when he was 20, so my parents took him in permanently. That killed me. But I always wanted their approval, so I was always calm and agreeable, always desperately trying to figure out how to get them to love me, so I went along with it. Years later, I'm married and have a son. This guy still lives with my parents. They continue to coddle and make excuses for him while criticising me for whatever they feel like. One day, we're all at my parents house and my son is being a goofy 2-year-old, which annoys the man-child living there. So he gets furious, picks my son up by his ankle and spanks him.\n\nMy parents claimed not to have seen it. We went home.\n\nI couldn't sleep that night because I was so upset. The next morning, I made sure the guy and my mom would be at home (and why wouldn't he be there) and I went to confront them with my wife. I dumped ***everything*** I had been putting up with on them for about an hour, including asking how my mom could allow this jerk to hit my son. She maintained that it didn't happen, so I went through the roof. I ended up crying because of all the pent-up emotion, so my fantastic wife took over. She said we wouldn't be coming back if the guy still lived there, so he yelled that he would move out and he stormed off after saying he didn't have to listen to this. My parents convinced him ***not*** to move out shortly after we left. My mother expressed how disappointed she was that I didn't come \"to have a conversation\", and only came to \"dump\" on them. ***THAT*** was her big takeaway from everything I said. That I wasn't being \"fair\" to them.\n\nWe went to counseling with them later. For months. It validated everything I had felt, but they never stopped lying and being defensive. One counselor said we should be on Dr. Phil. The other counselor said my mom is \"incapable of empathy\". Both counselors called my parents delusional. But of course my parents didn't take any of that seriously. At one point my dad asked me \"Who does he think he is to judge us like that?\", as if he forgot that THAT'S THEIR JOB.\n\nHaven't spoken with them in almost a year, and life is so much better.",

            "I can remember that day like it was yesterday...\n\nI was home packing my stuff to get ready for when my husband was out of basic training. \n\nI NEVER yell or even raise my voice to hardly anyone ever. \n\nMy dad has always had a wicked temper, and my sister also had a knack for starting yelling matches with him. \n\nOne night, she forgot to do something she was supposed to, and the yelling started again. I ignored it up until he called her stupid. It got under my skin so I spoke up a little saying that he shouldn't call her that. He hollered back, \"You are MY daughters, I can talk to you however I want!\" That's when I snapped.\n\nI saw red for the first time in my life, and I completely lost it. I screamed back at him at how I was tired of him treating us like garbage when he lost his temper, at how we hid in the back room with my mom until he cooled off, and how all I wanted was to visit my family before I had to move over 12 hours away from them. I also threatened that if he EVER wanted to see me again, then he needed to shut up and sit in the corner until he was done throwing a fit. \n\nI yelled at him for the first time in my life for a solid 30 minutes. I didn't stop until everything I had to say built over the years was out, and I saw him go from red-faced angry, to what seemed to be guilt-ridden. \n\nWhen I finally stopped, he was quiet. He didn't say a word and walked away. \n\nShortly after I moved out, he went to a doctor and has been put on some medication to help with his anger issues.\n\nNow he's super friendly, and I haven't heard him throw a tantrum like he used to in over 10 years now. He has never spoken poorly to me or my sister since then either. ",

I was very much pissed off at that point. It didn't help that they looked at me all innocent. I couldn't even tell which one of them did it. So I just stuck my finger in the face of the dude who's foot I allegedly stepped on and recommended he don't do it again. Turned around once more, waiting to get smacked in the head again. \n\nThis time they poured a glass of beer in my back. That's when I completely lost my shit. Threw myself around and went straight at the guy. I was in full rage mode, didn't care what happened next as long as that guy suffered. I could tell by the terrified look on his face he realized he had gone too far. His friends never stepped in to help him.

It never comes.\n\nUnfortunately I had forgotten about it until healthcare.gov sends me a message that they're going to raise my insurance costs if i don't get them the message in the next 2 weeks. So I call njfamilycare again and explain to them the situation. They once again claim they're going to send me the notice and don't. So now, after getting an extension from healthcare.gov about this I call up njfamilycare once more and attempt to explain the situation, politely requesting the cancellation notice. But the woman on the phone gets an attitude with me saying some stupid shit like \"UMMM, you know this is the cancellation department right?\" and I lost my shit. \n\n\"what the FUCK is your PROBLEM?! I don't understand why the FUCK you can't just send me this FUCKING LETTER. What's happening over there? Just look in the fucking file and CANCEL IT. Yes, you BITCH, I know this is the cancellation department, I WANT A NOTICE THAT IT'S CANCELLED.\" \n\nI must have scared the shit out of her because the next thing she said was \"... uh I'll go get my supervisor\" who solved the problem in 10 minutes and I got my cancellation notice 3 days later."

We were 5 years in and finally getting to settlement time. If we bought out his future medical, settlement pretty far into 6 figures. This guy was the sole provider for wife and 2 kids.\n\nThen we found out he had a aggressive brain cancer. Expected only couple years to live, at best.\n\nThus, we wouldn\u2019t buy out future medical anymore.

            "I do family law and I represented a father who had lost most of his custody from heroin use and imprisonment as a result.  He came to me saying he was clean and doing good and had his life together and it checked out.  He had been clean for almost nine months not counting jail time and seemed sincere in wanting to resume a full relationship with his son.  The other side fought viciously to keep him at extremely little custody and supervised at that, but we prevailed and got an order restoring fairly frequent unsupervised partial custody.\n\nNot long afterwards, only about three months after the case, he was back doing heroin, sold most of his furniture, and for me the most soul-crushing is that he set up a fake GoFundMe stuff for his child's \"cancer\" (his child didn't have cancer and has never had cancer so you know where that money was going).  I withdrew my appearance at this point so I don't know what happened afterwards, but I imagine and hope his custody was taken away.\n\nBasically the net result of winning that case was that the poor boy had to witness his father relapse on heroin and was exploited for money.

There's no way this doctor didn't know what had happened. The area of the burn was where he was operating on. It wasn't until I brought up settlement, because this was not a case we could win did he say, \"oh maybe I do know what happened.\" We ultimately settled that case, which is considered a favorable outcome considering the potential high monetary verdict.

            "I grew up in New Jersey and, despite living in Queens and working in Manhattan (NY public library) for 40 years, the Olive Garden was always my grandma's FAVORITE restaurant. In high school (2001-2005) I would take the bus into the city to see her once every month or two.. we'd get lunch and see a show or go to a museum. Almost every single time, we met at the Times Square Olive Garden. Honestly.. salad and breadsticks aren't bad. (Though there were a million other restaurants I'd rather have eaten as a 15-18 year old). ",
            "Went to college in NYC during Hurricane Sandy. With the power out for a few days after, my roommates and I went out looking for food and electricity (midtown still had power).  We convinced ourselves that the Times Square Olive Garden was a better option than fighting for outlets in an ATM vestibule. \n\n$25 for 4 hours of charging my phone, unlimited breadsticks, and drinks. Marginally worth it. 3/5 would do it again next hurricane.",
            "I can think of *one* good reason to eat there. If you have a reservation there on New Year's Eve you are allowed through the barricades to access the restaurant. Basically, you can party in Times Square for New Year's without having to spend the whole day there \"camping\". ",

I know this doesn't answer your question, but I've never told anyone I've pooped in there before and I needed at least one person to know. ",

I was very junior/entry level and I think that my boss really just wanted to let me go on the trip as a perk. Anyway, we had a variety of people in our class from other companies who wanted to go out to lunch. Olive Garden is relatively cheap and could seat a large group. We did the never ending soup salad and breadsticks lunch. At the time, I thought it was good. However, I've since realized that I had a corporate card and could have had a much better meal.",

As a Brit/Irish pair we were cramming in as much to the trip as we could.\nThe tickets were for the OG meal and drinks on NYE. It got us access to all of the closed streets getting to Times Square. We got to see the ball drop but were warm and had access to a toilet. \nJets game was vs. Miami Dolphins. I have no idea who won, but the experience was fun.

Right away I thought that was odd because my mum works a few towns over and even if she came home on her lunch break she\u2019d have to leave to go back by the time she got here but I thought maybe she had an appointment or something, so I asked my sister if she said anything. Here is what my sister says happened: She was upstairs in her room when she heard the front door unlock, so she walked over to the stairs to see who it was (the stairs were facing the front door so you could see it from the top of the stairs) and saw my mum taking her coat off and hanging it up. She looked over at my sister without saying anything after which my sister was just like oh ok it\u2019s just mum and went back to her room. She also didn\u2019t hear her leave. When she told me this I was pretty spooked because my mum wouldn\u2019t have NOT SAID A WORD, she\u2019d say Hi at the very least.

            "So, my Mom's dad died when she was two. My Grandmom never remarried, or dated, so my Mom grew up without a father figure in her life. It really affected her, in a way that's really hard to describe, and still does to this day. She talks about it a lot, and tends to be very dependent and fragile, I think because my Grandmom raised her VERY sheltered. \n\nMy Mom kind of has this obsession with her dad, and is constantly asking my Grandmom and other relatives about him, and what he was like, which is understandable, but still sad. He died a long time ago (50+ yrs), so she only has a handful of pictures of him, which she really cherishes, all black and white. One of these few pictures was a small, black and white picture of him sitting on a porch with his mom, aka my Mom's grandmother, or my great grandmother. \n\nIn the picture, they were seated about five feet apart from each other, each on one side of the picture. The picture itself was in a small frame, on the dining room, on top of this weird desk/cabinet thing. It was on a shelf pretty high up (~5.5 ft off the ground), and recessed by about two feet because of the desk. I note this to emphasize that it wasn't like on an end table or something- it wasn't easily accessed. Behind it in the frame was a baby picture of my brother (you know how people will put a picture in a frame over another one, but for whatever reason leave the previous one in there, behind it?).\n\nAnyways, one day, on my way home from work, I got a call from my Mom. She was really quiet, and distressed, and asked me, \"Hey, did you do that to my picture?\" I had absolutely no idea what the fuck she was talking about, so I said so, we moved on, hung up, and I drove home. When I got there, I asked her what she'd been referring to, and she showed me the picture. Holy shit. \n\nSomeone had cut out her dad, and his mom, and placed them side by side together in the frame. It was done very sloppily, and the rest of the picture was gone. The picture of my brother was nowhere to be found. We looked through the trash for the pictures (my brother, and the rest of the pic of her dad) and they weren't there. It was really bizarre. And, they weren't like, lovingly cut out. When I say sloppy, just imagine when you were a little kid, and had to cut something small out pretty fast, so you basically just got the general shape, and that was enough. I mean, a section of the man's head was lopped off.\n\nAfter investigating, and asking questions, this is the information we have:\n\nIt wasn't me, unless I just randomly got completely black out one night, retained the motor skills to do something like that, and for some reason covered my tracks.\n\nAccording to my mom, it wasn't her.\n\nAccording to him, it wasn't my Brother.\n\nIt wasn't my Mom's fianc\u00e9e. \n\nAdditional info: The four of us are the only ones with unrestricted access to the house, i.e. have keys. \n\nOnly my brother and I ever drink- my mom occassionally has a glass of wine or something, but shes really tiny and medicated, so she gets trashed if she drinks any more than that. \n\nMy Mom and Dad both think it was one of my friends from when we pregamed at the house one night, but: \n\nA) I asked everyone it could have been, in a completely neutral way, and they were all baffled. \n\nB) None of them were ever alone long enough to do that, let alone find scissors, pick out a picture,\u00a0 sdssdzcm one that is so clearly important (nice frame, black and white, not immediately recognizable people to nonfamily), and do the deed, without being noticed. \n\nC) The sloppy cutting, and the way all the evidence was disposed assa makes it seem malicious, but they were slid closer together, so someone (presumably) knew they were related. None of my friends would have. \n\nD) None of my friends would have fucking done that because it's rude, presumptuous, and weird as fuck, and we're all in our mid twenties. \n\nE) We pregamed at the house once over break. One time. And, it was a pregame- there's no way anyone got drunk enough to accidentally fuck that up. Or, like I said, was alone long enough to do that. ",

Confused, I check every downstairs table and eventually the mail box. Nothing at all. Finally I go back into the kitchen and notice one of the kitchen chairs is slightly pulled out from under the table.

To the right of me was a sidewalk where people were standing gawking, and to my left was oncoming traffic in the other two lanes, so I couldn\u2019t go around it, and I was going too fast to be able to stop in time. I knew if I relaxed I was less likely to be as severely injured, so I quickly shut my eyes and relaxed as much as I could.\n\n*And absolutely nothing happened.*\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, *I could see the crash behind me in my rear view mirror* and I was continuing along an empty (on my side) road. \n\nThis happened about 35 years ago, and to this day I have no idea how that happened.",

So I went back downstairs and they weren\u2019t in the freezer anymore.  Searched literally every square inch/nook and cranny between the chest freezer and the kitchen and they were not anywhere.\n\nThey never ever turned up.  To this day my mom thinks I was playing a dumb prank on her.  My most plausible explanation is that we live in a computer simulation and they got accidentally glitched out of it"

Like what the hell?! I came up with the story, I drew the comic panels, all of that was me. I felt so betrayed.

Out of nowhere, I saw a massive, almost solid cloud of what looked to be dirt coming at me. I'd say it was at least 20 feet wide and 10 feet tall. I scanned ahead of me but couldn't see any vehicle it could have came from. With nowhere to go I slowed down and took the hit, hoping there wasn't anything big enough in there to come through the windshield or jack up my truck(owner/operator). It was pretty loud as I smashed through it, the instant it hit I knew it wasn't dirt though. I immediately hit the washers because I couldn't see a damn thing through all of the carnage, my windshield was painted with guts. Turns out it was bees, freaking huge bees that sounded like rocks when they hit. I can't even imagine seeing that swarm if I was walking, they would kill the crap out of anything in their path.",

Which from this guy is about the equivalent of a trembling lip and shit stained pants.\n\nI'll tell this story in the first person as he told it to me.\n\nYears ago in the late 90's I was on my way from the house (central Texas) heading to Loredo to pick up a load. It was early morning, around 4 or 5. I had just come off a string of days at home, so I know I wasn't tired.\n\nI am on one of those two lane winding roads in the absolute middle of bum fuck nowhere, when i see something on the side of the road at the edge of my high beams. At first i just thought it was roadkill, as is usually the case. As I get closer, I see that it is roadkill AND there's someone crouching over the deer carcass. I remember thinking either this guys taking the antlers as a trophy, or he's fucking sick. As I got closer still I can now see that's this guys eating the fucking deer. He's pulling chunks of meat from the stomach and bringing them up to his face. At this point he stops mid motion and looks up at me. Not at my truck, but at me. He/it stands up and that's when I see that its fucking huge, brown, and covered in hair. I remember thinking at this point, oh fuck. This thing is standing on the tiny shoulder looking at me. By this point, maybe 3 seconds have passed and I'm about to the point in the road he's standing at. I didn't even think of stopping, in fact I'm starting to lay on it and get the hell out of there. As I'm passing it, its looking at me, again not at the truck, its looking through the driver's side windshield at me. He obviously has the intelligence to know that there's a driver in here and knows where I'm sitting. As I start to pass him I can still see its head above the hood of an old needle nose Pete. (Old truck design where the hood goes straight out from the windshield,  known for being tall and difficult to see around.) This thing is fucking giant. I remember seeing what looked like human intelligence in its eyes. It scares the shit out of me.\n\nSorry for the wall of text. It's a story worth sharing though.\n\nTLDR \u00bfBigfoot? eating a deer on the side of road.",

After a couple miles--after the load had settled a bit--he decided to pull over and throw his remaining wrappers around the load.

Spent the weekend with friends out in various parts of VA, got dragged off to other places even further out, the usual weekend fun times.\n\nIt's late Sunday night when I **have** to leave, Or I'm not going to be able to get home in time to start my (thankfully late afternoon) Monday. I'm fully rested, I didn't do any drinking, I'm not into drugs.\n \n\nOn the highway at about 3 AM, in the middle of bumfuck nowhere between Roanoke and DC, absolutely nobody around. I'm cruising along in the left lane simply because nobody else is around. No headlights for the past hour, no tail lights either. No road lamps either. It's dark, its mildly damp, its foggy. I have the music up, I'm feeling good, all is fine.\n \n\nAnd then I just happen to look to the left and there is a fucking dog barking at me. A German Shepard, in a car passenger seat, somewhat blue-glow from the instruments inside the car, and its got its face to its window and its barking its head off at me. I get a good hard look at it, too, because at first my brain is not registering 'cop car, dummy!'\n \n\nI'm doing 90+ in a 75, I promptly have the 'oh shit!' moment when the dog, the instruments, the white crown vic/light bar all click in my brain after a second hard look. I put my foot on the brakes and start slowing down hard but safe, to pull over. I even put my blinker on to start shifting lanes over to the right to pull over because- \n\n*WAIT.* **There is no shoulder on the left side of this road!**\n\nI look back to my left (where there is still no shoulder/room for another car!), and it's just gone. No trace. I slammed my brakes and stopped in the middle of the fucking highway,flipped on all my light bars and even looked around with my handheld spot.. there was NOTHING. No tail lights, no headlights, no engine sounds, nothing. There are no other tire marks in the damp but mine, and I can see for a nice long distance both ways, too. Nothing.\n\nMy vehicle had great visibility, and a lot of extra lighting (offroad SUV with the trimmings.), there is no possible way somebody pulled a sneaky, let alone drove that fast on wet sloped grass and rocks on my left side.\n\nSo.. Yep, there you have it. Ghost cop and his dog didn't like me speeding, apparently. :P"

            "\"For generations, the indigenous peoples of South American used blow darts laced with paralytic plant extract to hunt their prey. In the 1800s, English physicians who interacted with these indigenous South Americans recognized the possible uses of this paralytic agent, now known as *tubocurarine*, as an anesthetic agent for surgeries. Physicians noticed that animals under the influence of *tubocurarine* would become temporarily immobilized but would recover after a period of paralysis. According to these physicians, this discovery would revolutionize surgery as an anesthetic agent. So confident were they in their discovery that one of the physicians volunteered to undergo surgery under the influence of *tubocurarine* to demonstrate its effectiveness. Unfortunately, he failed to realize that, although the drug was an effective paralyzing agent, it did not have any effect on the sensory receptors of the body, so he felt every cut of the surgery without being able to move or do anything about it. \"\n\n\\-MCAT Biology\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the likes and the added knowledge regarding the subject that I had no idea about...horrifying but very interesting",

            "My GF had a girl tell her that Americans carry stress in their tailbone and it affects their spine and the way they walk, something about causing it to point downwards - the specifics of this aren't really that important. The amazing part is that this girl's boyfriend is a 'healer', and he is the one who has her convinced that she is suffering from this spinal issue in her tailbone, and the best, I mean absolute cherry on top best part of it, is that part of the treatment for this malady, which is of course incurable and will require treatment indefinitely, is anal sex. This guy wins the butt f*cking  bullshit award right here, because he has convinced his girlfriend that he is helping heal her of a made up condition by going in the back door. \n\n\nEdit- To everyone blowing their rape whistles, I agree that it's rapey, but this specific situation is not rape, at least from what information I have. She is clearly ok with this, and honestly I'd expect if she found out this is all bullshit that she'd be more upset that she wasn't being healed and that the sex was just sex, not that her healing regimen tricked her into sex. Furthermore, in what fantasy world are you living where law enforcement would do anything about such a situation? In the USA women can't even get law enforcement to take action against their partners when they are being violently abused and physically forced into unwanted sexual activity, even if they're not members of a marginalized community. Then, when legal action is taken, the victims are still subject to all manner of humiliation and trauma by placing the burden of proof on them. So unfortunately even if this is more sinister than silly, there is no reason to expect a resolution from our so called Justice system. \n\nI apologise if this story brought up any painful feelings for anyone. This was just meant to be a funny story, so please don't be so butt hurt about it, that kind of stress can affect your tailbone, requiring a potentially very uncomfortable treatment.\n\nEdit again: This was supposed to be a light hearted tale of bullshit that got a girl to think her boyfriend's dick had magic healing properties in addition to regular happy time orgasm properties when they had anal sex - something I thought most people would find as funny as I did. However, all the fun seems to be getting sucked out of this thread over questions of sexual assault and the American legal system, let me end my participation in any such discussions with the following: Yes, the lack of physical forensic evidence makes sexual assault cases very difficult for the prosecution to meet the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt, and in the eyes of the law everyone SHOULD be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Yes, male victims of sexual violence generally face a whole host of different and arguably worse issues seeking justice, and while the courts do not seem to be an ideal venue for alleged victims to seek justice, depending on your social circles, the court of public opinion is often too quick to condemn and convict based on mere accusations and hearsay, which can lead to incredibly destructive consequences for everyone involved. Put simply, sexual violence is fucked up and we don't seem to know how to handle it well as a society, and because of that the problem seems to keep evolving in ways that have repurcussions across the entire cultural landscape.\nThat being said, if you want to criticize anything I've said in this thread, can we please go back to how ridiculous it is that I think that the tightness of a girl's butthole is going to rip my dick off if I put it in there. I mean that seems like a way more fun conversation to have.",

            "Not married, but an ex-relationship. Let\u2019s call the twins Chad and Charles. I had maybe one class with Charles, and we never spoke. THEN, I started to have classes with Chad, and we were inseparable. He wasn\u2019t only my boyfriend, but also my best friend. Anyways, he broke up with me out of nowhere. Every time I saw him after that, he would act like a supreme asshole towards me. I never knew what I did to deserve\nthat, but it hurt a lot. When high school ended, Chad went to an out-of-state college, and Charles ended up going to the same college as me. \n\nFast forward to the first day of sophomore year of college. Charles and I had the same class together. It\u2019s a huge lecture hall. He could sit wherever he wants, but he CHOOSES to sit next to me. I didn\u2019t even notice until he said hi to me. I just responded hey back. Then, he proceeded to apologize for being mean to me in high school. I was super confused, but I figured he felt bad that he stopped talking to me after Chad & I broke up. \n\nI said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that. It was so long ago. If anything, it\u2019s your brother who should apologize.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy brother?\u201d he asked. \n\n\u201cYeah. Chad was such a dick after we broke up. Seriously, fuck that guy.\u201d\n\nNow, I knew that I was saying this to his brother, but the two of them weren\u2019t that close. I doubted that he would ever tell Chad that I said that. Even if he did, I wouldn\u2019t have cared. Charles just responded with, \u201cOh right, Chad.\u201d\n\nThen, class began. We started taking notes. Charles was writing with his left hand. I thought it was odd and told him, \u201cWait, I never knew you were left-handed too! I thought it was just Chad.\u201d He just gave me a little nod, and we went back to taking notes.\n\nBecause I can be kind of slow sometimes, things didn\u2019t click in my brain until after class. I rushed to Facebook and looked at Chad\u2019s profile. He had just transferred to the same college as me. I was talking to him the entire time.\n\nEdit: I'm making this edit after almost two weeks. I was going to do it before, but I didn't think anyone else would read it. Anyways, there were a few comments telling me to reach out to him and ask him what went wrong, so I went to Facebook and looked him up. Turns out I'm blocked. Then, I remembered that he blocked me right after he broke up with me. Not only on Facebook, but on all social media. On our college's student portal, there's a tab where you can look at the list of all the students in your class. That's how I ended up finding out that it was Chad I was talking to the entire time. So yeah, I basically have no way to communicate with him unless I see him in person. If I do see him and start talking, hopefully it won't be Charles and I end up making a fool out of myself again haha.",

            "posted this before, but here you go. My time at church camp\n\n\nWhen I was in 6th grade my parents talked me in to going to a week long church camp. I knew of, but didn't know personally any of the kids going, but they sold me that everyone would praise Jesus, ride horses, and have a good time. I decided to go. It was like a 6 hour drive in one of those big white vans. Quickly everyone started whipping out their CD cases and exchanging music and I instantly was like FUCK. I only had 2 CD's: Britney Spears \"Baby One More Time\" and Everclear. I was a really weird kid. Everyone was trying to talk to me about music and I had honestly never heard of any of the bands they were talking about. I just wanted to jam some Britney to myself. So naturally, I went the elitist route, said I had all of that music and I was listening to some new underground private shit they hadn't heard of.\n\nOnce we get to camp all I'm thinking is let's find some friends quick because I can't talk to these kids anymore. I go to the pool and make some friends with a few older kids. There were 3 girls, 2 guys, and me. They were all in 8th grade so obviously they were really cool. Plus, I thought the girls were really hot. I figured this would be the best time, if any, to get my first kiss. We decide to leave the pool and walk around the camp till we all had to have a group meet up. The \"cabins\" were separated by grades so they said they would walk by the 6th grade cabin and pick me up.\n\nFirst thing I do is put on my freshest outfit. Great time to break out my fresh white T-shirt. Can't forget my jean shorts. This was pre faded denim, so this was the industrial bright blue jean shorts. It's summer in Texas so I might was well top the outfit off with knee high white socks. And, of course, for the bitches... Doc Martens. I looked like a weird redneck lumberjack. So I walk out and they're kind of like wtf, but whatever. It's kiss time. We start walking and one of the older guys farts and all the girls laugh. Boom. Found my in. My friend Travis and I have been making fart jokes for quite some time so i'm up to speed on this area of humor. Bam, the other guy farts and all the girls laugh even harder. Got em. Now I'm thinking all I have to do is drop the biggest fart and literally the girls are going to laugh so hard they're going to each kiss me one by one. I start clinching and squeezing my stomach as hard as I can. I'm walking like a newborn deer. Then I feel it. Got a big one ready. So, instead of just dropping it out and laughing I wanted to make a big show about it. I run in front of the small group, squat down, turn just my head around, and forcefully shit myself. This was all out diarrhea. If you didn't know this before, early 90's denim was the least forgiving fabric in the world. EVERYONE knew I shit. It's running down my leg, being soaked up by my knee high socks. Instantly, I just react and start running. Kicking up shit like mud off a truck. I've never been to this camp before so I'm just running for anything. I find a bathroom toss the socks, boxers, shirt, but I couldn't drop the jorts. I can't just walk across the CHURCH camp naked. Plus at this point i'm thinking maybe they didn't really see it. I was really confident in my speed at the time so I was thinking I could say that's my thing. I drop giant farts and run before the smell catches me. Come to find out, not only were the 5 people I shit in front of outside the bathroom waiting for me, but there were like 25 kids. Instantly, I just ran in my doc's and jorts combo back to the cabin I was staying in with the other kids chasing me and yelling \"shit pants\"\n\nI run to my bed to find all the music nerds I drove up with going through my cd case. It only has the 2 cds. They are like wtf? Thought you had TONS OF SECRET MUSIC BRO. Wait, did you shit your pants? So yeah that was about 4 hours in to a week long trip. I really thought farting would impress these girls. I lost my favorite pair of Jorts and a bit of my pride that day.",

They gave us generic black cases and these little red buttons from radio shack.\n\nAnyhow, day before Columbine my friends and I decided to make them look like bomb switches.   So instead of drilling holes for the speaker to this contraption, we drilled \"push for explosion\" or whatever.\n\nOur teacher was fun, knew we were harmless and laughed\n\nSo Columbine happens, and me and my nerd friends are sitting at the lunch table putting these things together before class (because assignment was due) and this is shit we did all year.\n\nAnd cops, administration.   We were told to put the devices down and back away from the table.   People came and inspected everything, lunchroom cleared... Our parents were contacted...\n\nAnd nobody listed to anything we said.   We were assigned this shit, given this shit by the school.\n\nAll confiscated.\n\nThings got wierd after that, and my mother actually got me a pack of white shirts.   I switched my black ones out for them and didn't bring my electronics out of the classroom.\n\nDidn't have any more problems.",

But Dad hadn't gotten home yet so I was locked out of the apartment. For the record, as a kid I didn't shit at school. Couldn't. So now I didn't know what to do, but I knew the shit was coming. I tried holding it in I promise. I moved around, tried occupying my mind with other things, tried running.\n\nNext thing I know I'm in the corner of the laundromat shitting on the floor. God I'm so ashamed to admit this even 15 years later. I have nightmares about the cleaning staff or the unlucky tenant just trying to get their clothes out of the dryer and coming upon a steaming hot shit right the fuck there.

I'm pretty sure this is somebody with some mental health issues - if the activities just stopped without a satisfying resolution I'd assume they either started to get their head straight, or they quit/got fired for something else and this would just be a side bonus for that.\n\nIf anything further does come of this I'll make a point of making a post somewhere to update everyone.",

This directly puts money into the streamers pockets, but the community also directly benefits on a personal level.

It was certainly a lucky break but I also gathered enough knowledge to have the ability to own a part of an organization and not put money in.

            "My girlfriend of 6 years and sort of fiance was in a severe car crash when she was 16. Both of her best friends died instantly. She was the only survivor but they didn't think she would make it. She was in a coma for 9 months. She was in what is called a waking coma. She retained normal periods of sleep and open eyed wakefulness, but no higher brain functions. \n\nHere are some things about her experience. \n\nShe doesn't have any memories of the year prior or the year and a halfish after her coma and obviously no memories of the car crash.\n\nShe suffered a TBI and when she first got out of the coma she would get naked and sexual with people and anger very easily. These are common problems of people who suffer a TBI.\n\nShe went back to school after the coma, but her brain was still healing a lot. She was held back another year because her brain was still not retaining anything.\n\nToday she is a wonderful, bright 30 year old with a college degree. She has a slight speech impediment, gets frustrated easier than most, and it took her a while to get driving down. Honestly, she still scares the hell out of me when she drives, but there are worse drivers out there.\n\n",
            "After being in a really bad accident that left one of my good friends (the driver) brain dead, they put me into a chemically induced coma for under a week to prevent brain damage due to swelling. \n\nWhen I first woke up, my memory was much better than it was as it gradually faded in the days to come. I have a journal my mother recorded things in, and I recalled many things I shouldn\u2019t have been able to immediately after waking up. Today, I have very little memory of it all, but I can definitely say that having positive people around you definitely helps when you\u2019re in a situation like that. \n\nIf you have a friend in this situation, don\u2019t disregard them. Even though your life has moved on, they may wake up one day, and in their mind, not a day has passed since the last conversation they had with you.",
            "I'm not sure where I read it, but a girl talked about her experience and she mentioned that it was like going in and out of sleeping/dreaming. Just when she would feel like she was waking up, she could hear parts of conversations or the TV, but she would slip right back to 'sleeping'. She also said when people would clean her she could feel them touch sensitive parts of her like her armpit and butthole area. \n\nI'm an inpatient phlebotomist and even though some of my patients are sedated I still always introduce myself and say I'm here to draw some blood, just incase they could hear me."

            "22 years old, I had just moved to North Carolina from NY for a few months to help my mom get settled there.  My Dad worked in a building that was RIGHT next to the WTC.  I had just arrived for my opening shift at Applebees where i was waiting tables to save up enough money for my planned move to California.  When I got there, everyone was huddled around the TV - lots of people crying.\n\nTo put things into perspective this was very close to Camp Lejune so at least 50% of the other waitstaff were all military wives; so they \"knew\" their husbands were likely to be deployed.  Once i saw what was going on, I literally ran home (was walking distance from my apartment) and talked to my Mom.  She was on the phone with my Dad (divorced since 1986, they rarely spoke) pleading for him to leave (Dad kept saying no everything was fine) when the second plane hit.  At this point she screamed at him and he said he was leaving.  I spent the next 6 or so hours trying to get through to him on the phone, trying to remain calm.  I finally got a call from him around 5 PM or so - he was able to get home safe.  Since he worked for the NY State and carried a badge, he was able to put sirens on his company van and able to get through the bridges that were \"closed\" to get home on Long Island.  He picked a few people up on the way as well to get them out of ground zero area.  He was always a lover of horror movies, and described the scene as \"a godzilla movie - everyone was just running and terrified.  He still has a large mayonnaise jar full of ashes that he scraped from his van once he got home.  I call him every year on 9/11 to remind him how grateful I am I didn't lose him that day... probably the scariest day of my life.  ",

Told us all this was a huge deal and we would probably go to war over it. They sent us all home and me and my younger sister just watched the news all day with my mom. \n\nA second scary moment happened because we lived near a large Air Force base and heard two very loud booms. Turns out it was fighter jets hitting supersonic speeds, but we thought we were under attack again for some time. ",
            "I was a flight attendant for united airlines based out of LAX.  On September 9th I was assigned a 27 hour Boston layover. Super excited, I invited my friend to use a Buddy Pass and had a pretty uneventful flight. The flight was maybe 70% occupied so the passengers were able to move about freely (very uncommon today). We stayed at the Parker House downtown and had an amazing dinner in their Little Italy district. September 10th, we left for our return trip back to LAX. Again, very uneventful. When we arrived at LAX, the BOS crew was standing at the end of the jet bridge because that plane was headed back to BOS on the Red Eye flight. No big deal as we see this all the time. \n\nSeptember 11th, my husband wakes me up and we\u2019re sitting in bed holding our 1 yr old, both in complete shock. \n\nFast forward two days and I get called into my supervisors office and there\u2019s a guy in a suit asking me a ton questions about the flight on September 9th. Prior to 9/11, it was completely common to see people walking up and down the aisles, especially on long flights (I flew for 15 years and couldn\u2019t sit that long). So here\u2019s where my hairs stand up.... we apparently flew one of the suicide bombers to Boston on the 9th and that same plane that flew us to LAX, that did the Red Eye back, turned around to flight 175 heading back to LAX at 814a. This plane hit the south tower. \n",
            "I was one of those kids that loved watching the morning news. Specifically ABC. \n\nI woke my mom and dad up and told them what was happening. I asked not to go to school so I could watch was was happening. My mom said no. \n\nThe commute to school was about 30 mins. \n\nAbout 10 mins into that commute my mom turned around and I asked why. \n\nShe said \u201cyou might be too young to understand but there are events that happen and everyone will remember where they were when it happened. This might be the first of those days for you\u201d\n\nI remember getting back and watching Peter Jennings describe what was happening.

            "I was stationed in Pearl Harbor on a fast attack submarine. We had just recently returned from a 6 month deployment. Lots of folks on vacation, our boat was on a month long rest period where all you had to do was come in every 3 days for 24 hour duty if you weren\u2019t on leave.\n\nMy friend Bill had flown home to Jersey to see his family. He called me in a dead panic around 0400  Hawaii time to tell me that a plane had flown into the first tower. Being woken from a sound sleep, I pretty much told him that it wasn\u2019t funny and that I was going back to sleep. I was still junior enlisted at the time and was living in the barracks. About 10 minutes after Bill called me, I was fully awakened by heavy banging on all of the barracks doors by the duty guy.\n\nTold me to pack my sh*t up and get to the boat ASAP. We wound up going back out to punch some holes in the ocean, among other things.\n\nWhat I remember most is the unreality of the attack notification, and the stubborn unwillingness of my brain to accept that our sovereignty had been violated. \n\nI don\u2019t think I ever apologized to Bill for essentially hanging up on him either. I should probably do that at some point.\n\nEDIT: He forgave me. ",
            "In 3rd grade. I had slept on the couch and the first thing I wake up to is seeing smoke around the towers on my tv. I remember that image perfectly. Like the tv quality wasn\u2019t that great and there was an orangey tint to it. I can\u2019t remember if i saw the towers fall live but I remember my mom was terrified and calling my aunt and uncle all morning bc my aunt(her cousin) works in the building next door to the towers. \n\nMy uncle(my moms brother) was a NY Firefighter who saved trapped people from Tower Two. He said the smoke was so bad in the rooms he had to use an empty water bottle to breathe. He took several pictures that day n following weeks during the cleanup that has been in books and he has one photo that is up at the memorial/museum site.  I just remember sitting on the stairs all morning in my school uniform waiting until we heard from them and once we did my mom took me to school. Even after all these years I still have to fight tears back when I\u2019m thinking about it. \n\n\n\nEdit: here are some of his pictures if your interested I have more. He is in the last photo.  I hope this link works.  NSFW trigger warning, \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/JlXKs2I\n\nEdit 2: \n\n NSFW trigger warning\nmore pictures. https://imgur.com/gallery/LisBhMc\n\nBuilding 7 came down later on in the day. Right before it had my uncle and his partner went on to check on it bc it had been on fire all day long and as the building started to come down they ran out to get out of the way but Bc of the debris it was a total black out n had to use a fight fighter technique where u have to use your hands to feel along the building to get to a doorway. He said had it been 20 seconds more he would\u2019ve died bc he couldn\u2019t breathe. He didn\u2019t have his typical firefighter gear with him\n\nEDIT 3: Another thing I thought to add which was told to me by my uncle. He worked every single day, 15 hours, for 6 months. he had to cover for the firefighters who died that day, cover for firefighters who needed to attend funerals, work his own shift, as well a cleanup the city. \nHe said one thing that impressed him was that this one funeral he was at for a fellow firefighter he knew. He said he was pretty upset b/c the number of attendants that are normally there for the support were not b/c so many had passed away but before the funeral started two buses showed up and from one bus came out a large group of Canadian firefighters and out of the second came out a large group of firefighters all the way from Japan. It really touched him that they both came over all the way to show up to support n pay their respects\n\n EDIT: something small I felt like sharing. I just finished watching the movie \"The World Trade Center\" the final scenes of them rescueing the fire fighters out on the gurney from the WTC rubble reminded me of his photos\n\nEDIT EDIT New updated link since I deleted original. https://imgur.com/gallery/IUYpp5m\n",

We did film one wedding that seemed fine right up until the aisle walk.\n\nWe video the bride and groom prep. They have two suites\u2014one for the ladies and one for the gentlemen. My partner and I were having an easy time running back and forth. Everyone is drinking. Not light beer either. I mean knocking back shots. Empty bottles everywhere. Offering us rounds too as they go by. Everyone is pretty carefree, upbeat, and ready to party, the bride and groom most of all. This is going to be the easiest wedding we film. Or so we thought.\n\nNow everyone is seated in the ceremony hall. Groom and all his men are up front with the officiant. Bride\u2019s Maids start walking down the aisle. All beautiful. The bride walks in with her father. At this point I\u2019m filming the groom and his reaction. We get a wide shot because we can always zoom in during post. My partner is recording the groom and her father. I see the best man in my viewfinder pull out a flask from his jacket pocket\u2014the rest of the men do the same except Groom. So this is clearly planned. The best man speaks loud enough over the music so people turn to him away from the Bride. He raises his glass high and shouts \u201cHere\u2019s to Bride Name, here\u2019s to Groom Name; may you never disagree. But if you do\u2026\u201d He points at the bride with his flask hand and finishes \u201cFUCK YOU, here\u2019s to Groom Name.\u201d\n\nThey all drink to their frat boy toast. The best man hands the Groom his flask and he drinks it laughing!!\n\nI have never watched a video more than I have the reaction of the Bride and her father. Jaw dropped speechless. The ceremony went on. And it\u2019s not done. The officiant asks the Bride \u201cdo you take Groom yadda yadda\u2026\u201d and she surprisingly, yet weakly, says yes. The officiant asks the same of the Groom and instead of just saying yes, he screams \u201cFuck da fuck yeah I do!!\u201d Bride just face palms herself in embarrassment.\n\nThe look of disgust on her whole family\u2019s face the entire night after that was priceless and highly awkward to film. I could go on with more stories about this wedding, but this just about the bride and groom. Needless to say I think that\u2019s a big red flag.\n\nTL;DR Best man raises his flask as Bride is walking down the aisle and says \u201chere\u2019s to Bride, here\u2019s to Groom, may you never disagree, but if you do, fuck you \\*pointing at bride\\* heres to Groom.\u201d All groom\u2019s men drink from flasks including the Groom.",

Constantly texting while hanging out was annoying, but not a dealbreaker (especially if we were just chilling at one of our houses).

            "Alright so my older brother was like 10, I was like 5, and he loved Pokemon. I mean LOVED it, got the cards and games, plastic cases for the cards to protect them. Kid went to a convention in town, talking to some older kids and gents who loved the game, and on his way out he realized that his favorite, and consequently highest valued card, was stolen from him by one of those older kids/grown men. We found the guy but no one could prove it was ours in the first place. He was so heart broken. \n\nMy grandma, god bless her soul, went out of her way and bought this expensive ass charizard holographic thing, exactly what he had, for a crazy amount of money online. She then took about four ordinary ass booster decks, opened each one to check for the card, obviously it's rare so she finds none. She takes a useless potion card out and slid in the expensive ass card into one of the boosters, sealed it with a lighter, then taped all four together so that the last one was the altered booster. \n\nBirthday rolls around, brother is doing his thing, happy but every Pok\u00e9mon gift kinda brings him down, he misses that card and is sad about the lack of justice or reprimand for that asshole making him so sad. He gets to the final gift, Mimi's gift, we pull out the video recorder and watch. He goes through the first three boosters, gets some good cards and his friends are laughing and looking at them, he's a little happier. Final pack, gets through all the cards before the charizard, and bah god the look on his face at that last card, I swear he was crying and jumping around, ran straight to Mimi and hugged her so tight. He thought she had just gotten lucky, but after she passed away we told him that she had done that. I don't remember it well myself, just the way my parents told me and the video itself, which has been long lost after four movings :( but I'll never forget how incredible it was to see both the worst and best of humans in this story of some charizard card. \n\nEdit: it\u2019s nice to see people respond with love and kindness to this story so long after I\u2019ve posted it.

I tried to tell everyone that we had more, but they were shouting over me. One kid (maybe 9 or 10 years old) was standing next to his mom and crying because he hadn't managed to get a copy. His mom was trying to console him, while moving him away from the riotous mass in front of them.\n\nI went back to the crowd, finally it got quiet enough so I could explain that we had more in stock.

She hurried faster shushing me and I got a big talking to that afternoon.\nSnorting coke. I was in the 2nd grade when I got sent to the principals office for teaching my friends how to make 'lines' with salt and use part of a milk straw to snort it. My mom was REALLY pissed.\nDon't talk to cops or any 'straight' people. I didn't know why at first, but I lived in terror of 'straight' people. I got congratulations for making it through FBI questioning when I was probably 6 years old when they raided our land.\nSWAT teams are scary.\nBoobs are good for smuggling.\nCleaning out stems and seeds is a fun summer job.\nDon't say anyone's name on the phone.\nThose are just a few things I immediately recall.\nOoh, I forgot to add how every now and then people in our circle of friends would move far away for a while and change names and we weren't EVER allowed to call them by their old names. My mom also made us believe that morphine was an excellent pain reliever for all ages.",

            "My dad was investigated by the FBI for racketeering  but they were unable to press charges on him (He was also sued by a major financial entity for racketeering as well).  Anyways, when I was a teenager, my dad had a lawsuit brought against him by multiple employees for unpaid overtime and he ordered me to go through the boxes upstairs in a warehouse that we had to find all of their time cards.  The storage area was a disaster.  Papers everywhere.  No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find them so I told my dad that it was no use, the time cards weren't there.  My dad then yelled at me, telling me that he needed those time cards and said that all of these people were trying to rip him off so, if I had to, just make up time cards for them so that they were working 40 hours a week with no overtime but don't bother telling him about what I did to get the time cards when I had them.  I just had to have them for him one way or the other. I didn't think much about the last bit until much later but, long story short, I ended up making time cards that he used for the case.  He won.  Realized several years later that my dad had used me for forgery and when I confronted him about it, he just laughed and said that I was a minor at the time and nobody puts  a minor in jail for a white collar crime. \n\nI've run into some of those employees since then and, when they accosted me for being his daughter and how they would want to punch my dad (or worse) if it was him they ran into, I've always confessed this to them.  Ironically enough, they have all said that they would punch him on my behalf, too, because the fact that he used his own daughter pissed them off even more.   And about the racketeering thing? He loved laughing about that and calling himself a \"don\".    \n\n\nWhen I was going to take over the business several years later after the forgery bit, his oldest employees gave me loyalty oaths.  I ran like hell.  My dad absolutely was a racketeer."

            "Being hungry all the time. TL;DR at the end.\n\nI have PKU which is basically a genetic condition that is treated with an incredibly restrictive diet. I knew a list of things I absolutely could not have, and I had printed books that told me how much I could have of certain foods and I mostly had to take a packed lunch everywhere with me, even when just going round to friends' houses.\n\nThe problems came when my parents divorced, my mum basically kicking my dad out and taking custody of me and my siblings....and she immediately stopped caring. She made sure I stuck to my diet but made no actual effort to make sure I was eating enough to function.\n\nAt it's worst point, I was eating a small bowl of cereal in the morning (25g), a few slices of cucumber (tomatoes made me sick, and seeped into the lettuce of my school 'salad') an apple (I'd be given an orange as well but the stringiness of it made me sick), a carton of apple juice, then in the evening - a small plate of whatever was left over from what my family had eaten the day before but in small amounts as I could only have tiny quantities of most of it, with the parts I couldn't have removed. And that was it. That was what I ate everyday most days for over a year. During the holidays it was worse because my mum had to make me my lunch herself and she just wouldn't bother.\n\nI couldn't make it myself as I was 9, I couldn't eat most conveniently available snacky foods, I couldn't eat bread, I couldn't have crisps, we rarely had fresh, readily available food. So a lot of the time I'd reach into the rubbish bin and eat whatever my brother had thrown away. And my mom smoked so a lot of times it tasted of ash but I was so hungry I didn't care.\n\nI always assumed this level of hunger and desperation was just how everyone with the condition lived because my diet was so restrictive, and my mum was pretty manipulative and had me convinced that a lot of things were my fault including her failing relationships, her inability to hold a job, her failed marriage, my dad's sickness. Like I thought, this has to be because of my diet, this has to be how everyone with this condition lives, in a constant state of hunger.\n\nCut to a year or so later, I was living with my dad's parents. Typical grandparents they would go out of their way to make sure I was fed. They cooked larger portions of unrestricted food and allow me to serve myself at the dinner table, search for receipes made for people with my condition, or altered recipes they already used, they made sure I knew where the food I could eat was, and what it was, so that I could get my own snacks without having to wait on someone else to sort me out. I zipped from badly underweight, to borderline overweight.\n\nEven so, the light bulb didn't go off until I was 16 and my specialist pediatrician arranged for me to meet some other adults (20+) with the condition to give me hope for the future. It was a great experience but I still remember the look everyone gave me when I asked how they dealt with the crippling hunger when they were a little kid. It was like I'd sprouted a second head. They all explained, including my pediatrician, that none of them had gone hungry as children, they'd always had food, and that's when it hit me how willfully negligent my mum was.\n\nAll those times I thought she'd been trying her hardest to be a mum, was really just her being lazy and refusing to try. Even to this day, I have an unhealthy willingness to go hungry for longer than I should (I'm talking days), often having to be reminded by people to eat because I'm just so used to going without for extended periods of time.\n\nTL;DR - mum convinced me it was my fault I was hungry as a kid, until I met other people with the same condition and I realised she was just a lazy bitch",

            "Okay, so legit answer.\n\nOne night I'm out working, and as I go down the street (fairly nice middle class area surrounded by some high crime neighborhoods) around midnight I see a dude on a bike, no lights on, pulling a lawnmower behind him on a rope.\n\nI immediately flip a 180 and light him up. Recognize the guy as a local homeless dude with some prior burglary/theft arrests. I walk up and just open with \"Dude, come on...\"\n\nGuy holds his hands out and swears he didn't steal the lawnmower. Claims someone just gave it to him. I ask who, and he doesn't know a name. So I demand he tell me where to find said lawnmower owner. The directions he gave were literally \"go that way a bit, then right at a stop sign, and take one of those side streets that way. It's about halfway down a street, at a house that has a pickup and a car in the driveway.\"\n\nBy this point backup had arrived, so I leave him in the presence of backup, and drive off in search of his mythical donor of lawn equipment. I made a decent guess as to the first turn, then flipped a mental coin as to which of the next three side streets he would have gone down. I pick the second of the three streets, and start down it. Every other fucking house has a truck and car combo...there must have been a dozen houses that matched the description.\n\nHalfway down, I see an average looking house and go \"ehh, I'll try this one\". After all, it's midnight and this is a wild goose chase. Go up, ring the doorbell...middle aged dude comes to the door. \"Hello sir, have you been giving away lawnmowers to random sketchy homeless guys at midnight today?\"\n\nYes. As a matter of fact, he had. Homeowner goes on to complain to me that his wife was upset as his continual inability to get the mower running, and had ordered him with some severity to remove the mower from the house or face the consequences. He pushed it to the curb right as homeless guy rode by, and the latter had asked and received his permission to take it.\n\nI drove back in shock and amazement. Apologized to homeless guy, and sent him on his way. A few months later we ran into each other at a nearby gas station, and he told me it turned out just to need a new spark plug, and that he had gotten it running again, before going on to sell it for $150 to someone.\n\nFor years after, whenever I would run into him, he would always make sure to remind me of the money he made from selling that \"stolen\" lawnmower...LOL",

The whole house was in disarray, and the call had come because of yelling heard by the neighbors.  She was crying and talking in an Asian language that none of us understood, and kept gesturing toward her huge husband.  He wasn't talking.  We wrap him up, take him to the station, and are trying to interview him, but he's not saying much. We intend to charge him with domestic assault.  We notice somewhere along the way that he has horrible welts all along the backs of his hands and along his forearms.  It took a lot of prying, but we finally got out of him that his wife would beat him with wire coat hangers when she was mad, and apparently that was pretty often.  He was too embarrassed to admit to anybody that he was being abused by his wife who was less than a third of his size.

They create adds in such a way that when people google the hotel's phone number, a number to Expedia comes up, and if the customer asks if the are speaking directly with the hotel front desk they will say yes.\n\nThere have been countless times where guests have called to cancel their reservation that was booked through Expedia. I inform them that they will have to contact Expedia directly, since they pre-paid through them, but that it will be no issue because the hotel does not charge a penalty fee for cancellation. An expedia representative will call the hotel with the guest on hold and ask about getting it cancelled. I tell them it's no problem. They ask if we will be charging a penalty fee, and I tell them no. All is right and good, right? NOPE.\n\nI then get a call back from the guest who is upset, saying that the Expedia representative told them they could not be refunded because of the fee charged by the hotels cancellation policy. Taking the guests money and blaming it on the hotel, and keeping all of the profit. This has happened countless times.\n\nI once had a guest while at the front desk call about cancelling 3 days out of a multiple day reservation, as she had to leave earlier than expected.

In my time at the health department I never saw them worse than in that kitchen. We got calls about the roaches at least twice a month, and every time we went they were back with a vengeance. They were closed for them multiple times, but just never kept up with the pest control and cleaning necessary to get rid of them. \n\nThey were also dying tilapia red and selling it as red snapper on their menu. This is pretty common around here, but it's super illegal because it's literal false advertising. Fun fact: some people are allergic to tilapia. Not sure I want to be around when that restaurant owner finds that out. \n\nThey had hundreds of cardboard boxes stacked outside their back door, plus a bunch of old equipment they weren't using. This added to the roach problem and any day it could turn into a rodent problem. One time I drive by and they had animal cages back there, too. I don't wanna know that story... \n\nAdd to that: I'm pretty sure the employees are all indentured servants or victims of human trafficking. They all show up in the same beat up white van every day and work a 12+ hour shift. The owner is unkind to them and they don't respect him. He says he can trust them to do their jobs, but was sketchy when we said to fire them and hire employees who will. We never had proof, but it was always upsetting and struck me as off.\n\nHe tried to bribe me and my coworkers multiple times, too. I'm not a health inspector anymore but he still tries to give me free food or money when he sees me.

I haven't had an ankle sprain since and it's been 10 years. \n\nEdit: here is the original article:\n\nhttps://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/how-to-fix-bad-ankles/"

            "The fact that life can just change. Not gradually, and not with someone like a parent helping you through it. Just come to an abrupt halt and shoot off in another direction.\n\nFor years I\u2019ve been freelancing as an artist; doing children\u2019s books,  animating for video games, all sorts of stuff. Then my partner and I have a kid, sure it shakes things up a bit but while he\u2019s in school I can still work on that stuff while my partner works. \n\nThen five months ago she has a stroke. And now she\u2019s blind. She can\u2019t work, and neither can I because I\u2019m at home full time either caring for her or our son or both. I don\u2019t have time to hang with friends anymore as I need to organise a carer to come over when I\u2019m out and after-hours on a weekend is prohibitively expensive ($100+ per hour). \n\nGovernment Medicare gives us almost enough money for rent, and the only reason we\u2019re still eating is through the generosity of friends and the fact that my partner had her bank account automatically shave some money off her pay to put into her savings. \n\nBut there\u2019s no going back. Her sight is gone. For good. And her mobility is shot as well. So we\u2019re looking at me being full time care for at least a few years. If not longer. \n\nThe worst part is I don\u2019t feel like I can complain. Because at least I can still see.\n\n[Edit: Thank you everyone for the kind words and suggestions. To answer a few things for anyone just finding this:\n\nI\u2019ll be talking to a psych or counsellor once I\u2019ve organised the same for my partner and our son. It\u2019s not the best thing in the world but right now they need it more than me.\n\nThere are various disability services I\u2019ve looked into and signed up for but either they can\u2019t cater to what\u2019s needed, or are unavailable until various government payments come into effect (ie: I can\u2019t afford them without being subsidised). Friends have been able to help occasionally but the best I\u2019ve been able to manage is having maybe two to three hours a week of free time, and even then not at a time when I need it. I used to be able to go for long walks if I got too stressed, and it\u2019s kinda hard to organise that in advance.\n\nRight now my focus is letting my partner unwind from hospital. Not easy to do when you have no AC and temperatures are record highs for weeks at a time. But after that I\u2019ll be pushing her to actually *DO* something. Learning Braille, dictating a novel, sculpting, anything but sitting in a chair listening to audiobooks.\n\nThe school have been fantastic with my son, and have been really supportive of him in class and out.\n\nThank you again folks. It\u2019s been a rough few months, and I didn\u2019t expect my comment on the OPs post to get this much attention. It\u2019s lifted my spirits after a long week of staring at doctors down the barrel of a lawsuit and being permanently on hold to various government departments and banking institutions.]",

            "Three years ago, a brand new redneck family moved into the house next to my Dad's. They decided to have a huge 4th of July party, and invited dozens of people. Apparently bought a ton of fireworks, and decided to do a mini show in their huge back yard. My Dad and I were watching from his back porch, where we had a good view but were still away from their party. They started the show, and a few nice explosions went off. I'm a photographer, so I decided to try to snap a few pics of the fireworks while we watched.\n\nAll of the sudden about 5 minutes into their show, there was a HUGE explosion, and then the entire sky lit up, bright as day! Dumbasses set off every single firework at once. It was like a war zone. As the explosions stopped and the smoke cleared, you could hear someone screaming a man's name, and they all tried to find the person. Eventually he was found safe.

I had to get doubled for an hour to where a chopper could pick me up and spent 5 days in hospital. The stick severed the jugular vein but thankfully just missed a major artery.

            "I caught rocky mountain spotted fever from a tic bite. Known to kill. I'll try to find more pics, because it got much worse after this. It spread everywhere except my face and junk, thankfully. Went to several doctors who were all like, \"Holy fuck you gon die son, no idea what's wrong\" \n\nI was put on numerous antibiotics and steroids. The picture is how I looked when I first went to the clinic. The doc was like, \"We're going to give you the biggest steroid shot we have on location\". She came back with a syringe that looked like a goddamn push pop. Shot it in my right side ass cheek. I'll tell you, that shot is definitely in the top five most painful things I've ever experienced. So much liquid, nowhere to go. I could feel the tissue under my skin tearing and ripping as she pumped me up. I couldn't sit back down, almost passed out, and puked in the sink at the clinic. \n\nMy condition worsened over the next several days. My fever was over 104 Fahrenheit several times. The rash enveloped my whole body. It changed from red and bumpy/raised to purple, then almost black. By the time my skin was turning black, the rash was loosing its texture. I think I was getting better at that point, but it looked like my skin was rotting off. \n\nI couldn't wear clothes for like a week. So itchy I couldn't sleep. \n\nI went to 3 different doctors and had all sorts of blood work and tests run. Nothing conclusive ever came back, but two of the doctors said that Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever fit my symptoms. Unusual for it to happen at all, let alone in Ohio. Tics were bad that year. Never found one on me or any sign of bite, though. However, several family members picked tics off themselves during the ordeal. \n\n\n\nHere it is-\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/smkLZXO\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit- adding a tidbit from my comment below to elaborate/shout out to my sister for potentially saving my life-\n\n\"It especially scares me because several doctors were just like, \"WTF mate, this is fucked\" and had no idea what it was. **My sister** was/is going through medical school, and she's the one who said \"rocky mountain spotted fever\" first. We mentioned to the doctor(s) about RMSF, and it wasn't until then that they decide to treat it as that, and got me on the correct antibiotics. I had been probably 4 or 5 days before this came up.\"\n\nEdit two- I live in Illinois now, but I'm currently visiting family in Ohio. I've checked both my phones, and I don't have any pictures after this. However, I think there are pictures on my computer back in Illinois where my condition was worse.

I showed the cops, \"Well heres this skid mark where I attempted to avoid them, and here's a skid mark where I over corrected, and here's this skid mark where I started flipping, and none of them are in his lane sooo.\" Insurance fought it out and couldn't find the person at fault during their \"investigation.\" They did end up paying me out for totalling it, more than I paid for it, so I was happy.

When I was finally moving out curiosity got the best of me and I pushed on the panel at the top of the stairs until it popped open and hoisted myself up there. \n\nIt was completely dark and the floor was covered in at least an inch of dust, and I found that it was an entire extra floor to my unit. There was some old rotting furniture and magazines littered throughout the rooms. I eventually found a small hole in one of the walls that went into the sealed off upstairs of the unit next to mine and decided to go through that one too. I found a smaller hole at the back end of that area that led to the next one. I eventually made my way through about 5 or 6 of these sealed off spaces that had no entrances save these small holes in drywall.

The place was falling apart, but it was huge and rent was dirt cheap. About two years into living there I went to the basement to do some laundry and momentarily lost my balance, reaching out to steady myself using one of the wall panels. It flexed more than I expected, and after some inspection I found that it was removable. Behind it was a small, mostly empty, very dirty concrete room about 100 square feet. I say mostly empty because right in the middle there was a hole the size of a well that had been previously bricked up.  It must have been old because the bricks had eroded at some point and exposed some of the hole, maybe a 2ft diameter circle out of the full 5 feet. After calling my friends down to look at it I got the courage to creep a little closer and peer down into it. There was another room roughly the same size but deep, maybe 15 feet down, and mostly dirt. We shined a flashlight down into it and I could swear there was a teddy bear at the bottom. Unfortunately despite plenty bargaining, none of us were ever able work up the courage (liquid or regular) to tie a rope and climb down for a closer look. Especially after we noticed that the bricks which I thought had fallen in were all accounted for, scattered around the hole as if something had broken out.\n\nAt the risk of my account being discovered by my redditor friends, this was in Pittsburgh. We did a little research and think the sub-basement may have been related to prohibition, but honestly I'm just willing to accept that explanation in order to avoid lifelong nightmares."

            "When I was a kid, having an older brother meant that I basically grew up watching 80s/90s horror.\n\nThere is a movie called The Gate...basically some kids end up playing a metal record backwards, and it results in a gate to hell opening up in their back yard.\n\nLots of spoilers below.\n\nHighlights of my traumas from this film include:\n\nKid dreaming that he is dancing with the ghost of his mother, only to wake up and realize he's holding his now dead dog's body.\n\nA demon creature being knocked down and shattering into a bunch of tiny versions of itself, that then basically kinda hang out being creepy shits.\n\nThe phone ringing, kid picking it up only to have a loud voice scream \"you've...been...baaaaadddd\" through it, causing the phone to burst into flames and melt.\n\nA re-animated corpse smashing through the wall of the kids bedroom and grabbing him. (My bed was up against the wall in my basement room. Nope.)\n\nPossibly the same demons from above grabbing one of the kids' ankle from under his bed.\n\nThat last one was the direct reason for me running and jumping onto my bed from a few feet away for the longest time.\n\nI also stopped sleeping on the wall side of my bed to avoid corpse grabbings, while at the same time being constantly vigilant to not venture too close to the room side, lest under-bed demons grab me.\n\nI was also convinced for the longest time that mini demons would get me in my back yard, as that scene took place in a  area that vaguely looked like our back patio/garage door.\n\nI haven't actually seen the movie in a good 30+ years, so it could very well actually have been terrible and not scary at all.\n\nGreat memories, that film...\n\nEdit: [Oh no](https://i0.wp.com/www.attackfromplanetb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/thegate0.gif)",

He told me to pretend I was his nephew and he kept introducing me to customers that way. Then when we were cleaning windows he kept telling me his fantasies of fucking the housewives. It was super weird. Plus, he chewed tobacco and while driving would spit the juice between his legs onto the floor of his ratty truck. Then at the end of the day he told me it was just an audition and tried not to pay me. One of the strangest days of my life. "

I hang back a little bit because the creepy old guy whome i didn't recall seeing in my whole life really freaked me out. Regaurdless of my anxiety my mom said i should approach grandpa and share some nice words with him. I understood by how sad my mother was that i shouldn't argue too much so i approached his hospital bed to speak to him. He didnt seem concious at all so i just did what my mother did, leaning forward and just whisper some nice things to him.\n\nThings took turn when mid sentence his eyes flair opon and he stares at me making me stop what im saying. My heart dropped into my ass when he looked at me because it was pure hatred in his eyes. As soon as we made eye contact he bolted upright from his bed and wrapped his hands around my neck and started throttling me as hard as he could. I barely even remember what happened but my mom was screaming for a nurse. And grandpa kept yelling at me while shaking my neck violently \"F*CKING BETRAYAL YOU BETRAY ME*\n\nAnd then he died. almost as fast as it began it was over. His grip loosened and he flat lined. My mother was inconsolable and i was extremely confused and crying out of sheer trauma at the situation. \n\nLater after we managed to calm down a nurse explained to my mother that his severe dementia had left him barely coherent and it was likely he had thought i was someone else.

            "Was a bouncer at a club in LA for a minute in the 90's. Stopped some dudes clearly affiliated (in a gang) at the door after they refused security checks. After a few minutes of their threats & Manson lamps they left spewing all sort of warnings.\n\nA little later it starts to wind down and because it's a little slow & we're overstaffed so I start to drink. I get a bit drunk (not wasted, but sleepy-buzzed) so I tell my buddy I'm going to go lay down in the back of his car for a while.\n\nA few minutes after lying down I realize I have to piss. I get out and stumble a few into a spot between a guard gate (for a parking lot) and a building for a little privacy (there's a few dozen people milling around in front of the club). I'm about 25 feet away from the club's entrance and just off an alleyway.\n\nWhile I'm relieving myself, a dude runs right past in front of me, around the guard booth to my rear, and unloads a 9mm (recovered rounds from back seat/trunk/roof/bumper) into the back seat of the car I'd just crawled out of.\n\n\"bam bam bam bam...\" Unloading into the car.\n\nHe then turns, runs right back past me, and down the alley into the night. Don't think he saw me at all.\n\nNothing really came of it. Except my partner was convinced I was a \"marked man\" and refused to be near me for a year or so.\n\nEdit: holy crap, I kind of expected this to get buried. This was Los Angeles. I was about 25 (almost 50 now) so some specifics are long gone - but I remember this: my buddy was genuinely terrified by this, I don't think he knew anything about it (in fact he seemed to interpret the event as a larger conspiracy to have me snuffed - not some random pissed off dude making a point/getting jumped in) and because he ditched the car/wouldn't take my calls it got left at that. For those concerned with the car - it was, like, a 1980's rusted out sedan...maybe a $500 car. Details about the slugs/number of rounds fired were relayed to me later by third parties (my friend and I were known in the neighborhood, people were talking about it). Thank you for the well wishes. Honestly though, this wasn't even the first time I was shot at (it's been a long strange trip).\n\nEdit 2: Also, I tried to argue later that it's just as likely the guy was shooting at someone else across the street and that the car just got in the way. But there were holes all through that thing. Back seat had 4/5, another 2/3 went into the back window and ended up in the backs of the front seats, another 2/3 rounds went right into the trunk.

            "Adding TLDR: gut instinct felt something was off when I saw two men 'helping' another man - turns out he was dead and they were just ditching his body.\n\nA few years ago, about 1am Sunday morning, I had to take my dog out before bed. I live in a rough neighbourhood and I am a female so I usually have my guard up regardless of the time.\nBefore I left the apt building my gut told me something was up. The street was completely void of traffic and people except for a van parked out to the side of the road. Outside of it were three people whom I quickly identified as male. Right away my reaction is to keep my head low, put my jacket hood up and not bring attention to myself. \nOut of the corner of my eye, I could see they were struggling; on closer inspection I see two of the men are holding up the other man between them. I make the assumption that they are headed home after a night of heavy partying and they are just helping their friend get sick or something. I am telling myself this to ease my fears. Then they notice me and they stop everything and freeze. I thought that was odd and no good so I drag my dog straight back to my building (I don't even know if he got the chance to pee that night!)\nI go to bed and thinking nothing more of it... until it's time to take the dog out again in the morning. There was a notice in the elevator asking for witnesses as to exactly what I saw that evening because a dead body had been found. \nSo... this wasn't a friend of theirs after all.... they were ditching a body. \nStill upsets me today and I will never ignore my intuition again. \n",

            "I grew up in a fairly quiet neighborhood, and when I was twelve, we got our first dog. It was my job to take him for a walk every evening after dinner. \n\nThis dog was the goofiest, sweetest golden retriever mix, not a mean bone in his body. He never met a stranger, and when he would occasionally escape, we usually found him in a neighbor\u2019s yard, playing with some kids. He was the farthest thing from a guard dog you can imagine.\n\nSo I\u2019m walking him one night after dinner, by myself, and he suddenly stops dead in his tracks in the very middle of the sidewalk.

I apologized, made some excuse I don\u2019t remember, and hurried away under the pretense of getting my vicious dog away from him.\n\nTurns out this dude was a rapist who assaulted three other neighborhood kids in those trees, and my dog was probably the only reason I wasn\u2019t the fourth.",

We're allowed to call a rapid response team (people who come when something very bad is happening to a patient) if the patient \"just doesn't look right\" to us. \n\nI got my job right out of nursing school in a department that deals with mothers and babies right after delivery. I was 22 years old, had no children of my own, and my only experience with newborns was my last six months on the job.\n\nI had this patient and her baby who both seemed to be doing well. The baby's weight, vital signs, and intake and output were all normal, but I felt like something wasn't right. For one thing, I had never heard this baby cry. Anyone who has ever been anywhere around newborns know that they can pretty much cry at the drop of a hat, for anything, at any time. This baby didn't cry when I put her on the scale to weigh her (They usually cry like you're actively trying to kill them), or when I pricked her heel for a blood sugar. I felt like a total idiot because I had almost no experience with newborns, but I decided to talk to someone anyway. \n\nI brought the baby to the nursery nurse, who has had over 20 years experience in the department, and told her that I thought something was up. The baby looked fine. Her vitals, including her blood sugar, were perfectly normal. However, the baby was floppy (not a technical term, but used to describe a baby when its arms and legs aren't curled up tightly next to the body like they're supposed to be. This baby's arms and legs were limp and stretched out). She had a poor grasp (she didn't tighten her fingers around our fingers like newborns are supposed to do) and when we could get her to cry (we barely could), her cry was weak. \n\nThe nursery nurse agreed that something was wrong and called the neonatologist (newborn baby doctor) who was on call that night. She spent about 20 minutes on the phone just trying to tell him that something wasn't right, even though everything was technically normal. Luckily, the neonatologist trusted her judgement and had us send the baby to the NICU. \n\nThat baby ended up staying in NICU for about a month, being tube fed because she stopped eating well. They did genetic testing on her and discovered that she had been born with a pretty rare (only 30,000 cases diagnosed annually in the US) genetic disorder that usually isn't diagnosed until the baby is unable to sit up on their own at about 6 months of age. The disorder has no cure, but doctors were able to start treatments on her in order to manage some of the symptoms almost immediately.",

It was about 230am and we were looking forward to getting home and ordering some pizza when we came across two guys and a very drunk girl. Initially we didn't think anything about it because it was a pretty common sight on a Friday, but as we walked behind them for a few minutes we noticed how out of it she was. One of the guys was essentially carrying her, and her clutch was loosely dangling from her limp wrist. Our street came up, but instead of turning down it we decided to see what was going on. The guys explained that she was one of their girlfriends and had too much to drink so they were taking her home. We asked them a few more questions: what bar they were at, where she lived, if she was an Ottawa U student etc... They gave pretty convincing answers but all the same seemed really uncomfortable and wanted us to go away. During the conversation the guy holding his \"girlfriend\" shifted her position to get a better grip, which caused her arm to dangle down and drop her clutch. Before they could move, my roommate grabbed the clutch and took out her ID. My roommate then asked if they knew her first and last name along with her birthday. This is where things changed. The other guy got really aggressive and confrontational while the other went silent. They didn't know her name OR birthday. I then pulled out my phone and called police. The guy dropped her and they took off running. We waited with her for about ten minutes until the police and EMS got there. We gave a statement but did not have much to go on other than their descriptions. Police told us they suspected she had been dosed, and that she was lucky we happened to be walking behind her. Pretty scary stuff.\n\n\nUpdate: Thanks for all the kind words and my first ever gold. It was a pretty surreal experience, but I would like to think that most people would have acted the same way.",

            "\\#1 mistake I made in high school was assuming that my teachers were always good at dispensing content in an understandable way. There's so much variance.\n\nDepending on your teacher:\n\n* Plague your teacher with questions before/after class. They're (hopefully) there to help you.\n* Take notes during class. Take a picture of the board if you need to. If your teacher goes off slideshows, get copies of each lecture.\n* Supplement your teacher's lectures with lectures from the internet. There's almost always someone online who's figured out a better way to divulge the info than your teacher.\n* If your teacher is confusing or going too fast, let them know, maybe multiple times. They might not realize.\n* Look into private tutoring. Maybe your school offers it, or your teacher would be willing to help, or something online. A good tutor analyzes what you know so they can teach at your level.\n* Get enough sleep and eat right. Keep your brain running at high efficiency for efficient studying.",
            "Study in short bursts. I remember a psych prof in college saying it\u2019s been proven that after 20-30 minutes of studying your brain starts to retain less and less information. So study for 20-30 minutes, take a quick 10 minute break, then go back to studying.",
            "Don't procrastinate or take a \"break\" before doing your work. The second you get assigned homework start it immediately after school. This one might be obvious but it's something that helps me out. This is not exactly a study tip, but if you don't understand ANYTHING no matter how stupid, never shy away from asking a teacher.",
            "If you use flash cards; start with two or three and slowly add in more to the deck once you\u2019ve mastered a few.\n\nI used to think flash cards didn\u2019t work because I\u2019d sit there with a deck of 50 wondering why I couldn\u2019t remember any when I got back to the beginning.

            "Reading tips:\n\n* Don't highlight for the sake of highlighting without giving a reason. At the end of every text you highlight, write a short sentence explaining why you're highlighting that part.  Two or three key words works also.\n\n* At the end of every chapter in the textbook, write summary of it that is at least a page long. If the chapter is broken into a lot of sections, write half a page for each section.  Reading the summaries will help when test time comes, and you can reuse the summaries in your essays if applicable.\n\nWriting tips:\n\n* Write your introduction last. It sounds crazy, but this allows you to restructure the essay if you see it's not flowing correctly.\n\n* Use an outline, or a brain storm map. Even if it's only a couple of words, seeing your paper \"in the flesh\" even in the embryonic stage helps.\n\n* Use the voice recorder app on your phone if you get an idea for your paper or project and can't write it down at that moment. You're gonna forget it if you leave it for later.\n\n* If you're not doing it already, write your papers in Google Docs. It saves per keystroke, so you don't have to worry about losing work if your computer crashes.\n\n* Proofread your work by READING it out loud if you can't have someone proofread it for you. You'll catch a lot of errors this way instead of just using your eyes. If you don't pay for printing, then print out a copy and go over it manually.\n\nTime management:\n\n* 45/15 - 45 mins of work for every 15 mins of rest. Start with this and reduce it the closer you get finishing your paper/task--30/30, 15/45 etc. I use 15min intervals, use whatever you want.\n\nHomework organization:\n\n* Start by doing your easier HWs first and scale upwards towards the hardest. The easier HWs will get you in the groove quicker than tackling the harder one(s) will. Going for the harder problems first already has you at a disadvantage and will discourage you from doing work.\n\nEdit\n\nThank you very much for the gold/silver. Please consider donating instead to [backpack programs](https://www.voa.org/operation-backpack) or help teachers get the [classroom supplies ](https://supplyaclassroom.org/home)they need.",
            "* When I'm trying to learn something, I pretend that I am teaching someone and for some reason this helps.\n* Write notes down, there's something about reading notes written down by yourself and it stays longer in your memory.\n* Treat it like a job. Hit the books Monday through Friday 9-5. Work in the library, not your room or apartment. Don't miss a class. Work ahead during that 40 hours.

Do you like to rephrase things to understand it, or draw it out or other visual aids, maybe saying what you think is important outloud is the way to go. Many options but sticking by one or a few that suits you best and gradually working out how to improve that process is probably a really efficient way to study than or reading everything and then trying to memorizing things over and over again for a long period of time."

Anyways on one of the connecting flights I sat next to an older women and she noticed a car magazine that I had. We started talking and I told her I liked Mustangs and turns out she had 2 82 GTs, had won awards with them etc. It was really cool to talk to her and when we landed we went our separate ways. Fast forward 2/3 years (can't remember exactly) and my dad and I drove to Arkansas to pickup a mint 82 GT. We get there and start talking to her and she starts saying the other cars she has and it finally clicked in my head, she was the lady on the plane!

The ship just left the city, and I was relieved of duty; as now it was vacation time for me after months at sea sailing from Perth, AU to Legazpi, PI via the treacherous Makassar Straits.  So Avengers it is? hahaha.\n\nAfter the movie, It got dark out, and I wandered around town and got lost.

If he didn't, well.. then I applaud him for being an amazing actor and he's in the wrong line of work.\n\nWe chilled at the festival and got to know each other over a couple of beers (on me).  Afterwards, he took me down this dark dark path, and I got a bit apprehensive.  He kept saying \"don't worry, I'm taking you to my house for dinner!\"  \n\nAnd yes, he took me to his tiny friggin shack of a house near the ocean for dinner.  His wife was cooking, and he had two tiny kids running around happy their daddy is back home.  We ate a great meal, and he dropped me off back at the hotel.  No charge.  What the hell!! Take my $20!!!  Nope.  Ok fine, howabout $40, and you show me the Mayan Volcano and all the cool stuff around here tomorrow?  He accepted.  \n\nNext morning comes around, he shows up at my hotel.  We take off and he takes me to these Dutch church ruins that got decimated by a volcanic eruption in the 1600's or 1700's, hiked all around these awesome caves, and strolled around the black sand beaches.  We had a hell of a time.  I give him $60 USD (hid another $20 behind another $20 lol; as the bills were crisp enough that you can kind of make it seem like one bill).\n\nHe discovered this as I was walking away and I laughed at him and waved back... he had no choice but to keep it.  I wished him and his family well.  He is/was a good person.\n\nWe kept in touch via email, except he didn't have his own computer, nor did he have his own email address (he wasn't tech savvy).

I convince him he can\u2019t afford a car accident than either and it will only take a moment for me to hail him a cab. (Oh this is before Uber.) he concedes and in under a min. I grab him a cab and tell the cabbie to take him to Mercy hospital. (the closest in the area.) At this point, he\u2019s doing much worse. So I hand the cabbie $20 and tell him to rush. The next day the guy comes back for his car and to thank me. He was having some sort of respiratory attack and would have surely died without medical treatment. He tried to pay me the twenty back and at that point his tears have me really choking up and I refused his money telling him \u201cto pay it to the hospital $5 at a time, that will keep the hospital off your back for at least four months.\u201d  After a million \u201cthank you\u201ds and \u201cI owe you my life\u201ds he drives away never to be seen again. \n\nTL;DR: don\u2019t assume shit about anyone, and be nice to each other.

About 10 minutes later, a stranger walked over to me, held her hand out and helped me get up. She then led me to a bench and sat me down. She hugged me and rubbed my back. She let me cry and would say to  me\n \" this too shall pass\". After about 15 minutes, I composed myself (as much as possible) and she smiled, got up and continued on her walk. I truly believe she was my guardian angel. I think about that moment all the time."

Here are some starter questions that will actually be a huge problem if you think about it:\n    \n- How will you get clean drinking water?\n    \n- How will you get electricity?\n    \n- Gasoline will \"go bad\" in no more than a year's time, so how will you get from place to place with no gas?  Diesel will last longer, but not much more than 2-3 years unless you treat it.\n    \n- Where will you get food?  And how?  Do you actually know how to grow crops?  Do you know how to butcher animals without doing things like puncturing their intestine and poisoning the whole carcass?  If you don't know, how will you learn?\n    \n- Where will you live?  The Midwest is a great place to grow crops and raise livestock, but you'll need a LOT of heating in the wintertime.  The West Coast doesn't have a heating problem, but it DOES have a food supply problem, unless you're going to grow crops in city parks or something.\n    \nAnyway, you get the gist.  I starting thinking about this problem in the early 90s, when all this stuff wasn't part of pop culture.  I've absolutely spend thousands of hours thinking about it.  Not because I think it's going to happen (it's not), but because it's an amazing thought exercise and learning process if you do it seriously.",

Drunk uncles and cousins end up on the roof (there have been injuries) making reindeer stomping noises and the young kids really get excited. I\u2019m mid 50s and this has been a tradition well before I was born.  \n\nI have a ton of stories about Santa on xmas eve.    One of the most memorable a few years ago when one of my cousins kids played Santa.   His girlfriend went up to sit on Santa\u2019s lap and get her gift.  She didn\u2019t know it was him at first. The gift she opened was her ring and he proposed.  It was really sweet but it took her forever to say yes.  I thought for a few minutes she was going to say no.  In front of his entire extended family.  So Santa got his wish this time.\n\nAnother cousin ended up becoming a professional Santa... real beard and all.   He is the official Santa of some major Xmas events in our area and is on local TV and radio. (Off topic... sorry... I just love the fact this is my family member). He\u2019s an Uber driver as well and drives in full Santa garb during the holidays. \n\nI love my family  \u2764\ufe0f",

            "/r/fedlegs\n\nIt is a subreddit dedicated to the fetish (of one man? [/u/jimthefeeder](https://www.reddit.com/u/jimthefeeder)) of women with their legs painted yellow. Not the torso, not the feet, just the legs, and specifically the color yellow. It is named fedlegs because the fictional process for getting their legs yellowed is known as \"Feeding The Legs\" All in all, a very benign fetish, but the lore of the creator is what I think makes this a real contender. Below are the highlights from the [stickied post on the subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fedlegs/comments/8xzk6a/fedleg_explanation_updated_due_to_expanding/) detailing his creation, implementation, and outcome of the \"Leg Feeding Procedure\", along with the Dr. Fedleg Universe, which is a parallel universe to our own. \n\n \u2022 Wondered if it was possible to create a fetish from scratch. Based on what I've read it's a mix of: light bondage, leggings, orgasm denial, and ownership/marking in the vein of The Scarlet Letter (I assume that's a fetish, I don't know if there's an exact term for it.)\n\n \u2022 He has an detailed universe of how the system works. Who/Why people get \"Fedlegged\". Mostly based on the kind of clothing they wear. If they've got their legs visible to be seen, they're getting \"Fedlegged\". \n\n \u2022 In universe, everyone is aware of Doctor Fedleg, (full name Charles Fed Ostrog), the person who got the process of leg painting legalized; he has the government's support. He developed sustainable clean/renewable energy which is why he's successful. \n\n \u2022 He never wishes to see women injured/beat/hurt during the process.\n\n \u2022 \"His reasoning is a mystery, but the one thing for certain is that it has nothing to do with religion.\" - actual line in the writing.\n\n \u2022 On the 2014 midterm elections, prosecution for Dr. Fedleg was added onto the ballot; people voted against prosecuting him due to his successful ocean clean up act. \n\n \u2022 Dr. Fedleg has various kinds of paints that last certain durations. He also has a blend of the paint that can stop excessively revealing women, slutty, or rude women from having orgasms. Dr. Fedleg is the only person with permission to apply this special paint. \n\nRegardless, I find the whole thing fascinating. What led to creation of the character? Why create this universe to have it all work? Why does Dr. Fedleg care about the environment so much? Is it to be relatable to other people that might stumble across this, or is it the author inserting his own beliefs into the lore? Why did he choose the 2014 midterm election? The post was written in July of 2018, so the closest upcoming midterm election would have been 4 months away, but he instead chose to go back to 2014, which I think would indicate he's been thinking about this for a while. In general I just have a lot of questions.",

            "\"Free internet for life\" and a year's supply of Coca-Cola checking in.\n\nI got the free internet through an Oak Ridge National Labs (ORNL) program for middle school students in 1994 (Sacam). I used it consistently for something like 10 years but at that point dial-up was so far behind Cable or DSL that I just kind of stopped using it. I honestly don't know if it would even work any more as I've had no reason to try it.\n\nThe free Coke products was a little weirder--basically when I was attending university I noticed that the Coca-Cola I bought near the school just SUCKED. Like it didn't taste like Coca-Cola at all, more like an RC mixed with Pepsi. I commented on this to all my friends and they had no clue what I was talking about but I could blind test cokes from home versus \"university cokes\" and get it right every time. Eventually I sent an e-mail to Coca-Cola basically just asking why the Cokes in Cookeville sucked so much and could they fix it. They (quite surprisingly) took it really seriously and asked for numbers off of the affected cans tracked it down to the bottler (canner?) and had it fixed within 6 weeks. Sent me a stack of just hundreds of silver \"free 12 pack of any coke product\" coupons and thanked me for my time...\n\nWorked out great. Still had over a hundred of them left at the end of the year.",

They sent me back a box of 400 coupons, each good for a pack of M&Ms.\n\nI love M&Ms, but after the first 30 or 40 packs, I started to get a little tired of them. I'd take some coupons with me every time I went grocery shopping, and if I saw kids not being brats, I'd go up to their parents and offer them some coupons to give their kids M&Ms. A few thought I was weird or something, but most parents and kids were happy to get them.\n\nI also gave out multiple regular size packs for Halloween that year.

When the cops arrived at the scene, she was stark naked, putting her ass out the window. I told the cops my side of the story, as soon as she picked up my name she started moaning it to the point of waking up nearby neighbours.

I basically said \"well lucky for me, I was planning on quitting anyways, good luck with the floor change\" and walked out. Went and got a biscuit breakfast, went home, and got in bed."

            "Years ago I worked overnight at a homeless shelter for men. A good portion of the regular guys that stayed there had mental health and/or drug problems. There were a lot of fights and the occasional stabbing, but for the most part everyone was relatively behaved and most were good people at heart. I received a lot of threats, but one ever acted on them.\n\nOne night when I arrived for my shift I noticed there was a much larger police presence than usual. I walked into our office and the officer in charged started asking me if I had noticed a guy, \"Richard\", behaving unusually at all lately. I had not saw anything out of the ordinary and I told them such. I looked at the dorm list and noted that he was marked as no longer staying at the shelter. He was a long term resident so I thought this was odd.\n\nThe police left without telling me anything except the fact they needed security footage from 2 specific cameras from the night before. I did not work the night before and the guy I normally work with pulled a no show. We were the only 2 people besides the manager, who was on a holiday, that were trained on how to burn footage to a DVD.\n\nI spent the rest of my shift in shock. When I found the footage they were looking for I felt physically ill. \"Richard\" had gone out onto the second floor smoking deck, finished a cigarette, got up on the railing, and dove head first onto the cement below.\n\nThe first camera on the second floor showed him jump, but the second camera on the first floor was much more gruesome. He landed head first and rolled over in a way that he was staring right into the camera as he lay there dieing. I quickly put the footage on DVD and went to throw up.\n\nI was given the next day off. No counseling. No nothing. I will never forget that one. He was a pretty good dude as far as I knew him. Some mental issues, but no one knew he was suicidal or why he did it.",
            "So many of these will give me nightmares so I'll throw one in the mix that I never want to forget. \nA year back I was working at a hostel and we have security cameras throughout the building. Watching the footage from the camera in the kitchen. It is about 2 am and a very drunk guest walks in, grabs some snacks. and accidentally drops an empty bottle on the ground. He then proceeds to kick it up into the air then kick it again in air, where it flys across the entire length of the room perfectly into the recycling bin. In his drunken state he threw up his hands, ran around in a circle clearly in shock at how amazing he is. Then after looking around he noticed there was noone their to see it. After that he looked visibly depressed and stumbled back out of the kitchen",
            "Kid pooped in an isle of Walmart and an old lady slipped in it",
            "Working in a rehearsal studio for bands we had camera at the front desk that pointed down the hall with the entrances to all the rooms. \n\nOne day I\u2019m sitting there minding my own business and noticed there was a girl sitting in the hallway outside one of the studios. She had come in with the band that was practicing and I just assumed she didn\u2019t feel like sitting in the loud space with the band. So I got up and went to tell her she was welcome to sit in the lobby where there was a couch and tv. I got around the corner and she wasn\u2019t there. I went back the desk and there she was, sitting in the hall waiting outside the room. So I went back out to find her not there again. \n\nI assumed she had gone into the room so I went and knocked and they informed me that the girl had left a while before, just after they had gotten started practicing. So I went back and there she was, still on the camera.\n\nIt was only then that I realized I had accidentally bumped the freeze frame button for the monitor...",
            "I used to do asset protection for a Walmart in a very heroin addicted area. The creepiest thing was seeing how fast someone would go from completely normal to absolutely out of it in the span of a year because of the drug. You could build a timeline of their demise through CCTV pictures and video.\n\nOne man in particular really stood out to me. The first time I apprehended him he was very polite and intelligent. Just stealing to get his fix. A year later and the fourth time I caught him he was basically a shell of a man. He tried running from me and I looked him right in the eyes and said \"I know you, Gary Last Name, please don't run.\" The look on his face of someone knowing him who he couldn't even remember will always stay with me.",
            "Not necessarily creepy, but I work on security for a popular UK supermarket and came into work one day to find a note asking me to burn an incident off the cameras onto disk. It was something from the car park he previous night, so I figured we'd had a shoplifter in or an accident in the car park, but no, it wasn't anything as pleasant as that. We'd had a situation where a couple (older white gentleman and youngish Asian female) had been in-store and the night security guy just thought they were acting a bit funny, so he follows them round store on CCTV in-store to see if anything went on. Nothing really happens during this time, though the guy seems to become more and more aggravated.\n \nThey go outside having purchased their shopping to pack it into the car boot, when a clear argument occurs between them. He suddenly turns round, kicks the empty trolley across the car park and then smacks her full force in the face outta seemingly nowhere. She recoils in pain, a bit more shouting takes place but she seems to dutifully take her seat in the passenger seat despite what just took place. \n\nDuring the process of burning this to disk for the Police, since our security guy had called it in as an assault, I had to rewatch the moment where he hits her over and over again, but watch helplessly as she seems to calmly get into the car of the man who just assaulted her. Long story short, she was a mail order bride who was trafficked here and as well as assault he got done for people trafficking, so a pretty wholesome ending to an otherwise awful story.",
            "When I worked as a security officer it was my first week on the job I watched my boss and another officer try to talk a guy off of the top of our parking structure.  Didn't work watched him jump off and land next to an employee who was coming in for her shift. Guy hit the ground so hard it exploded the belt right off of his pants. I will never forget watching that.",
            "I\u2019m not in security but I work for a bank and part of my job is checking the cameras in the morning for pings overnight, and then making sure all the pings were just squirrels or leaves etc. Last week I saw a ping on our back entrance camera and when I went to watch the video, it was a guy I didn\u2019t recognize walking back and forth in front of the door at 3am for a solid 20 minutes. Like just pacing the whole time, and every couple minutes he\u2019d stop and walk up to the door and stare into the camera. Then he\u2019d go back to pacing. A car eventually went by and that must\u2019ve set something in him off because he legit ran away and didn\u2019t come back. We ended up calling the cops about it but I still have no idea who he was or what his deal was.",
            "One time there was a spider on the lens. It was big... it stayed there for like 3 days.",
            "Was watching cctv footage of a parking deck, and on the ninth level there\u2019s this guy sitting in the middle of the deck, banging his head on one of the pillars. All of a sudden the guy just stops, and runs to the edge. Without stopping or jumping, he flings himself over the edge. I immediately call dispatch and told them what had happened. Few days later I was offered counseling for those events"

            "My father and I were following a trail for a while so we decided to take a break and catch our breaths, I sat on a log off the trail and my dad stood on the edge of the trail waiting for me to get up. I hear some movement and scan around and I see a man, dress casually, walking quickly down the trail with a Glock in his hand. He is not really following the trail, he is just walking toward my dad with haste. Before he comes up to my dad, he asks if he's seen anything(pretty normal). I keep an eye on him because I don't believe he was there to hunt, I think he was there to make sure my dad hadn't seen anything he wasn't supposed to. He wasn't dressed like a hunter, he didn't walk like a hunter, and It was deer season and he decided he would take his Glock out to get a deer... I wasn't buying, so I put a round in the chamber and watched them talk. He seemed to be confident until my dad mentioned that he was here with me and gestured in my direction. I nodded and made a half-assed wave. And he seemed to lose interest in us and ended the conversation shortly after and turned around and walked back the way he came, just about as fast as he walked up to us. It worried us a bit but we continued on. We haven't been back to that area in a while. My dad told me that there have been drug busts near that area in the past. This isn't a supernatural tale, just an experience that made me not want to go back to that area. ",
            "A long time ago my grandparents bought a small cabin in the woods in Pennsylvania. My dad, uncle, and aunt are all small children. My father told me this story. They're all sitting around outside with a small fire going when they hear branches breaking and footsteps coming from the darkness. They think it's a black bear because it's close but they can't see it. It's seems to be going straight for my uncle, the littlest of the children. He starts panicking while everyone tells him not to move. Now this big black beast is within arms reach of him and he's shaking like a leaf with his eyes closed. All of a sudden it opens it's jaws and starts licking his face.. turns out that the next property over is owned by a couple who raise Newfoundland dogs and one got out.",
            "My family owns a couple hundred acres of forest in eastern NC. No one lives on the property anymore, and hasn\u2019t for the last six or seven years. \n\n\nWe went down there to do some target shooting in October of 2017, and I decided to go walk through the outskirts of the woods to locate a good limb for our range marker. As I\u2019m walking, literally and proverbially kicking rocks I come across a fairly nice, but practically brand new looking suitcase, full of clothes and other personal effects. No ID, nothing with any sort of identifying markers on them. But seemed to be clothes for four people; two kids and two adults, one male and one female. Had some food, coloring books, etc. there was a makeshift lean-to about 100 yards farther into the woods. \n\n\nSet up a trail camera and left it there for three weeks, never saw anyone. \n\n\n\nFor reference, this is 35 miles from any sizable town or city. ",
            "I've got one good one.  I have a hunting spot that I frequent.  Not crazy far off the grid or anything like that, terrain is a pain in the ass, but it's a pretty hidden spot that is close to my house.  \n\nAnyway, I hunt a lot of small game there and see a ton of mule deer any time I go out.  One morning I get there about 530am, and have some time to kill before I start my hike in.  I have an odd feeling in the parking lot but just chalk it up to too much coffee on an empty stomach giving me anxiety.  So, I decide to start hiking in and about 300 yards into my hike I notice this pile of downed trees/branches/general debris that I hadn't seen before.  It was my first time hunting this particular place this particular season, so I figure some folks came out and did some fire mitigation work.  I don't pay too much attention to it until I notice there's an odd amount of movement coming from it.  Pretty small movements, but it sticks out when a brush pile is wiggling on a still day.  It was also about 545am, and the wilderness just sort of has this stillness to it at that time that any movement is noticeable.  \n\nSo, I stop and start examining the pile to figure out what's going on.  I figure there's a rabbit in there, maybe some squirrels.  I figure I've hit the jackpot and I'm definitely about to bag something.  I start deciding the best way to flush whatever is going on in there and still have my shotgun up in time to take a good shot.  I realize I'm standing by a decent sized branch, and my best move is to just stomp on the branch.  If all goes according to plan, everything will freeze, then whatever is in there will dart out.  I try to figure out where the rabbit will come out of, get ready, and BAM I stomp on the branch and snap it in half. \n\nThe pile goes still, and that stillness and quiet is back.  Then, a mountain lion, with a bloody nose and mouth, pops up out of the pile.  At this point, I'm about 10 yards from the pile.  I have my shotgun, but really don't want to shoot the lion.  I also don't want to fire a shot off in the air to scare it, because all in all this was a pretty cool experience that very few people get to have.  \n\nIt froze and was looking at me very quizzically.  Then, in one quick motion it hopped out of the brush pile, ran up hill, got about 40 yards from me, and disappeared into the trees.  I've never seen something cover 40 yards uphill in such a fast, graceful way.  One of the cooler things I've ever gotten to experience.\n\nI went to check out the brush pile when it left, and sure enough it was feasting on a mule deer.  Still my favorite out in the woods story I ever tell.",
            "I work in the woods for a living  and I\u2019ve seen a fair amount of odd things... Carvings in trees, old beat up cars, random weird trash scattered through the woods, and a fair amount of animal carcasses. I\u2019ve had instances where I\u2019ve gotten spooked, stuff like jumping big critters is always quite jolting, but I can recall one rather butt puckering experience. I was working with a few other people at the time, spaced out of sight but not out of ear shot. I crossed over a little ridge atleast 2 miles from the closest road, in the middle of the woods, and I saw what looked like a full skeleton of a cow tied together with twigs and a little bit of twine. Who ever made it had fashioned it to be sitting on a log. They left a very neat pile of bones in front of the thing, and nothing anywhere else. I saw it and about fainted.   Definitely really fucking odd considering how far we were off the road, and how thick and steep it was. I ended up getting the folks I was with to come check it out, really just for shits and giggles. I took note of it and we moved on to the next plots. I have a picture, but I\u2019m new to this whole reddit thing so I\u2019ll try to figure out how to upload it.\n\n\nEdit: [picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/Idyz0ES) \n\nEdit: Shoot dang strangers!

            "There is a place in Kingston, Idaho or the otherside of Fernan Saddle- depending on which way you go to get there. I call it the snake pit, and no I don't mean the restaurant. I still visit the area now once in a while and camp there. Anyways next to where I camp in the trees is a basin, and it has a bunch of old 1920s-1930's rotted cars in it, overgrown by bushes and trees but sunlight falls on the cars. First time I camped out there I walked into those woods and the leaves all started to move. The snakes were running from me while they were sunbathing on the cars. Fuckin creeeeped me out. I don't go in there for wood anymore and I don't see the snakes leave that spot so I just let them be. ",
            "When I was a kid, a poacher must have thought I was a deer or something and shot a round at me. It impacted on a tree above my head. I immediately fired three shots as fast as I could, not at the shooter but in the air. In my hunting group, immediate three shots means \"HELP\" basically. My dad and our hunting club immediately came out to find out what the fuck happened by honking the horns of their trucks letting me know they were coming. I basically laid on the ground until I could tell they were near the dirt road. Told them what happened and guessed it was probably a road poacher trying to get a deer as it came from the same road. They didn't see him. It was private property and we were always very aware of who was at what location and who was hunting where. Nobody was suppose to be in the part I was at.\n\nScared the shit out of me. This was mid-90s. Reason why I don't like hunting on public property is cause of that and I don't know the people out there.",
            "Not a hunter but I go backpacking and fishing quite a bit. I have an irrational fear of bears, and waking up to bear tracks around my camp was quite unsettling and I did not spend much more time in the area.\n\nI\u2019ve also had a creepy encounter with an overly friendly deer. I was in a pretty isolated area so I thought it was odd to see a deer that was so calm around humans, this deer would not leave me alone it walked around my camp all day and came back at night to scare the shit out of me by laying down outside my tent.",

You decide to troll the film world by making a movie so ridiculous anybody defending it would look like a tool. What's your plotline?:\n\n\n\n> On the surface it looks like a period piece set in the 60's -70's. A man in prison (Joeseph Gordon Levitt) struggling with depression. In his cell, contemplating suicide, he begins recounting his troubled childhood to his cellmate, Micheal Cane.\n\n> We go quickly through his younger life, a child on a farm with 4 siblings, a strict father and a distant mother. The family moves to the city, where he gets bullied for being a hick. He finds solace reading old military books. Using tactics from his book, he and a group of misfit friends defeat the bullies.\n\n> Cut to prison where he is still considering suicide, staring at a homemade noose. Michael Cane urges him to continue.\n\n> He then relates dropping out of school, and traveling with some hippies led by Ellen Page, whom he is in love with. She flirts but keeps him at a distance. He has a knack for painting. This act focuses on his pursuit of Page, trying to get close to her through art until it is revealed she is a lesbian, when he walks in on her with another woman. \n\n> Dejected, he leaves the group.\n\n> He tries to get into a prestigious art college to avoid the draft but is rejected. He gets drafted. Standard military \"War is Hell\" montage interspersed with him in prison crying. Cane is not consoling, but tells him some wise Michael Cane words about life being a struggle and it is our choice to live or die.\n\n> He gets out and on a chance encounter meets back up with Page. She is now part of a political activist group. Having nowhere to go he joins them. With his strict fathers upbringing, love of history, charisma and military service he becomes the face of the group. They plan to hold a huge rally. At the rally he gets arrested. At trial, Page backstabs him to get her charges dropped, and he gets 5 years.\n\n> Back to Cane and Levitt. Hes been in jail almost a year and is considering suicide. Cane, who we thought all along was talking him down, is actually urging him to hang himself. A back and forth of dialog ensues, culminating in Cane attacking Levitt and putting the nose around his neck. Levitt, now wanting to live,fights him off. Just then the guards appear to break up the fight. They also announce he is getting early release.\n\n> Cut to Levitt being released from prison. Making his way down a long hallway. He passes by Canes cell, where he has a defeated look on his face. The camra lingers on the cell and Cane says to someone offscreen. \"I've failed. I tried to stop you but I've failed. Father help us all.\" Camera pans to reveal Ellen Page, in the shadows smirking in the corner of the jail cell.\n\n> As Levitt exits the prison a sepia tone takes over the screen. We see we are not in 1970's America, but 1920's Berlin. As Levitt walks down the street a free man, we see brief shots from his past, redone in a style appropriate for the 20's. All scenes with Ellen Pages have her replaced with Cillian Murphy. He enters a beer hall and is greated by cheers from his former protesters, now wearing swastika armbands.\n\n> You realize you just spent 2 and a half hours rooting for Hitler.",

            "Post by u/sozaiix3:\n\nI have this comment saved too, it's from a askreddit thread very long ago I don't have the source anymore, very insightful, here's a similar one about growing old:\n\nI asked my grandpa what it felt like to grow old. Grandpa is a man who will deliberate on which part of the newspaper to start with each morning, so I knew my question would take him some time to answer. I said nothing. I let him gather his thoughts.\n\nWhen I was a boy, Grandpa had once complimented me on this habit. He told me it was good that I asked a question and gave a person silence. And being that any compliment from him was so few and far between, this habit soon became a part of my personality and one that served me well.\n\nGrandpa stared out the window and looked at the empty bird feeder that hung from an overgrown tree next to the pond he built in the spring of 1993. For twenty years, Grandpa filled up the feeder each evening. But he stopped doing it last winter when walking became too difficult for him.\n\nWithout ever taking his eyes from the window, he asked me a question: \u201cHave you ever been in a hot shower when the water ran cold?\u201d I told him I had.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what aging feels like. In the beginning of your life it\u2019s like you\u2019re standing in a hot shower. At first the water is too warm, but you eventually grow used to the heat and begin enjoying it. But you take it for granted when you\u2019re young and think it\u2019s going to be this way forever. Life goes on like this for some time.\u201d\n\nGrandpa looked at me with those eyes that had seen so much change in this world. He smiled and winked at me.\n\n\u201cAnd if you\u2019re lucky, a few good looking women will join you in the shower from time to time.\u201d\n\nWe laughed. He looked out the window and continued on.\n\n\u201cYou begin to feel it in your forties and fifties. The water temperature declines just the slightest bit. It\u2019s almost imperceptible, but you know it happened and you know what it means. You try to pretend like you didn\u2019t feel it, but you still turn the faucet up to stay warm. But the water keeps going lukewarm. One day you realize the faucet can\u2019t go any further, and from here on out the temperature begins to drop. And everyday you feel the warmth gradually leaving your body.\u201d\n\nGrandpa cleared his throat and pulled a stained handkerchief from his flannel shirt pocket. He blew his nose, balled up the handkerchief, and put it back in his pocket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rather helpless feeling, truth told. The water is still pleasant, but you know it will soon become cold and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. This is the point when some people decide to leave the shower on their own terms. They know it's never going to get warmer, so why prolong the inevitable? I was able to stay in because I contented myself recalling the showers of my youth. I lived a good life, but still wish I hadn\u2019t taken my youth for granted. But it\u2019s too late now. No matter how hard I try, I know I\u2019ll never get the hot water back on again.\u201d\n\nHe paused for a few moments and kept looking out the window with those eyes that had seen ninety-one years on this Earth. Those eyes that lived through the Great Depression, those eyes that beheld the Pacific Ocean in World War II, those eyes that saw the birth of his three children, five grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.\n\nHe had indeed lived a good life, I thought to myself.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what it feels like to grow old.\u201d\n\nEdit: Link to thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5cwzhn/comment/da0m5q2",

            "Posted by u/rhoner about 6 years ago. \n\nThis is just the absolute best thing I've come across on reddit. (this and the rice kid) \n\nGonna copypasta it as it is :\n\nJust about every time I see someone I stop. I kind of got out of the habit in the last couple of years, moved to a big city and all that, my girlfriend wasn't too stoked on the practice. Then some shit happened to me that changed me and I am back to offering rides habitually. If you would indulge me, it is long story and has almost nothing to do with hitch hiking other than happening on a road.\n\nThis past year I have had 3 instances of car trouble. A blow out on a freeway, a bunch of blown fuses and an out of gas situation. All of them were while driving other people's cars which, for some reason, makes it worse on an emotional level. It makes it worse on a practical level as well, what with the fact that I carry things like a jack and extra fuses in my car, and know enough not to park, facing downhill, on a steep incline with less than a gallon of fuel.\n\nAnyway, each of these times this shit happened I was DISGUSTED with how people would not bother to help me. I spent hours on the side of the freeway waiting, watching roadside assistance vehicles blow past me, for AAA to show. The 4 gas stations I asked for a gas can at told me that they couldn't loan them out \"for my safety\" but I could buy a really shitty 1-gallon one with no cap for $15. It was enough, each time, to make you say shit like \"this country is going to hell in a handbasket.\"\n\nBut you know who came to my rescue all three times? Immigrants. Mexican immigrants. None of them spoke a lick of the language. But one of those dudes had a profound affect on me.\n\nHe was the guy that stopped to help me with a blow out with his whole family of 6 in tow. I was on the side of the road for close to 4 hours. Big jeep, blown rear tire, had a spare but no jack. I had signs in the windows of the car, big signs that said NEED A JACK and offered money. No dice. Right as I am about to give up and just hitch out there a van pulls over and dude bounds out. He sizes the situation up and calls for his youngest daughter who speaks english. He conveys through her that he has a jack but it is too small for the Jeep so we will need to brace it. He produces a saw from the van and cuts a log out of a downed tree on the side of the road. We rolled it over, put his jack on top, and bam, in business. I start taking the wheel off and, if you can believe it, I broke his tire iron. It was one of those collapsible ones and I wasn't careful and I snapped the head I needed clean off. Fuck.\n\nNo worries, he runs to the van, gives it to his wife and she is gone in a flash, down the road to buy a tire iron. She is back in 15 minutes, we finish the job with a little sweat and cussing (stupid log was starting to give), and I am a very happy man. We are both filthy and sweaty. The wife produces a large water jug for us to wash our hands in. I tried to put a 20 in the man's hand but he wouldn't take it so I instead gave it to his wife as quietly as I could. I thanked them up one side and down the other. I asked the little girl where they lived, thinking maybe I could send them a gift for being so awesome. She says they live in Mexico. They are here so mommy and daddy can pick peaches for the next few weeks. After that they are going to pick cherries then go back home. She asks if I have had lunch and when I told her no she gave me a tamale from their cooler, the best fucking tamale I have ever had.\n\nSo, to clarify, a family that is undoubtedly poorer than you, me, and just about everyone else on that stretch of road, working on a seasonal basis where time **is** money, took an hour or two out of their day to help some strange dude on the side of the road when people in tow trucks were just passing me by. Wow...\n\nBut we aren't done yet. I thank them again and walk back to my car and open the foil on the tamale cause I am starving at this point and what do I find inside? My fucking $20 bill! I whirl around and run up to the van and the guy rolls his window down. He sees the $20 in my hand and just shaking his head no like he won't take it. All I can think to say is \"Por Favor, Por Favor, Por Favor\" with my hands out. Dude just smiles, shakes his head and, with what looked like great concentration, tried his hardest to speak to me in English:\n\n\"Today you.... tomorrow me.\"\n\nRolled up his window, drove away, his daughter waving to me in the rear view. I sat in my car eating the best fucking tamale of all time and I just cried. Like a little girl. It has been a rough year and nothing has broke my way. This was so out of left field I just couldn't deal.\n\nIn the 5 months since I have changed a couple of tires, given a few rides to gas stations and, once, went 50 miles out of my way to get a girl to an airport. I won't accept money. Every time I tell them the same thing when we are through:\n\n\"Today you.... tomorrow me.\"\n\ntl;dr: long rambling story about how the kindness of strangers, particularly folks from south of the border, forced me to be more helpful on the road and in life in general. I am sure it won't be as meaningful to anyone else but it was seriously the highlight of my 2010.\n",
            "From \"what's the laziest thing you've ever done?\" courtesy of /u/TupperWolf\n\n> Late to the party but this one is too good to pass up:\n> \n> I was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in.  This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel.  He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious.  My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face.  He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today.  It's painful to watch.\n> \n> But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge.  In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says \"heeeey.  It's OPS.  Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five.  Thanks.\" And puts the phone down.  And then he just sits there.  Squinting.  Waiting.\n>   \n> And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him.  After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me.  By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face.  He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel.  I am in awe.  \n> \n> He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour).  But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel."

They usually have an entrance with a security guard somewhere, but we couldn't immediately locate it. So I came up with an idea.\n\nSince I had my legit wristband on, I had nothing to lose. So I just pretended to be really drunk, having stumbled into the backstage by accident while trying to find a place to pee.

My parents refused to buy me a new one because *I* broke my new monitor. It wasn't my fault!  \n\n\nSo being the bored kid I was, I just did my best to use it anyway. I remember it so very clearly. I was playing Warrock, and the screen blacked out right before a firefight and got me killed. I was like alright, if my parents won't buy me a new one since this is half working, so I'll just break it completely. Without a second though, I punched it in the center right then and there. This fixed the monitor. There was discoloration around where I punched it and a line through the middle, but no more random colors, no more flickering.   \n\n\nA few years later I got a new monitor and my dad was going to take my old one. I moved it from my computer to his, and when I first set it up, the colors were all messed up. I told him I knew how to fix it. I punched it again expecting it to break, they all looked at me like I was insane and asked what the hell I was doing. It worked. It still works. 12 years later and he's still using the same monitor with the line going through it where I punched it.",

I\u2019m not complaining\u2014 it gave me a few extra days to talk to her and tell her how much I loved her and listen to her talk with the little energy she had.\n\nBecause of that, I had burned through my clean clothes and needed to do some laundry. Problem is, as I was staying in my grandmother\u2019s home and no one had lived there in a while, there was no detergent. \n\nAs I was stepping out the door to head to the store, I remembered my grandmother kept a huge coupon binder on the dinette table. It was a hobby for her\u2014 clipping and sorting coupons for shit she\u2019d never buy.  \n\nSo I open the cover and right there on the first page, there\u2019s a pocket absolutely brimming with Tide coupons. I\u2019m sure 90% of them were expired, but I grabbed the wad and left. \n\nI bypass Walmart and head to the only other grocery store in town\u2014 this small squatty dump of a building which looks like a relic from the 60\u2019s. I go in, grab the detergent and head to the counter. \n\nThere\u2019s no one in line and the cashier, a homely stick-thin red-headed girl, looks like she\u2019s going to die from boredom. \n\n\u201cThis it?\u201d\n\n*\u201dThat\u2019s it.

See, usually accept three of the same coupon, but seein\u2019 as it\u2019s Double-Your-Savings-Saturday, I can run \u2018em twice.\u201d \n\nEach time she swipes the coupon, the register chirps pleasantly.

            " Both of the stories I'm sharing occurred during the Nepal Earthquake of 2015. \n\nFirst was an infant who had a roof fall on  his head. He was trapped for 10 min. before being rescued and took  another 3 hours to drive him to the nearest functioning hospital (this  happened in a remote area and he was brought in a taxi). His face was so  swollen that it was probably more than double its original size. The  top of his head was completely flat (like a dinner plate) and he had [raccoon eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon_eyes).  But somehow he was showing no danger signs and his vitals were normal. A  CT scan miraculously showed that there was no brain damage or even an  actual fracture, he had something called a [Ping- pong fracture](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ping-pong-skull-fracture). The child recovered pretty well and was discharged in a couple of days.\n\nSecond  was a lady who was roughly 8 months pregnant. Again, the roof of her  house fell on her, sadly on her belly. From what she said, she was stuck  under the rubble for about 4 hours, and it took a further 2-3 days to  airlift her to the hospital. An x-ray of the pelvis was done which  showed that it was broken badly  in at least 4 places. But miraculously  enough, there was very minimal bleeding. Someone with pelvis fracture  can bleed to death easily, and she had multiple fractures in her pelvis.  Nobody can say what happened for sure, but it was thought that probably  the weight of the rubble was so strong that it actually helped stop the  bleeding due to the applied pressure. More miraculously enough, the  baby showed no signs of injury or even stress, even though the roof fell  straight on her belly, and was delivered healthily via C- section.",

She fell off a horse in grade 8 while riding competitive and legit snapped her spine, and was in a very intense back brace for her entire high school career.... and my god the other girls were so nasty to her. She would get made fun of for her appearance and there was an incident where someone filmed her in class without her knowledge and then edited the video to have all these sexual innuendos around her back brace and it was posted on Facebook. Our principal was also a horrible woman and when the video got reported to the principal, the principal somehow blamed this girl instead of penalizing the bully. She ended up having to stay back a year because her disability was so bad and she couldn't complete her school work and was unable to graduate. She was incredibly religious as well and other girls used to make weird christian incest jokes about her mom having to bathe her (because she couldn't bathe herself due to her back brace).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, she's now doing some fancy medical degree in the UK and is pain free and out of the back brace. She looks amazing (healthy, glowing) and rigorously kicks ass at the gym every day to physically rehabilitate her body. The best part of the story is that she has absolutely no ill-will to the girls who bullied her. It upset her at the time but she didn't let it scar her -- she knew that her bullies were obviously insecure and dealing with some inner demons if they went out of their way to ruin her life. She felt bad for them more than anything. I run into her at the gym all the time and it's so nice to see her so confident and thriving!",

            "My husband graduated from a fancy prep school. Literally over 90% of his class are lawyers and doctors now. To his parents disdain, my husband became a professional poker player. Whenever he goes to reunions there\u2019s a circle of these super successful doctors and lawyers around him because they\u2019d rather listen to his stories.\n\n**EDIT.** This blew up overnight. To answer some of the questions:\n\n**How can you be a professional at something that's based on luck and chance?** There's a lot more than meets the eye, \"hunches\" and \"gut feelings\" are a very small part of poker. It's a very mathematical, probabilities-driven game. If you're curious, consider looking up game theory branch of mathematics, and specifically as it pertains to poker. If you are very curious and technically minded, pick up a copy of \"Mathematics of Poker\" by Bill Chen and Jerrod Ankenman.\n\n**How much does he make?** A whole lot more than me, and I have a decent job (not a doctor or a lawyer though.) It's a mixed bag of feelings to come home from a frustrating day to see that he's won my monthly salary.\n\n**What's the biggest he's won / lost at once?** He's won a tournament for just under a million, and I believe he had about 25-30% of himself at the time. He's had a few more low-mid six-figure scores with various amounts of himself. When I talk about having \"percent of himself\" - as someone brushed upon it, a lot of the players swap or \"sell their action.\" The way it works is that you cover a part of someone's tournament buy-in with a little mark up (for the work they're putting in plus their \"edge\") and in return if they win some money, they then pay you back that percentage of their prize. This allows people to play bigger tournaments than they would if they had to pay it all themselves. As far as how much he's lost at once - there isn't a lot of losing an obscene amount at once in tournament poker. I think at some point he's entered a $10,000 tourney without selling any action. It's more about how many tournaments in a row you play without winning or cashing any. He's been fortunate not to have any super crazy downswings. *knocks on wood.*\n\n**It's not a real / useful job.** I don't entirely disagree, and neither does my husband. It's a common struggle among the players. Some try to add value to the world by accumulating as much as they can through poker and then donating a lot to charity. Others consider it a step in their life that then opens up opportunity to focus on other, non-zero-sum ventures. But two more points to consider. One: how many \"regular\" jobs are actually making the world a better place, and how many are neutral-to-harmful? Even lawyers can range from doing a ton of good in the world to bringing a lot of harm. Two: if you could sit in the comfort of your own home, no boss, no schedule, play a game you love and rake in enough to make a living and then some, would you say no to that because it's not a real, value-making job? I'd like to say that I would, but I'm not sure.\n\n**I sympathize with his parents.** I love his parents, they are amazing people. I should mention that in the 12 years that husband's been doing this, they've mostly come around and are proud of him. I've personally taken of time to make sure his mom knows enough about poker to understand that part of his life. Every few months, his dad still reminds him that he can take his LSATs any time though."

He started to yell and scream if I didn\u2019t give him money to buy some game, food, etc. he wanted and many times would embarrass me in the middle of a public setting like Wal-Mart. My parents sometimes too would help pay for his gas, and that got to the point where he would come to me to ask my parents for the money cause they didn\u2019t give it to him yet. I didn\u2019t want to give him money all the time and even tried calling him out in it, but he would always scream and yell, saying \u201chow dare I tell him not to take my money blah blah blah.\u201d \n\nHe generally became emotionally and financially abusive (I didn\u2019t know financial abuse was a thing until after we broke up), and the incident that made me really stop loving him was the night he raped me. He finally decided that waiting for me to be ready wasn\u2019t enough so he took it. We still dated almost a year after that but out of fear of what he would do if I left him. I finally left him the next year right before my birthday after finding out that he had cheated on me again with my (now ex) best friend. \n\nI wish I had said something sooner to my parents but only told them 3-4 years after it happened.

They said that the weirdest thing they saw was a woman lying face up in a tub and a man laying on top of her. When she took them apart, she knew why they were like that.\n\nGuy had domestic abuse problems and they were going through a separation. Kids in the other room, mom in the bathroom doing her hair.. the guy comes in and just stabs her several times, puts her in the tub and places the knife in her hands while he jumps on top of her and stabs himself either in the chest or abdomen and bleeds out.\n\nShe said she'll never forget how sad and unusual it was. Especially for those kids who thankfully were asleep. I think her mom found them... I hate thinking about it and I hope that family can heal. :(",
            "Hey! One I can answer! I cleanup suicides, decomps (where the person has been dead for days or weeks before being foind), and crime scenes. \n\nYou find the obvious stuff like sex toys, drug paraphernalia. One time I found a maybe fictional, maybe autobiographical journal of how this guy lost his testicles in an angle  grinder accident. This same guy had a small metal pipe (like a weed one hitter) along with some kind of dried fruit (like cherries or small plums) hidden in a box in his closet. It was like he was smoking it? Idk. We are pretty versed in the world of drugs and we couldn't figure that shit out.\n\nAs many first responders have already pointed out, the amount of brain and skull fragments left behind is alot bigger than what I would have imagined. Shit, they'll leave eyeballs behind. I've seen over half of an intact brain, a skull fragment big enough to use as a bowl, teeth. They get the biggest part of the body and roll out. They're not gonna spend an hour looking for all the giblets. That's why they pay us the big bucks.\n\nWhat's strange to me is that alot of adults go to their parents house to kill themselves. Kinda fucked up. Suicide season is not during the holidays. We are way more busy during spring than the end of the year.\n\nThe most eerie thing is how often we do suicides in rooms that just look normal. It's hard to explain, but it's just strange to go into a normal looking bedroom, with a half drank Gatorade on the dresser, a half read book on the night stand, and a big ole blood stain on the floor. \n\nAlso seeing the different ways the families cope with the tragedy. Our service is expensive yo, and there's been times I thought I was gonna get hit when I told them our estimated price. Especially if it's grandma or grandpa that swallowed a bullet and half the fucking family tree is at the house (I've done suicides as young as 12 and as old as 80's).\n\nYou get the people that are just on autopilot that ask weird questions cause they really aren't on the same plane of existence. We tear out all the carpet in a room if a gun is used. CSF is clear and is also a BBP carrier, so if it looks clean, it might still be contaminated. We've had the carpet pulled and removed and I've had family members ask, while they're looking at the slab concrete, if we are just gonna shampoo the carpet. \n\nYou get the people that seem almost happy that the person is gone. I've heard people say \"well now that (their kid) is gone, we can finally take that cruise!\" Idk if its just a coping mechanism or if they're just massive assholes. I try not to judge, key word: try.",
            "I've got a ton.\n\nI used to do CSI work and was an autopsy tech - so I would both go to the scene, investigate, bring the body back to the morgue, and help with the autopsy.\n\nAnyways, this person murdered their spouse, and stuffed the body into a fridge, and buried it in the woods. \n\nWhen you have a body exposed to the elements, you have \"normal\" decomposition to look forward to, such as insects, bloating/gases, skin coming off, bones showing, etc. Once you've seen a few, then you know that this kind of decomp/state of body is normal and you know what to expect. There are varying levels of stuff you deal with, but it's all within an expected spectrum of the job. Hope that makes sense.\n\nHowever, in this case, this person was sealed in - so you didn't have any of that. They were essentially stewing in there for almost a year (might've been longer, I don't remember the exact time). \n\nI wasn't there on scene when they found the person, only in the morgue, to help with the autopsy. So I prep the room, doctor comes in, and I pull out the body from the fridge and wheel them into where we do the actual autopsy. Opened the bag...\n\nAnd oh.my.GOD. The smell...I'll never, ever forget the smell. I've dealt with bodies in various stages of death and decomposition, but holy shit, this was on 10 other levels.\nNow the morgue has HVAC, air filters/freshners, and all that, but they weren't effective at all for the smell. It was so bad I gagged (which I've never done before) and almost threw up in my mask. The doctor was struggling too - the doc double backed and almost looked like they were gonna faint. It was the purest, worst, most concentrated, extremely pungent ammonia smell you could think of. I had never smelled anything like that in my career at that point. If wine ages well and is better with time, this ammonia smell did the exact opposite, and it was somewhere worse than anything you could think of. The smell stuck to us too, on our skin, for about a week no matter how hard I scrubbed. I can still smell it if I think about it. The texture of the body didn't help either...it was so slippery and wet that flecks of the ammonia-fluid splashed onto my skin (the long gloves went up to my forearm, not all the way to my scrubs). It was the worst autopsy of my life. It took about 3 hours because we kept having to take breaks and it was a difficult body to work on due to how fragile it was.\n\nIt beat out everything else I saw, from the crazy accident fatalities, the \"interesting\" suicides, to even the person who had half their face eaten by rats and half their body covered in a sea of maggots and insects.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the Gold!!\n\nAlso, RIP inbox (pun intended)\n\nEdit 2: HVAC, not HEPA",
            "I don't clean them for a living but had to clean a few apartments when my uncle managed an apartment complex.\n\nWe had one tenant OD on heroin. He sat there for roughly three weeks before anyone noticed the smell. They took his body and left it to us to clean up. The dude vomited on the CEILING. There were little dry droplets of vomit all over the ceiling right above where he died and to top it off he basically liquified and left a puddle of gut juices on the concrete foundation underneath the carpet.\n\nI thought that shit was left to a professional team, but I guess it's optional and if you don't want to pay for it, you can scoop the brains and blood up yourself?",

My and my coworker went into a house to clean a body but the boss failed to mention they had been dead for 2 weeks. Okay, whatever I can deal with that.\n\nWe walked to the house and not only could you smell it from the start of the driveway, but all the windows were black. Okay, this dude had blackout curtains I understand that. We suited up and went into the house, which was... Relatively clean given the circumstances. We knew he died in the bathroom so we made our way upstairs and followed the flies.\n\nSo... You know how flies swarm decaying things? Yeah it wasn't blackout curtains in the bathroom. The windows were caked in so many flies that sunlight couldn't come in. My boss also failed to mention he died in the bathtub. You hear about bloating and blah blah blah but do you know what happens when a body sits in a bathtub for 2 weeks and soaks up all that water? It explodes.\n\nThe entrails and remains of this... Soup was all over the taking, the walls, the door... It was everywhere. There was no water in the bathtub just this sickly pink colored stew. That was the most disgusting clean up I've done by far. I can't even imagine what it sounded like when that happened.\n\nEdit: I love reddit, someone reposted my story and got 600 upvotes and gold. Oh well. \ud83d\ude02",

I'll never forget needing to use pliers to pull teeth and skull fragments out of the drywall behind where he sat, or that blood and brain managed to make it's way more than 50 feet across the garage.\n\nMost disturbing though, was his pickup. We chose to take it to our company wash bay to pressure wash it and make sure it was as clean as possible. I cleaned it myself, and was satisfied that I had done well. Inspected for blood and couldn't find anything, so I began driving it back to the owner's garage. \n\nOn the way back a slight drizzle began and switched on the wiper blades. Imagine my horror as a chunk of brain streaks across my newly cleaned windshield! I pulled over quickly and cleaned it up, but it still makes me sick to think what would have happened if it didn't rain that day? This mans poor wife or daughter would have been met with that sight and been crushed again by the impact of suicide. That 10 years ago and I'll never forget it. Now I triple or quadruple check every job.",
            "Ok, not a crime scene cleaner but am a medic. Have a few bizarre ones.\n\nCame into a home to find a man who had attempted to commit suicide by putting a pistol under his jaw but failed/had a second thought. He ended up having to crawl 5ft away to where he had thrown the pistol after only blowing the left side of his face off to finish the job. The second one did the trick. Just about every surface in his living room had some remenenint of the poor guy. He left behind 2 kids. \n\nAnother time we had a husband who had caught his wife cheating and had turned on the garbage disposal and forced her arm down it. Massive hemorrhaging, but unfortunately she was D.O.A. Husband ended up with a self inflicted shotgun wound. PSA: People really don't understand just how messy a shotgun can make things. Think the hulk smashing a blood and brain filled pinata. \n\nAnd this one was more weird than anything but here goes: Older gentleman we were called to after police performed a wellness check late 70's. Nice house, nice foreign car in the driveway. Pictures of prayers and crosses all over the house. We had into the bedroom and there he is naked except for what I assume was one of those sexy nun Halloween costumes? Honestly I don't know but he ended up having a heart attack mid pleasure time while choking himself with a rosary. Definitely one of the weirdest things I ever saw during my time working the box."

When I got home from the hospital that day, I wanted to put myself in a better mood, so I watched Rush Hour, and then I watched Rush Hour 2, and then Rush Hour 3. Fast forward to a couple months ago, I volunteered at a high profile event that had a shit ton of celebrities. We weren\u2019t allowed to fraternize with the celebs and ask for pictures and autographs and stuff, but there was one celeb that I needed to slightly break that rule for. At the end of the event, I made sure to be near the exit and wait there for Detective James Carter himself. I approached him, I shook his hand and walked him out while explaining to him that Rush Hour got me through one of the worst days of my life so far and it made me smile during a time that I had no business smiling in. He stopped dead in his tracks, looked at me and thanked me for telling him. He then gave me a hug before sincerely wishing the best for me and leaving the event. And that\u2019s what happened when I met Chris Tucker. ",

            "This past summer me and 2 of my friends were passing the time by just walking in a creek (we\u2019re in high school so we had nothing better to do) as were walking we hear what we thought to be a little kid whining. The creek wound around an elementary school so we thought it might be some daycare going on. We continue to walk down the creek which then let us to a slow flowing river about waist deep. We swim down it having a good time when we hear the same sound of the kid again only it\u2019s sounds less than 5 meters away and it\u2019s definitely not a child. I look along the bank and spot a fawn (baby deer) stuck in some tree roots that were dangling over the bank.I don\u2019t know how long it had been stuck there but it\u2019s front left and both back legs were stuck in the roots. I ask one of my friends to hold my bag and I head over to the deer. It had to have been stuck there for a decent while because it didn\u2019t seem to struggle when I got close, presumably cause it was too tired to. I go over and lift the fawn up and carry him over to a less steep bank where he can make his way into the tree line surrounding the river. I don\u2019t know what happened to it after that but I\u2019m hoping it found it\u2019s mama. "

Currently at work so cant reply to everyone yet but I will go into more detail.\n\nResponse: sorry for the wait, i posted this on my way into work and didn't relies the response it would get. going through all the comments there is a lot more people qualified to answer then me but i can give you a regular basic answer:\n1. Stretching at first didn't help out to much, because i wasn't flexible so it felt useless until i started warming up before i stretched which is weird because i use to think you stretched to warm up.\n2. i have never done yoga but after reading the comments i might try it out.\n3. it took me 1 month to go from touching my knees and hurting to freely being able to touch my toes. but it only works if you stick with it and do it everyday, which is hard because it feels like you are getting nowhere but stick with it. \n4.  My \"Routine\" i did: reach for my toes and hold, fail, 10 jumping jacks, walk around for a break, repeat this 4 times every single day! note to try and push it a little bit but not to much because you can over stretch and make thing worse.\n5. It shouldn't take long to do, i never timed my stretching i just do it when i can, i lead a group of people on my site every morning for stretches, throughout the day i will reach for my toes, once i get home i do a little routine before i step into the shower. \n6. if you want to do a little more, 10 jumping jacks, 10 push up, 10 sit ups, do a bunch of small stretching, take a short break, repeat 4 times, it takes 20 min and i do this before i take a shower.\n7.

I let out one of those high pitched short laughs like is this girl for real? Oblivious to the tone of it she says \"I know right\" then asks me if I want it . I looked around thinking I was getting pranked or something cause this shit is too stereotypical to be real and I just assumed I was being filmed. She shook it at me and gave me a \"well?\" look. So I said fuck it and took the sandwich, she then pulled out her student ID card and bought a crap ton of french fries. That sandwich was awesome, I think the bread was homemade and it was stacked like a Dagwood. It had all kinds of expensive looking meats and Dijon mustard, serious gourmet shit. I know this girls mother will never see this but I just wanna say someone appreciated that sandwich.",

I was told to stay in the car and play on my gameboy (back when they were a thing lol). After an hour or so I got bored and I went to have a look at where my mum was with our puppy. The carpark was a little while from the training ground but I decided to walk towards her anyway.

If we went home and she put me to bed like the nurse suggested, I never would have woken up.\n\nEdit for detail: For those who keep asking/speculating it was Viral Meningitis (the less severe form) but it progressed very quickly. I had no headache when I arrived at school. By lunch time I couldn't move on my own and I couldn't see because light was too bright. The nurse came to get me and I didn't have a fever. After waiting for my mom 10 minutes and the 20 minute drive to the hospital and 10 minute wait at the hospital it was at 104.\nYes we told the nurse after, but there was only some of the symptoms when I left school.

So I remember my dad and my older brother getting out and going over the other cars and talking with the truck driver.

Client and his friend were smoking in a park, some citizen reports it to the police, and the cops come and find them in their car after smoking. My client admits to the cop that he was smoking. Obviously I'm thinking he's got no defense here. Other guy admits to smoking and gives the police the weed and pipe from his backpack. The entirety of the evidence was the admission and the physical evidence. So, I argue at trial (bench trial, no jury), with 0 expectation of winning, that the state failed to prove my client ever possessed the marijuana. \"Your honor, for all we know, the other guy at all times had possession of the marijuana. For all we know, he held the pipe to my clients lips and lit it for him.\" A discussion amongst myself, the judge, and the prosecutor ensues re: can you smoke marijuana and not be in possession of it?

            "I\u2019m a safety consultant for railroads, but railroads can fall under three governing bodies for regulations: FRA, OSHA, and MSHA. There were a lot of badly-needed regulations and updates coming to safety regs, some that were decades in the making (due to the initial research, NPRM, comment period, revisions, etc.)   \n  \nWhen Trump took office, one of his policies was that in order to pass one new reg, you had to remove two. So I\u2019ve seen a LOT of safety regulations go away, and a lot of pending safety regulations die. Industry in general is less safe now, although we won\u2019t see the big picture for a year or two until updated accident statistics come out.   \n  \nBut one that got killed was medical standards for locomotive crews. It\u2019s such a good idea that the railroads were literally petitioning FRA to pass a new regulation, and it died. What this means is there are only bare bones medical guidelines for who can run a train (lax hearing, vision, and color vision) but no rules about any other conditions. So you can have a guy running a 2-mile long train loaded with hazmats and he can be 400lbs, seizure prone, and have severe sleep apnea. If he loses consciousness, shit can get real bad.  \n  \n  \nAnd that happens - a lot. There have been 4-5 major derailments in the past five years with multiple fatalities and casualties, some in the NYC area, which were caused by undiagnosed sleep apnea. NTSB has been harping on FRA for a medical standards rule for years, and it was coming. And Trump killed it. ",

I really wanted to go but for some reason everyone else went except me and my cousin the same age. Before they left for the day the told us \u201cdon\u2019t go riding your bikes up and down the street, and don\u2019t go lighting fires\u201d. \n\nWell the first thing we do when they left is to go riding the bikes up and down the street. It was more like a steep road, and we would go to the top and coast down to see how fast we could get. Next thing was to take up some leaves and play with fire. \n\nAnyway they come home and somehow know about the riding the bikes from a neighbour and also notice the burnt leaves around the yard. We got marched inside and put through the usual interrogation and then my uncle decides we must be punished. He takes off his belt, leads my cousin into a bedroom and shortly after I hear three hard whacks, each followed by loud yelps of pain. \n\nMy cousin comes out, tears streaming down his face, and my uncle walks over and hands the belt to my Dad, who then leads me in to the bedroom. I\u2019m petrified. \n\nHe closes the door and looks at me. \u201cSon, I can\u2019t hit you with this\u201d he grins. \u201cJust lie on the bed, and I\u2019ll hit it beside you, and you yell out and pretend it hurts.\u201d\n\nSo that is what we did. And then I had to do my best impression of a crying, scolded boy when I left the room. My uncle gave Dad a look like \u201cgood job\u201d and we kept that secret for years.

Find something that you both like that isn't too involved and make a night of cooking (or preparing if you work and need more of a crock-or-instapot option) and eating with one another.

She showed up to her college classes everyday. She found a job working graveyard at a gas station just after 9/11 when racism was rampant and socially acceptable. She got hit by a van and that complicated showing up to work and when finances slipped, she was homeless for a time.\n\nBut she still found a way to survive and keep going to school and hold down a job. Because somewhere in her heart she knew that whatever situations she would get herself in as a newly minted adult would never be worse than the situation she had left behind.\n\nI'm 35 now and still dealing with depression on again and off again after plenty of therapy. Self care takes so much of my energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago I worked with a woman who was 84. She was an artist hired to do a project and had basically lived a life of great success (name withheld) and could take projects on selectively. We were talking about politics and then our lives. She too had up and left at a very young age to make a better life for herself.\n\nShe told me to remember that 18 year old young woman in my darkest moments. To hold onto her and never lose her because she has enough courage in her heart to get me through anything.\n\n \"Don't forget her,\" she said. \"You must never forget that part of you that is willing to fight for a better life.\"\n\n\n\n\nI will never forget this woman or her advice.\n\n\nEdit: awe, my first silver!!!

I'll remember that sound for the rest of my life, and the way she raced at me, grabbed my face in both of her hands, and wail-screamed, 'this wasn't your fault' before falling to pieces.\n\nIt's been six years. My family is closer than ever but none of us have recovered from the loss. Whenever things get overwhelming, I just think of that wail and realize that no matter how bad it gets, I will never be the one to CAUSE that sound.\n\nEdit: I came back to so much love and so many heartbreaking and heartwarming messages of solidarity and kindness and empathy and I cannot thank you all enough for not only sharing your stories. Thank you all so much.\n\nAnd, as there was talk of it, the tl;dr of the story was that my sister was troubled. We were closer than she'd been to anyone, but she found a guy she really liked and  she got into drugs and wound up stealing percocet from me after a surgery I'd had. She was subsequently kicked out of the house because I pushed for it (She was 21, and she'd drained my parents of over 10k over the course of a year; they didn't know about the drugs until I told them) and she left to find her way with her drug-dealer boyfriend in Alberta.\n\nShe got sick out there. I refused to talk to her; I felt betrayed. You always feel like you'll have more time. But within 3 months she fell asleep at the wheel of a car and met a van head-on. I know, logically, that it's not my fault, but my mother knew how I felt responsible for the fallout.\n\nFour years of therapy, and we're all doing much better than we were.

One night for some reason someone decided that they needed to put hands on him and pray for his soul.  He didn't like that so he jumped back and yelled profanities at them.  That apparently was clear evidence that he was possessed so several adults wrestled him out of the pew and held him down while he screamed and flailed and cussed at them for the next couple of HOURS until he was exhausted and bruised enough and they were satisfied the demon left. The hundred or so onlookers just all started praying and crying and dancing around it.\n\nThat was just a pretty normal church night, maybe a little more spirited than usual.  He didn't return and in retrospect its amazing that the police never even showed up.

Then she told me a story about how one of her mom's boyfriends showed her his penis when she was about 6 and tried to get her to touch it.

To me, that\u2019s horrible to put your kids in predicaments such as those, and this went on my entire childhood. I mean, he had addicts with kids living in our house at times. It\u2019s surreal to think about as an adult. \n\nThat being said, I never looked at my childhood as a horrible one. It was all I knew.

From the street you'd think it was abandoned. Overgrown yard, part of the roof caved in, boarded up windows. Inside, it was all antiques, and furniture from the 30's and 40's, slowly deteriorating, and it looked as though they hadn't  dusted in years. Wallpaper pealing, old portraits half fallen. Looking up to the second floor from the stairs, just cobwebs and collapsed ceilings. They said they hadn't been up their in years. And definitely rat noises. They both looked and lived like ghosts, and seemed half mad, very civil and proper but off. As an 8 year old, I was terrified, especially when one of them joked and said \"You should leave him here. He can live with us\".  I burst into tears, and we left.\n\n&#x200B;",

We wandered away from the guide just to explore a bit and we were approached by a young girl (15-16) carrying what looked to be a sleeping toddler; she asked us to buy milk for her baby and we obliged because hey, babies need food.\n\nJust as we were about to walk into the store our guide spots us and tells us to get in his car (we used it for transportation to and from a bunch of temples); the girl then starts screaming profanities at us and the guide and we pile into our car. She started banging on the windows of the car (while still screaming) after the door was closed, and surprisingly enough the toddler still didn't wake up. We asked our guide wtf just happened and he relayed this to us: \n\nApparently in Cambodia (and some other countries), gangs will profit off of not only sex trafficking from children but also a form of \"pity\" trafficking. They will take a small child (toddler) and drug them so they look as though they're sleeping; they'll pass the child off to a young girl who will beg for food/money/etc and pose as the toddlers mother. Then, she'll pass the child off to a new girl who will repeat the act. They do this until the child wakes up, will feed them, and then start the process again. \n\nAs the toddlers get older they'll be taught to try and sell things to tourists; if they fail to meet a quota they'll sometimes lose limbs (fingers, hands, arms, legs) and will then run a story about how they \"stepped on an old landmine.\" This is actually somewhat possible as the country is still reeling from the impact Pol Pot had and there *are* still unearthed landmines, but the issue is that <1% are close to the main city/Angor Wat which is where a majority of these children were.\n\nWe were shocked to say the least; this seemed kind of far fetched but What else would we believe? We did some research online and found stuff about the sex trafficking but not much about the toddler swapping and child mutilation. When we went into town the next day (with our guide) what did we see? The same toddler being passed to a different girl, still knocked out, still in the same clothing. \n\nDefinitely creepy. I loved Angkor Wat and thought it was beautiful, but I don't plan on going back there any time soon. ",

He could do things like brush his teeth, dress himself, etc. but needed prompting & supervision. My gma, his mother, died in 1974. My uncle died in 1984. The night before he died he told all of us that \"mama came to see me last night.\" My Dad asked him if he had a dream about mama. He said \"no! She sat on my bed with me & told me she was coming to get me soon & take me home with her & not to be scared because it was all ok.\" We dismissed it. 24 hours later he was dead. He died peacefully in his sleep.\n\nThanks for the award. I'm new so I don't know what it means yet but aww.",

I very much appreciate it!",

The last thing he did was put his hand on my shoulder and said, \"No wonder you never liked my spicy food.\" and then he passed about ten seconds later. We were all super confused. About three months later I almost died from suffocation after eating some salsa. At the hospital I was diagnosed with a capsaicin allergy (Spicy food). To this day it still creeps me out.

We're right here with you; it's ok to leave.\"  The patient immediately calmed, put her head back on the pillow and died.\n\nI knew I wanted to be that nurse when I grew up.

His wife, who had been given a few months to prepare herself, was calm and focused on her husband. I had to routinely check his level of consciousness which involved talking to him in a loud voice (responds to auditory stimulation), which I did not like to do. So I asked his wife to do the loud voice part, so the voice he would hear would be hers not mine, and she did so without hesitation. The only response we observed with. her vocalization was that this by now profoundly unconscious patient took her hand to his lips and kissed it. He stopped breathing very soon after that.

In his 60s. Did yoga every day, walked a few miles 5 days a week. Genuinely nice guy which is always a bad prognostic sign.\n\nWith his heart failure, his heart was so stretched out and not squeezing adequately to provide the blood and subsequent oxygen he needs to the rest of his body. A few nights into his hospital stay, I come in the next morning and discovered that the senior resident had to code him for sustained unstable heart arrhythmia ( unstable v tach). I went and talked with him about it the next morning and he told me that he was in and out of consciousness during it all (from the low blood pressure) but he compared it to the feeling of jumping out of the plane and sky diving.\n\nLater that morning I was checking on him again and he didn't look so good. He goes into the arrhythmia again, drops his blood pressure, and is in and out of consciousness. As I'm charging the defibrillator to shock him again, he comes back around to and briefly and asks me if I'm taking him sky diving again and let's out a nervous laugh before losing consciousness."

She'd been born *really* underweight, suffered from bad joints, fibromyalgia, an inverted uterus and a host of other issues. Sex was kinda complicated but she was fun and attractive and we made it work.\n\nShe also lost her right eye due to an infection when she was a child, leaving her partially sighted with a glass eye. Once, while we were getting into it doggy-style, on one particularly vigorous... thrust... from me, said glass eye flew out of her eye, hitting the headboard with an audible *ting*.

            "I dated a girl back in the early 2000s who lost a leg in a car accident. She was aggressively sexual to a fault. I'm not sure nympho is the right term for her. I think it was more that she used sex as a way to cope with her anger about the situation. \n\nBecause her leg was removed near her hip it was easier to perform missionary than other positions, so that was typically how we had sex. It was easier for me because I could maneuver more without her leg getting in the way. Some people might say that is a shitty thing to say, but I think she would tell you that it made the sex better. Which it definitely did. \n\nShe was a cool girl and I really liked her, but she had a lot of emotional issues and pent-up anger that I was never really able to come to terms with and after a while I got tired of being the punching bag she would take her anger out on when she was having a bad day. I never blamed her. She was a professional dancer before losing her leg and it killed her career. She never recovered that part of herself and I could tell it destroyed her. I wanted to be that person for her. You know, support her, but her anger just pushed me away. \n\nThe sex was crazy good, maybe some of the best sex I have ever had, but that just isn't enough to sustain a relationship. People ask me if I was ever weirded out by it, or had issues with her missing leg. Honestly, no. After a while, it was just a normal everyday thing. I cared about her. I still think about her sometimes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "My husband is an amputee. Ied 10 years ago. Lost the leg, along with nerve damage. The nerve damage causes some impotence. Nothing serious, just some times we have to call it early (or not at all). Once he realized that I wasn\u2019t judging him for it, back when we were dating, it got better. He had a lot of nervousness about it, which makes it worse. But it usually just takes a little extra effort on my part to get him ready. \n\nPart of that is also that he is very giving. If he feels like I\u2019m not into it, it happens. It\u2019s just who he is, and he\u2019s a wonderful person. I couldn\u2019t ask for a better SO. \n\nAs far as the missing leg. He\u2019s a below the knee amputee, and wears a prosthetic. But they\u2019ve been trying to fix the nerve damage for years, and he has good and bad days. He can\u2019t stand during sex for long. The rest is about the same, physically. \n\nReally the worst part is when he really wants to, but can\u2019t. Personally, yeah it can get frustrating. But more the situation, and how he\u2019s feeling. For the most part we have a wonderful sex life. "

I am loving all of the success stories from people who have formed a positive relationship with exercise. For the few who have opted to claim that walking is not exercise, please do some research before you argue with science. Do a google scholar search for \u201cwalking benefits\u201d and you will see hundreds of medical studies listing the benefits than can come from as little as 5 miles/week at a 2 mph pace. These include lower risk of premature death, improved cardiac risk factors such as cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, vascular stiffness and inflammation, and mental stress. In addition, walking offers protective benefits against other chronic disease. \n\nWalking is considered a \u201cmoderate\u201d physical activity. There is a linear relationship between workout intensity and health outcomes, so higher intensity activities do offer greater protection against disease. However, walking is a wonderful, beneficial option for those who enjoy it or do not wish to engage in a more strenuous form of exercise. ",

My teacher was one of the \u201ccool\u201d ones- the kind who act laid back and crack jokes and all that. \n\nI think this guy just thought I wasn\u2019t trying, and he was as frustrated with me as I was with myself. One day in class he made a sort of passive aggressive joke at my expense- something about \u201cif you would just try harder\u201d. He didn\u2019t even say it in front of other students, just to me, but I was so over him thinking I wasn\u2019t trying that I got up and walked straight out and to the school counsellor\u2019s office. I would have been sent there anyway for walking out in class, so I decided to expedite the process. She was really kind and talked me down from being so upset.\n\nAnyway, that was on a Friday, so I didn\u2019t see my Calculus teacher again until Monday. I was hoping we could just pretend it didn\u2019t happen, but no such luck. He pulled me into the hallway to talk... and truly, genuinely apologized. He offered to adjust his office hours (which didn\u2019t work for me) to give me extra help. He ended up helping me pass the class- barely, but I still passed. I wouldn\u2019t have graduated without it. In retrospect just talking to him more openly from the get go probably would have been the more mature thing to do, but I was an awkward, self-doubting teenager who didn\u2019t know how to ask for help. In the end the experience helped me improve that skill and advocate for myself.\n\nI still hate calculus though.",

We had several class periods over the course of those months as well to work on it. My project was creating an unbeatable tic-tac-toe program (did work properly but that's beside the point right now). Because it would take significantly longer to have 20 people (the amount of tests we had to do) each play 3 rounds with the thing so I asked her if I could do fewer and she agreed, allowing me to only do 7 people which I got done shortly before christmas break, only about 1 and a half school weeks until the project was due. I make sure to thank her for letting me do fewer as I would never have gotten it done in time otherwise. She turns to me with this confused look as says something to the effect of \"I never said that, you have to do 20 trials like everyone else\". \n\nI was so insanely furious, I even got a witness who had overheard her give me a lower number come in as evidence. Both me and my witness ended up in detention. I did end up getting the project done but barely and it was rushed as hell. I still occasionally thing of it and want to punch a wall.\n\nEdit: apparently I had a typo, I had meant to type \"didn't work properly\" but the way it came out, not only do I sound like a humblebrag but I also started an argument later down the comment chain... oop.",

I mainly had cramps that were so bad I couldn't do anything useful anymore except curl up and wait for them to be over. It took me more than a month to figure out a very limited amount of safe stuff to eat, which I ended up slowly expanding on over time. I did miss a few weeks of school when it first started though. \n\nDirectly after my math teacher's class she insisted I come to her and explain why I missed so many of her classes. I had a note from my gp ready, but she dismissed it. She told me she could tell that I wasn't sick, but that I was just lazy and lying to everyone and that she was severely disappointed in me. I literally just walked away, which is the closest I ever got to having a temper tantrum in class. In retrospect I wish I had told her what I was really thinking, being that I was very disappointed in her.  \n\nEdit: typos and such. "

He genuinely wanted help, that's why he stuck around, and we were there to listen and help him through the shakes, hallucinations, and other symptoms. \n\nHe was slamming his fists on the desk at this point, and he had started just yelling \"I just want some fucking ice!\" (Slang for crystal meth) Well, the tech with me was inexperienced, although much older than me, and while I talked to him and tried to calm him down, she went back to our staff kitchen and got him a glass of ice. Like, frozen water. She brought it out to him and put it in his hand like, Problem Solved!, and the guys just froze with confusion, staring at it.

They began writing works of fiction but later turned to crime.\n\n> According to Wallace, the girls had a longstanding agreement that if one died, the other must begin to speak and live a normal life. During their stay in the hospital, they began to believe that it was necessary for one of them to die, and after much discussion, Jennifer agreed to make the sacrifice of her life. In March 1993, the twins were transferred from Broadmoor to the more open Caswell Clinic in Bridgend, Wales. On arrival Jennifer could not be roused. She was taken to the hospital where she died soon after of acute myocarditis, a sudden inflammation of the heart. There was no evidence of drugs or poison in her system, and her death remains a mystery. At the inquest, June revealed that Jennifer had been acting strangely for about a day before their release; her speech had been slurring, and she had said that she was dying.

I had about 15ish hours done and getting close to soloing for the first time but still had a few hours and more landings to practice. I was doing some basics and getting ready to come back with my instructor to practice some touch and go's for a bit. Coming back through we had to pass through DTW's bravo airspace (means need permission to go through it). A few min before I was about to call for permission, my instructor got really quiet. I looked over at him and he looked really bad. I thought he was going to puke so looking for a bag. But then I notice he isn't breathing. I figure out where I am at and call up DTW approach. Declare a medical emergency and that my instructor was not breathing. I also told them I am a student and never landed on my own before, and never in a large airport. Detroit approach was amazing at helping me. They gave me an option for DTW or Willow but Willow would have added a good 5-10 min since i was coming in from the SE. Opted for DTW and they were great at giving me vectors while also getting the big jets out of the way. I remember hearing them tell several planes to go around and several more into a hold. Anyway, did my approach and made the most butter smooth landing I have ever made in my life (even till this day). Ambulance was right there on the taxi waiting for me. Turns out my instructor who was only 25 had a heart attack. He ended up being ok. All in all from first call to him in the ambulance was less than 10 min thanks to ATC and DTW tower. \n\nEdit: Thank you so much kind strangers for the gold and silver, it's my first for both! ",

Before I took off, the CFO of the flight school asked me if \"I was sure it was a good idea to fly, it's pretty windy\". I was flying a cessna 152 on a day with wind pushing 15 kts and turbulence around 20. I honestly don't know what I or anyone at the flightschool was thinking letting me (16 years old) take off.\n\nAnyways, a few bumpy circuits go by with no problem. I actually got some great practice landing in turbulence. So the last circuit of the day, I'm on final with full flaps doing the ABSOLUTE minimum speed for approach in a 152, not taking into consideration that the air is super turbulent. For those who don't know, when it's bumpy you should be going a little faster on approach than usual. Anyways I'm quite close to the ground, maybe 300-400 feet and I can HEAR the wind blowing over the sound of the engine.\n\nSuddenly, no wind.\n\nI had just lost 15-20kts of almost direct headwind on final approach with absolutely no airspeed to spare.\n\nI remember my shirt sleeves looked like they were inflating and the plane's stall warning started screaming at me. The controls became totally useless, like a limp computer joystick. Thankfully I had my hand on the throttle like my instructor taught me and for whatever instinctual reason (good instructor probably), I gently pushed the throttle all the way and slightly lowered the nose.\n\nAll of this took place in the span of about 5 seconds. I remember what I did, but not thinking about doing it. It was like when you drive somewhere and you suddenly realize you've arrived without remembering driving.\n\nDamn scary.\n\nAnyways I landed the plane just fine and went home and took a nap. My parents said I was pale as a ghost when I got home.\n\nFlying is fun until it isn't.\n\nEDIT 1: Thanks for GOLD! My first!\n\nEdit 2:\n\nA lot of people are wondering why I \"gently\" pushed the throttle in. The reason is because the carburetor can't provide enough fuel to maintain the proper fuel/air mixture. When the pilot rapidly pushes the throttle in, the carb is supposed to provide a quick \"squirt\" of fuel to account for the rapid increase in air. If the pilot *slams the throttle to the firewall*, the huge amount of air coming into the carb is simply too much for it to maintain the proper air/fuel mixture, even with the extra \"squirt\". In the best case this can cause the engine to \"lag\" for a few seconds while the mixture catches up, and in the worst case might actually cause the engine to stall completely.\n\nSo imagine an inexperienced pilot who panics and really jams the throttle all the way. That may have a disastrous effect because not only are they at low altitude with little airspeed, but they just choked their engine and simply can't get more power.",

Probably the closest moment to \"we're fucked\" I ever had was a few years ago. \n\nTo set it up, I was ferrying a helicopter by myself to another location about 200 miles away.  The helicopter I was flying was set up for IFR (instrument flying), and I'm a fairly experienced IFR captain.  The helicopter I was in does NOT like ice.  That means that flying in the clouds when it's below freezing is basically impossible.  This was in the high arctic, in the early spring.  So basically always cold.\n\nWeather wasn't great, but I still wanted to give the trip a shot.  If it was bad, I would just turn around and come home. About 50 miles out, the cloud ceiling was coming down, and visibility was dropping.  I was over a small frozen lake, and I could see at the other end of the lake that the clouds were right to the ground.  At this point I'm at about 300 feet above ground.  \n\nI make the call to turn around, and start a left-hand turn, but as I'm half-way through the turn I enter cloud.  Under normal circumstances, a VFR helicopter unintentionally entering cloud is often a death sentence, but I'm a trained IFR pilot in an IFR helicopter.  I start a climb, as I know there is rising terrain on the side of the lake. \n\nI don't mind flying in cloud.  What I do mind is the fact that my helicopter starts icing up instantly.  I'm not talking about a bit of ice, I'm talking about a MASSIVE amount of ice, in a helicopter that doesn't like any ice.  There is no way I can make it the 50 miles back to the airport to shoot an IFR approach, and I know the clouds are too thick to climb above them.  I also can't descend because the ceiling is so low that I risk impacting the terrain if I don't pop out of the cloud soon enough.\n\nI'm running through the options in my head, but my heart rate is going up.  This isn't something that normally happens.  I'm not the type of pilot that gets into situations that scare me.  I'm rapidly running out of time, so I head to a larger flat-area (as indicated on my GPS and maps), set my radio-altimeter (a device that tells you exactly how far above the ground you are) to beep at me when I reach 250 feet, and start descending.  I figure if I don't break out by 300 feet, I'm in some serious trouble.\n\nAs I'm approaching 300 feet, I break out of cloud.  Good visibility, and a clear path all the way back to the airport. I do a normal approach and landing, and shut-down at our hangar.  The blades are covered in ice.  After I change my underwear, we pull the helicopter into the hangar to let the ice thaw.  The next day, the weather is beautiful, and the trip goes off without a hitch.\n\nAfter flying for 10 years and thousands of hours, it was the only time I was actually scared.  I'm glad I didn't have any passengers on board at the time."

            "I come from a family of doctors, I am a doctor, and I grew up knowing basically every doctor in my area. The best story I got is about a doctor we will call \"Graybow,\" perhaps one of the most senior and respected internal medicine doctors in my area.\n\nMy dad is a workaholic. He loves medicine more than anything and if he could do anything, it would likely be spending more time in the hospital. Me? Not so much... Dad and Dr Graybow were very similar in how much they love their work. Dad and Graybow over the years became good friends and had a sort of direct and cynical humor they shared with each other.\n\nAt one point, my dad cracked a joke at Graybow because he again showed up to work even though he was a bit sick. Dad asked:\n\n> Hey Gray, when do you think you are going to retire? You are getting pretty old and we don't want to have to pick you up off the floor here at some point.\n\nGraybow replied:\n\n> I'll never retire. Wait. Yeah, I will... **when I die.**\n\nGraybow never retired.\n\nA few years later, he was driving back home from an outing with his middle-aged son and he started having a heart attack. While I assume he was experiencing the severe and horrible pain of a heart attack, he just looked over at his son and said:\n\n> I am sorry, I am having a heart attack.\n\n... he passed away after pulling over. The man apologized to his son for having a heart attack that he was completely aware of. I can't say I would have handled that like he did.",

            "The saying \u201cdoctors make the worst patients\u201d is true for a reason. Most of the doctors I work with (myself included) wouldn\u2019t hesitate to diagnose ourselves, and have on many occasions. Obviously this comes with some bias, but I like to think that I\u2019m able to tell the difference between: A. This isn\u2019t serious I can deal, vs B. Maybe it\u2019s time to get a real work up\n\nOn that note, I have a particular anecdote:\nMy attending (lead doctor while I\u2019m in residency) recently had an emergency appendectomy. He has a history of kidney stones, and assumed that acute right lower quadrant pain was another one. By the time he realized maybe this is a situation \u201cB\u201d, his appendix had become gangrenous\n\n\nEdit: Holy crap this blew up overnight. Got a busy day but I\u2019ll try and respond to a lot of the questions as the day goes on. \n\nFigured I\u2019d clarify a couple things that were touched on in other posts:\n\n1. My attending is just fine. Got his appendix removed and was back at work the next week. \n\n2. The whole self diagnosis thing only goes so far. Really depends on the severity of your issue and how much work up is required. For instance: if it\u2019s a suspected muscle strain or something, I\u2019ll easily diagnose myself and do appropriate stretches. If I\u2019m a little unsure, maybe ask a colleague for a informal second opinion. Because it\u2019s not that serious and requires minimal work up (essentially a diagnosis made by exam) this is no issue. HOWEVER, if let\u2019s say \u201cI think this might be more serious, I think I need a CT scan\u201d or something, you can\u2019t just do that on your own. You need to actually book yourself an appointment and get formal when up. Those scans aren\u2019t cheap and you can\u2019t just sneak your way in. Plus, I wouldn\u2019t trust myself to read the images!\n\n3. If I\u2019m confident I have a mild infection (let\u2019s say for example pink eye) I wouldn\u2019t necessarily go to the clinic and waste an afternoon/money, but would just ask a colleague for a prescription for the appropriate eye drops \n\n4. You technically CAN write prescriptions for your family, but it can be frowned upon and seen as suspicious depending what it is (ex: an antibiotic vs large amounts of oxy). It is pretty difficult to write a script for yourself though. \n\n5. Another anecdote: In college I had significant anxiety. My dad, a radiologist (reads xrays, CT\u2019s, etc), not knowing anything about psych issues, wrote me a long-standing Rx for Lorazepam (a benzo like Xanax). This was not the right thing, but I didn\u2019t know better. It was essentially a band aid that didn\u2019t attack the problem at the source (not to mention studies have since come out saying daily benzo use can contribute to end of life dementia). I didn\u2019t REALLY tackle my problem until I started seeing a psychiatrist and got on an SSRI instead. This is an example of how it can bite you in the ass. \n\n6. LAST ANECDOTE: I have what is called a lipoma on my abdomen. A benign, painless fat cell tumor that is, for me, the size of a quarter (some can get massive!). Really just unaesthetic, but not harmful. Instead of formal, paid work up, I went to my mom (who is an ultrasound tech) to get a free scan. Then I brought the image to my dad (a radiologist) who interpreted it as just a lipoma, nothing to worry about. So I did get a formal work up, but not through formal channels. And now I\u2019m happy living with my lipoma care free! (I named him Stevie)\n\nIf you guys have any other questions I\u2019m more than happy to answer! AMA I guess!"

            "I saw a therapist who used Cognitive Behavior Therapy to treat depression.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just \u201ctalking it out,\u201d (though there was some of that), more importantly they taught me how to recognize what specific negative thoughts are behind negative emotions, and dig down even deeper to identify the negative self-beliefs behind those thoughts. Then, to be able to recognize in the moment when I\u2019n having have negative thoughts, evaluate how accurate they are, and reframe them in a more accurate, positive light, to prevent a downward spiral of rumination and negative self-talk.\n\nIt was basically like going to see a personal trainer, but for my mind. Specific exercises, homework, etc. And it really was like exercise. The more you engage in certain thought patterns,  the more your brain learns to engage in those patterns, and the easier it gets (this is true both positively and negatively). At first I really had to pay attention to what was going on in my head, and try really hard to reframe things more positively, but it got easier and more automatic as time went on.\n\nObviously, talking about your problems with people close to you is important, and therapy wasn't a replacement for that. But I also don't think just talking to my friends and family would have helped me with the deeper issues at all, or even realize what the deeper issues were.",
            "My dads a shrink so this answer may be a bit biased:\n\nI would say just talking to pals is a bit like using Webmd instead of going to a doctor, you might get the right answers and some peace of mind, but the actual nuances of what you are dealing with will likely be lost without the eye of a professional. And sometimes those nuances are the difference between getting useful advice and destructive advice.",
            "They are paid to listen to me. I don't have to worry about if I'm bothering them (I am paying them, I am decidedly not bothering them they have nothing else to do at that moment), if its a good time for them to hear about my problem (its my appointment! of course its a good time!), or that I need to ask them about them and their lives and check-in on them. It's SUPPOSED to be one-sided. What a blessing and a huge weight off my back. So all the politeness in my life gets to be shed and I get to just be sad, and angry, and irrational without worrying I'm burdening a friend and without worrying what my friend thinks about me now. It is guiltless and freeing.\n\nAnd there's something great about telling a completely neutral third party about shit. Since they don't care about how our friendship is going to be if they say real shit, they'll say it. Also since we're not friends my therapist can see beyond the bullshit and look into my stuff with fresh eyes. \n\nAnd like others have said she provides pointed questions, connecting things I never thought about, and exercises/books to read to help me more. \n\nIt's like any other doctor. Sure you can go to your friend if you have a small cut and they can help you out with a first-aid kit, but if your arm is on the edge of being severed if you don't get immediate attention why would you go to a friend or family member? You'd go to a freaking doctor who has training. Yeah the friend/family member might be able to help out a bit but that's an unfair burden to put on them! \n\nI resisted therapy for a long time because I had bad experiences. If your wife does go (which she should! everyone should!) remind her it's okayy if the first one she goes to sucks and she can find a different one. Just like people shop around for doctors they like or find a specialist for them, you do the same with a therapist. I am SO happy i went, I was at my wit's end and had talked to so many people about my mental health problems and I reached a dead end. Therapy was absolutely incredible. I no longer have flash backs to my assaults, I don't break down in anxiety attacks anymore, my depression flare-ups are fewer and further in-between!",
            "My therapist knows the questions to ask to direct my thoughts in a productive direction. She gives me homework - exercises to practice tracking my feelings back to the thoughts that generated them, for example. She knows how to keep my thoughts focused on progress, instead of letting me wander off in some random direction.\n\nThere's a helluva lot more to therapy than just 'talking it out'.\n\nEdit: I changed \"right direction\" to \"productive direction\" - didn't realise the unwanted implications of there being a right or wrong way to think, my apologies.",
            "Therapists are better at knowing what you really need long term and not just what will make you feel better for the rest of the day.\n\nFor example, when I started with my therapist I really needed someone to make me upset so that I'd be forced to work through my experiences.  I'm bad at talking about terrible shit.  I'll make jokes, change subject, literally anything so long as I don't have to get anywhere near the root event.\n\nBut my therapist wouldn't let me.  If I joked or changed subject, she just kept going undeterred until I was crying and pissed. Then she helped me climb back out of the hole in a healthy way.  Nobody who loves me could have done that.  They'd have backed out when I started getting upset instead of continuing to push.\n\nPlus they're not as biased.  They won't agree with you just because they like you.  If you say something totally wild, they'll call you out.\n\nOther people may need other things from therapists, but I need someone to call out my flaws and force me to confront things I avoid.",

            "Lots of little differences, like therapists are usually better at being objective & helping you see what actions are rational vs. irrational, they\u2019re trained in active listening and don\u2019t talk over you or redirect focus to them, comfortable with outburts of emotion and don\u2019t shy away from tears, can give you homework based on years of training, etc.\n\nBiggest difference though? The knowledge that this person is a professional and that your emotional problems are not a burden to them. The ability to fully express your emotions, without qualifiers like \u201cbut it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll figure it out\u201d or \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to worry about, I\u2019m handling it\u201d etc. The feeling of relief when someone else shares the weight of your grief without it draining them or causing them pain.\n\nTherapy isn\u2019t just beneficial to you. It\u2019s beneficial to everyone who loves you.\n\n**Edit to add in response to some frequent comments I'm seeing:**\n\n**How do you afford it?** A lot of therapists offer sliding scale fees, I've seen them go as low as $30 dollars a session. If you're really struggling still to find somewhere inexpensive search local unis/colleges + therapy or psychology clinic and you might be able to find cheaper therapists who are still in training. Still can't find anything? Consider non-psychologist therapists and counselors. Look up reviews before picking them though.\n\n**Great answer, but my therapist isn't like that and it sucks.** Stop seeing them. Find someone else who provides the therapy style that works best for you. I went through 13 therapists/psychologists/counselors in a year before settling on one. Yes, it was draining, but I'm glad I did it. I wouldn't have improved if I hadn't found someone who could match my emotional needs (for me that was finding someone blunt, funny, and willing to fully call me on my shit).\n\n**Them being paid is what makes me not trust them. I don't want to talk to someone who doesn't care and is just in it for the money.** Therapists care. Or at least, the vast majority do. They wouldn't have survived through schooling and placement and years of work if they couldn't empathize with their clients. Many therapists actually have their own therapists, because they care deeply about their clients and need a space to express that healthily. I honestly used to have the same attitude, that it wasn't worth paying for someone to care about me. But you know what's worse than paying someone to listen to you unload all your problems? *Not paying someone to listen to you unload all your problems.* Your friends and family are **not equipped** to deal with the entirety of your problems as well as their own. They want to do it anyway, but it can take a huge toll on their own mental health and put immense strain on your relationship with them. And if you're just bottling everything up instead of talking to anyone, that's also putting a strain on your relationships and it will crush your friends and family if you wind up having a breakdown as a result of not talking.\n\n**I just can't trust people enough to go to therapy.** Coming from the queen of trust issues (hello to my childhood trauma), I get it. I like therapy, because at the end of the day there's not much I'm risking by trusting this person. I tell them my secrets, sure, but if I wanted to I could cancel my next session and never see them again. I let them in, but if I want to I can tell them I'm not interested in discussing xyz, and if they push it I can go find someone else. Therapy is a safe environment where I can learn that it's okay to express what I'm feeling, and I can take what I've learned there and slowly apply it in my daily life.\n\nTherapy can be hard. It can be scary. It can be work. But it can also make an immense difference in both your life and the lives of your loved ones. It can provide you with the tools to shoulder your burdens *healthily*. It can help you discover things about yourself you didn't even know were still fucking you up years later. It's worth a shot, at the very least."

            "A lot of ones from the rise of Caesar Augustus/Octavian.\n\n-Cleoptra was a slut who became powerful only by sex appeal. Contemporary and unbiased sources actually suggest she was rather plain, but it was her intellect and charming conversation that got her power. Also, as far as sexual relations go, her affairs with Julius Caesar and Antony, as well as her traditional marriages to her brothers, aren\u2019t bad compared to the well-known affairs of some other figures, especially Antony. Defaming Cleopatra made her easier to demonize and portray as a seductress ruling over Antony, making war easier for Octavian. \n\n-Marcus Lepidus was useless. In reality, though he lacked the clout or force of personality that Octavian and Antony wielded, he was a competent administrator and leader who played a key role in defeating Sextus Pompey. He was a big enough political threat that both Antony and Octavian wanted him gone, but couldn\u2019t just kill him (he was forced into joining the priesthood as a solution). Octavian would rather just have people forget that he wasn\u2019t the only \u201ctrue\u201d Roman option (Antony being, semi-fairly, perceived as far too decadent).\n\n-Sextus Pompey was a barbaric pirate king who raped and plundered the Mediterranean. The youngest son of Pompey Magnus was likely a competent ruler, given that he held Sicily and Sardinia against the Triumvirate with no internal attempts to unseat him. He did blockade the city of Rome from its grain supply to force the triumvirs to negotiate with him, but the characterization of him as a monster is unfair.\n\n-Octavian being a great military leader. All evidence points to the contrary: three great victories often are attributed to him, and we shall examine them. At Mutina, where pro-Senate forces fought Mark Antony in the chaos after Caesar\u2019s death, Octavian was a general, but was subordinate to two other men who did much of the real leadership. These two were killed in battle, however, so Octavian gets the credit. At Philippi, where Brutus and Cassius were defeated by Antony and Octavian, Octavian\u2019s forces were overrun by Brutus\u2019 while, a little ways away, Antony destroyed Cassius\u2019 army. When Octavian\u2019s camp was overrun, he was found to not even be present; he had claimed illness the night before and stayed away from the battle. Antony had to bring his own troops around to defeat Brutus. And finally, Actium, where Antony and Cleopatra were defeated not by Octavian, but his more capable subordinate, Marcus Agrippa. Agrippa was known for his engineering and architectural skill, but was also a valuable commander (he was the man who defeated Sextus Pompey at sea while Lepidus took his territory by land). Agrippa organized the fleet at Actium and was the one to lead them to victory.\n\nA lot of this was instilled by Augustus\u2019 rather successful record destroying once he became ruler and no one having enough power to challenge him.",

My job that was a M-F, 9-5, somehow turned into on call all the time. \nMy workload was always heavy, got added onto. I would say no to additional workload. It somehow still ended up on my plate. \nSomewhere around a year after the ownership change, I found myself googling heart attack, and mental breakdown symptoms because I knew something wasnt right. \nI finally walked into work one day and handed in my notice. No job lined up. Didnt think it through. I wrote up my notice 5min before I left for work that day.\nDue to bills, I ended up taking a job I was overqualified for, and made crap for pay. But after a few months I got hired to where I am now. I do the same type of job as the one I walked away from. \nDid it work out for me, I'd like to say yes. But  only time will tell.

            "Yes! I quit a very high-paying job, in fact. I was a software engineer. \n\nIt was great at first. I liked my coworkers, and the company was one of those startups that had a ping pong table and coldbrew coffee on tap and all that jazz. It was my first job out of college and I was dazzled by the cool community feel and all the \u201camenities.\u201d\n\nHowever, they had no system in place to train me. I was basically expected to just read the codebase and just instantly know exactly what to do. My team leader couldn\u2019t answer my questions, and I quickly started drowning in work. \n\nMy once-recreational drug use turned habitual. I was railing lines of coke in the bathroom to stay awake because I stayed until 9pm trying to finish projects by the deadline and doing benzos at night to fall asleep. Once I finally started performing well, that only reinforced my terrible habits. I thought that if I stopped \u201cself-medicating\u201d, I would fall behind and they would fire me. \n\nI cried every day. I was also the only female employee on the software team, and I got these paranoid thoughts in my head that my male coworkers didn\u2019t really like me (in retrospect, I\u2019m sure my alienation was totally my fault and a result of my anxiety). I didn\u2019t even like the programming anymore. When I was in college, I interned with people who were using software to help charities, uncover bogus statistics, and generally lift up communities. My job was nothing like that. The people there acted like they were curing cancer, but the majority of what we did boiled down to helping huge companies build training platforms that were more \u201chip\u201d and \u201ccool.\u201d\n\nSo I quit. Not just that job, but the whole field. I had started abusing harder drugs as well, and I knew I was going to end up killing myself. I went to rehab, and then I went back to school and got my Master\u2019s degree in Education with a focus in mathematics. \n\nI\u2019m a private tutor and a substitute teacher now. I hope to get my PhD one day, but for now I am happy helping young people realize their dreams. I set my own schedule so that I\u2019m able to pursue my passions: volunteering at a children\u2019s hospital tutoring sick kids that need to miss school, and helping young women from local battered women\u2019s shelters and homeless shelters learn graphic design and programming so that they can have valuable marketable job skills.\n\nI\u2019m two years clean from drugs and I have the most wonderful friends and a purrfect kitty! I am so, so happy I quit my job. Even though people thought I was insane for leaving the tech field (and I\u2019m sure my mom\u2019s friends talked shit about me behind her back), I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pay them any mind.",

It didn\u2019t feel right to push the extras on this man, considering the circumstances.

What should have been a roughly $50 purchase for this man ended costing him close to $100 when all was said and done.

Don't do that, once a tourniquet is on remember (and mark the person if you can) what time it was applied and leave the rest to doctors in a stable environment. Loosening a tourniquet may result in blood loss returning which requires re-tightening it. Tightening/loosening repeatedly may cause (on top of additional blood loss) blood to pool up inside the limb which can cause even more damage.\n\nEdit: ~~It's going to take over two hours for muscle/nerve damage to start occurring and about six until everything is dead and needing an amputation.~~\n\nMany a folks have said that recent advances have prolonged that time, I can't find a source to validate that but it seems believable (would like one if anybody has one!) as TQ use has heavily increased in the military and civilian world the past 15 years thanks to the CAT so I'm guessing surgeons have worked with them more. \n\nThis much more recent study cites that most amputations are due to the injuries sustained, not tourniquet use:\n\n>A multicenter study demonstrated 88% effectiveness in prehospital tourniquet application with significantly lower mortality and amputation rates than in American military experience\n\n>Kragh et al\u2019s military cohort had a 35% amputation rate, with several civilian series having a frequency of 17% to 29%.\n\n>we theorize that injury severity was critical in the decision to amputate than the presence of a tourniquet. A significant number of the initial amputations had mangled, nearly amputated arms or legs from high-speed motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle crash. Despite the higher rate of initial amputation, there was no increase in morbidity, mortality, or length of stay in TQ+ patients.\n\nhttps://tsaco.bmj.com/content/4/1/e000267\n\nOld source edit: >~~Continuous application for longer than 2 h can result in permanent nerve injury, muscle injury (including contractures, rhabdomyolysis and compartment syndrome), vascular injury and skin necrosis.8 Muscle damage is nearly complete by 6 hours, with likely required amputation. Numerous studies have been performed to determine the maximum duration of tourniquet use before complications. The general conclusion is that a tourniquet can be left in place for 2 h with little risk of permanent ischaemic injury.~~\n\n>~~A policy of periodic loosening of a tourniquet in an attempt to reduce limb ischaemia has often led to incremental exsanguination and death.12~~\n\n~~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2660095/~~"

The canals suffered silt buildup, so a cut was made in the bank of the Colorado River to further increase the water flow. The resulting outflow overwhelmed the engineered canal, and the river flowed into the Salton Basin for two years, filling the historic dry lake bed and creating the modern sea, before repairs were completed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salton_Sea)\n\nThe sea has occurred naturally several times in the past, but its current iteration is an accident. \n",

            "I live in NYC and there are a few restaurants with a no-tipping policy. They provide a salary and health benefits to their staff. Overall the food is a little pricier, but without tipping it evens out. I enjoy it more because I don't feel like they are constantly trying to upsell me and the social interaction doesn't feel monetized. It's nice ",
            "I really like how my company handles it. They pay us a very reasonable wage, and we do make tips, but evenly distribute it based on hours worked. So it really just feels like an extra bonus rather than a necessity to live on.",
            "Most people in the service industry would be against it, ironically. ",
            "I\u2019ve only ever had two kinds of jobs ; those with minimum wage and those where I was tipped. \nI\u2019ve always been better off with my tipping wages versus the \u201cflat\u201d hourly.  I\u2019m a bartender now and I can make a somewhat decent living.  ",
            "I\u2019m all for it, but no one in the industry will ever go for it. Restaurants like it because they don\u2019t have to pay as much. Waitstaff like it because they make good money off tips. If we move the other way, restaurants will pay more and waitstaff will make less no way it\u2019ll ever change.",
            "It would take a lot of uncertainty out of the job, pizza delivery driver here. Though I'm sure a lot of servers and bartenders would complain about not making 50-100 dollars+ an hour anymore. I'd think people could still leave tips for really outstanding service.\n\nEdit: been a server, worked in food industry fine and not for over 10 years. I know a lot of people in the industry. Mileage will vary. Obviously. I live in portland Maine. ",
            "Most of these comments seem to be missing the point. Of course wait staff want to keep tips for all the reasons given herein. What\u2019s missing (as far as I can see) is *why* is waiting one if the last professions (in the States) where the burden of compensation is placed directly on the patron? US native here who knows the custom well, but has been abroad long enough to see it for the sham that it is. If the establishment has to raise prices to fully compensate their wait staff, then so be it. It keeps out the riff raff who won\u2019t pay the extra difference and stiffs because they\u2019re not obligated. A *gratuity* is just that. Something extra for doing your job exceptionally well. It shouldn\u2019t be a substitute for fair compensation. \n\nLook forward to all the waiters down voting e to oblivion, but in what rational world does this still make sense? ",
            "I thought it was a good idea until my daughter got a job as a waitress. She makes waaaay more with tips than she would without.",
            "This kind of happened In Maine and it was quickly turned around by the public. For every person that complains they don't make enough in tips there is someone walking away with 200+ a night in their pockets. I've spent 12 years in the service industry. Sure, when it's slow wait staff makes less. But on a busy night hands down wait staff makes more than most in the kitchen. Same with bartenders. \n\nThis has variables though which makes it difficult. If you work in a small place with low turnover your likely to make less. If you work in a small town diner and deal with a lot of regulars you will most likely make less. Fine dining tends to pull in more. Same goes for high volume, high turnover places. \n\nLet me shed some light on what happens in lots of restaurants. Most line cooks that are in charge of a station and have an important role make 12-15 an hour if they are lucky. (Some states have higher wages but I'm talking Maine here). OR they get shift pay. The last fine dining place I worked was shift pay and it's the main reason I don't cook anymore. You would work 10 to 14 hours a day with little or no breaks. 5 or 6 days a week. You would get 2 staff meals and a shift drink. That would earn you 125 to 150 a day. Sure that sounds great. Then you talk to the wait staff. They come in a 3pm, leave at 11pm. Have very little prep and are responsible for a 4 table section. They would work 4 or 5 days a week. On a slow night it's not hard to walk out with 250 in tips. Remember this is fine dining so the tip percentage is higher. On a busy night 300 to 400 easy. If you got a VIP in your section that number could easily double. Like I said this is one place and it is defiantly not the norm but it is quite possible to make a very comfortable living off of a tipped wage. ",

            "When my children were young, there was a co-worker/friend of my wife who became a de-facto aunt to my children, and sister to  my wife and I.  She was single, and most of her family, whom she didn't get along with, lived hours away.  We lived near my wife's family, and they all treated her as if she were one of us.\n\nOne spring, she had been fighting a bad cold/mild flu.  As with most teachers, she worked multiple jobs.  Her second job (at that time) was working at the Hallmark store in the mall.  Early one evening, I answered the phone (we had a landline back then), and a young woman asked for my wife.  I could tell the girl was upset.  My wife got on another phone, and I listened in curious to why the girl was upset.  She said she worked at the Hallmark with our friend.  Our friend wasn't feeling well and went into the bathroom.  After about 30-45 minutes, the girl on the phone thought she'd go check on our friend.  There was no response from the knock.  The girl got the key and opened the bathroom door to find our friend, in her early 30s, dead on the toilet.  The paramedics were called, but they couldn't revive her.  The girl didn't know if our friend had family nearby, but she knew my wife was good friends with this woman and looked up our number in the phone book.\n\nThe girl was understandably upset, and the news made me very sad, but the noise my wife made chilled me to the bone, made me sick to my stomach, and got me started crying.   Nearly 20 years later, my stomach still rolls recalling my wife's anguished cry.  I never want to hear that again.\n\nIt turns out our friend had a fast growing tumor in her abdomen that was slowly squeezing off the blood supply to her internal organs.  What she thought was a flu was her organs slowly starving and shutting down.",

Also, as you might(or not) imagine, turning during sleep is awkward as my left arm doesn't just come along so i have to pick my left arm up in order to turn over.\n\nI mostly just lay on my back as any other position is just awkward. I have thought of amputating my arm but have not done it as i feel an arm in a sling will attract less looks as no arm at all.\n\nFun fact, sometimes my right arm falls asleep when i sleep so i wake up with 2 arms that can't function.

Almost all amputees have some degree of residual limb pain, obviously varying in severity. When you transect a limb, scar tissue forms, bony overgrowth occurs, and nerves form often painful structures known as neuromas.\n\nThese issues impact their lives in many aspects -- quality of sleep is a huge problem for many as nerve pain tends to be worse at night.\n\nThe media depiction where your arm is cut off and now its basically the same thing but shorter is totally fiction. Very few people are better off after an amputation than they were before.\n\nLimb amputation is a chronic disease which negatively impacts people in a *lot* of ways. I often do pre-amputation counseling and it's amazing how many people falsely believe that their lives will be drastically improved after an elective amputation. As good as our newest prosthetic devices are, nothing beats your native limb if it's still functional. Elective amputation rarely solves the patient's problem, especially if its pain.\n\nedit: removed GoT spoiler oops",

            "I was a summer teacher at one of those Korean SAT prep school that hired U.S College students for a summer, and then promptly worked them to death (although, I will admit the pay was pretty good). We taught 8.30 am thru 5.30 pm with an hour lunch, but had homework to grade every evening, prep work, etc.  Well, they were mainly focused on teaching English, but I was a math and physics major, so they had me teaching SAT math and college prep physics. No problem. \n\n\nThen they decided since I studied physics, I should also teach their chemistry class. I tried to tell them I didn't know much chemistry, but they insisted. So I worked my ass off, refreshing myself on all of the stuff before I taught it, while still teaching another Math and Physics class. \n\nOne day in the middle of this I got legitimetly sick. I called in the night before, per the rules, and told them I couldn't come in. I took one day off, sleeping in my apartment, and then dragged myself in the next day. When I show up, they pull me aside and say \"So how do you plan on making up the time for the classes you've missed?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"Well, we didn't have anyone to teach your classes, so all the kids are behind now. You have to make up the time. We figured you could just extend your morning class an hour for the first week (aka- teach over lunch) and your afternoon class could then start an hour early for the next week.\" \"Why didn't you have a sub teach my class?\" Then they screwed up, they said \"We don't have a sub.\" \n\n\"Well then, no, I'm not going to skip my lunch because of your guys poor planning.\"\n\n\"We'll fire you, and then you won't get your plane ticket remebursed\" they replied. \n\n\"Go ahead. First, I followed the rules and gave you notice I was going to be out. Second, you just told me you don't have a sub for my classes. That means if I leave, you're going to lose all of those students that I'm teaching. That will cost you a lot more than the planet ticket will cost me.\"\n"

            "A while back some guy on here was talking about his experience working as a sort of personnel manager for a billionaire and how things are just wildly different for them.\n\nThe specific example he used was how things work when these people want to go on a trip, and give any notice at all to their employees.\n\nWhat happens is that an advanced team gets sent ahead by a few days to scope out the rented/bought location and report back exact dimensions for closet space, drawer space, etc. People back at the home go through the clothing, jewelry, etc, and draw up a priority list which is sent to the advanced team. The advanced team then spends the next two days purchasing the list of items. Entire wardrobes, jewelry sets, makeup kits, bathing supplies, etc. Anything they cannot get (not enough time, or is one-of-a-kind like the family heirloom watch the rich dude wears every now and then) is relayed to the house-team. The family's schedule is arranged such that the moment the family leaves the house on the day of travel, a whole team of people rushes through and packs up all the remaining items (only after the family leaves, you wouldn't want to deny them access to their items for even a few seconds) which are then sent ahead to the airport while the family has a lunch or something somewhere. Upon landing, their luggage takes one route (direct) and the family takes a similarly indirect route (unless otherwise directed) such that by the time they get to the location all of their items are not just unpacked but in their proper organized locations and ready for use without any of the advanced team ever being visible to the family.\n\nWhat happens when the family leaves the location? The same situation in reverse, but quite frequently all of the repurchased items are just disposed of in some method. It's just easier, if not cheaper, to rebuy them each time the family goes somewhere if they aren't travelling to too many different locations in quick succession.",

Protect with some leaves.\n\nSpring onions or jalape\u00f1os melted into cheese is such a game changer.\n\nIf you've got a flavoursome meat like pastrami it is sometimes worth using a more simpler bread (such as white for the simplest example) so the flavour of the meat is brought out. However if I were making a pastrami sandwich I'd use light rye over wholemeal but white bread over granary.\n\nTo spread your mayo and mustard on the bread better and more evenly rotate the slice and spread then rotate again until back to the first.\n\nCut your sandwich into triangles and be gentle - let the knife do the work. Don't put pressure into your sandwich and squish it and tear it apart.\n\nMeat on the bottom, then cheese, then salad. Exception when salads go with meat - gherkins, sometimes jalape\u00f1os, sauerkraut even.\n\nMustard with meat, Mayo with salad.\n\nTomato based sauces with cheese are great. Tomato relish, ketchup, etc.\n\nSwiss cheese with beef. Always. \n\nCinnamon and raisin bagels go well with savoury fillings.\n\nTuna and cranberry is very popular.\n\nDon't forget to pepper your salads - specifically tomatoes. ",

Her father died in the accident and no one in her family was comfortable directly explaining this to the child. They had used a lot of religious euphemisms about death (he\u2019s watching over you in Heaven, he\u2019s with you in spirit) but this language is not concrete enough for a young child who doesn\u2019t really understand death.  \n\nSitting with this child (body brace, lacerations all over, very flat affect) and explaining to her what death was, that her father had died, and having to ask questions to make sure she understood was one of the most traumatizing experiences of my graduate training.

It wasn't unusual to see other people in the park, even in the middle of the night like this. What is unusual is that you could see the person was dressed in white from head to toe. As he got closer a silence fell over all of us as we realized, holy fucking shit that is a person...in a goddamn snow suit! We were terrified and amazed all at once. \n\nHe sat on a bench a little down the path from us. Just...sitting there. One of my more adventurous, or stupid maybe, friends went over. Sat on the bench a bit then came back over. \n\nSnowsuit man didn't ask to get his ass kicked like we heard. In fact he didn't respond or even acknowledge my friends presence.

He was trying to improve his Spanish, so he was bargaining with all the taxistas after he arrived to the airport as practice. After failing in his negotiations with a number of taxistas, he finally found someone who would take his lowball fare, an unmarked taxi.\n\nSo he was just chatting with the taxista, not paying much attention to the road, eventually noticing that they were getting more and more rural. Just as he he was about to say something about the route, the taxista pulled over and like 6 or 8 guys jammed in the car, and then they drove off like a bat out of hell.\n\nMy friend couldn't believe that this taxista, who seemed really nice, was actually pulling this on him. After a while, they pulled over and tried to push him into the trunk. Fortunately, my friend is super strong and they couldn't force him in the trunk so they pushed him back in the back seat.\n\nThey drove off, and my friend was able to finagle the door handle open from the back seat. Then he wedged himself half out of the car as they were speeding off, with one hand on his backpack (I know - forget the stupid backpack!).\n\nThe men shouted to the driver, \"faster faster!\" (in Spanish of course). So my friend gave one final tug with his backpack and flew out of the car. Dazed, he looked up and saw an elderly Peruvian woman throwing rocks at the car (it had stopped after he jumped out). And then the car sped off.\n\nThe next thing he remembered, he was naked in a bathtub in one of these small homes in rural Peru.

I didn\u2019t exactly like my new step mom, but I didn\u2019t hate her. I think I just thought that the relationship wouldn\u2019t last and he\u2019d move on to someone better. Then they got married and it was kinda weird. I did get an amazing baby brother from that - not all bad.\n\nMy dad died when I was 17. Literally taken out by an undiagnosed severe allergy. My step-mom got me from school and drove me to the hospital, and when my dad passed away, she handed me my baby brother and said she needed a minute by herself. I never saw her again. \n\nShe was much younger than my dad, and was an ex-foster are kid with no family or best friends to support her -  and I think she looked at her newborn baby and the kid her dead husband inherited and just couldn\u2019t handle it. I sure know I wasn\u2019t prepared to handle it - but my mom and my (biological) dad had been ex-foster care kids and mom told me a few fucked stories so I wasn\u2019t going to let that happen to me or my brother. I do sometimes feel a little resentful that I can\u2019t have the normal life - I\u2019m working too much, and I have a six year old to figure out, to consider college but I don\u2019t want my family to just be cycles of poverty and dead-end jobs.\n\n**Edit: Wow guys! I\u2019m touched by the response. I have full custody - my step-dad adopted me when my Mom died so for all intents and purposes, my brother is legally my brother. Afraid I can\u2019t give too many details - I want to adopt him and there\u2019s a court case or two that I don\u2019t wanna compromise just in case - movies have told me that anyway! \n\nStep-mom will probably be charged with abandonment when she can be located - but so far we haven\u2019t heard anything. I\u2019ve always been worried that she had a mental health break and either killed herself (I used to call up locally and ask for Jane Doe\u2019s that fit her - hey coping mechanisms amirite?) or she\u2019s had a mental health break and something snapped. Abandonment didn\u2019t really fit what I knew of her - and I remember that she had some kind of mental health problems - it\u2019s not like we talked about it though. She could have gone off her meds in the chaos and snapped. I\u2019m more worried than angry - but my first concern will always be for my favourite little tyke. \n\nWe\u2019re doing pretty well - we have a support worker who has been fantastic, helping us get access to free and reduced cost services. I\u2019m also pretty thrifty - I youtube\u2019d how to knit socks and fix clothing and thrift stores are great. I don\u2019t live near a major city, and so it\u2019s not as expensive as it could have been. Being frugal also helps.\n\nThere\u2019s usually always good stuff out there if you know how to ask for help - and my dad always told me the hardest thing but the most important thing to do was to suck up your pride and ask for help. I\u2019m getting better about that, but it\u2019s hard. My dad making me do therapy helped a bunch to admit when I need help - he said that needing help wasn\u2019t about not being capable, but about being smart. That if you\u2019re carrying an expensive tv you **could** carry it by yourself but you\u2019re smarter if you grab a friend. \n\nI\u2019m almost finished an apprenticeship right now - and I\u2019m in a Union that\u2019s decent enough that wives used to drop off casseroles and leave cribs and stuff on our porch. Everyone should be involved in their community. I wouldn\u2019t have survived without everyone willing to go to bat for me. \n\nI\u2019m working pretty hard because I\u2019m incredibly fortunate that I met good people along the way. I owe them a lot.  I also work part time at a nursery helping with plants and stuff on weekends for the staff discount and free stuff. I taken home more than a few half-dead fruit trees and vegetable seedlings. The more I work, the more I can throw into savings. It\u2019s morbid but I want to make sure if I die, he\u2019s not frantically worrying about paying for that. It\u2019s - not exactly a good feeling.\n\nMy bro and I have been working on expanding our tiny garden to try and off set the cost of food and he seems to like gardening just as much as my dad did. Last year we didn\u2019t buy a single potato or any herbs. It\u2019s been the best low-cost high-involved activity we\u2019re doing - and it sometimes makes me feel less guilty that I can\u2019t be there more for him like our dad was for me.\n\nWe have glass pasta jars and tin cans growing basil and rosemary right now - I told my bro if he can keep them alive all year without me needing to intervene, we can look at adopting chickens. He specifically wants two chickens named ChicKEN and ChicBARBIE because he\u2019s funnier than I am. \n\nI\u2019m working a bunch now because I want him to be in a better position in the future - my dad left a small, but decent amount in a trust - and I pulled from it when I first got custody when I was scrambling to afford everything. I want to replace everything I took, and also make sure he can afford to do the things that I couldn\u2019t when growing up. When he\u2019s in high school and wants to celebrate by going to Mexico, then he\u2019s going to Mexico. \n\nI do miss the stuff I can\u2019t do - I\u2019ve never not had responsibilities. I\u2019m still friends with people from school, and they\u2019re doing cross-country adventures and dropping money on expensive stuff. It\u2019s such a weird idea that they can just go to music festivals without worrying about anything while I\u2019m trying to find a detergent that doesn\u2019t set the bro\u2019s eczema off. Wouldn\u2019t trade him for the world though. \n\nWe have saving accounts and insurance policies and I\u2019m probably better off than a lot of people. The comments have been incredible with people offering help from everywhere - I needed that help when I was 17 and scared out of my absolute mind. \n\nI\u2019m almost 24 now and I\u2019m stable - but paranoid and weird for sure. If you\u2019d like to donate, please direct them to local organisations fighting the good fight. The difficult part of the story is basically over - until he hits teenaged years probably. God knows how I\u2019m going to handle that. That\u2019s a problem for future me. I don\u2019t need that kind of help anymore, and I\u2019m moving into the phase of life where I just want to give back to people that have helped me, by passing it on. I joined reddit because I saw that post that said \u201cToday you, tomorrow me\u201d - that\u2019s my philosophy in life.\n\nThere are a lot of people out there like me, and they deserve to be able to grow garlic in old jam jams with their family just as much as I did.**",

            "When I was five, my dad came home from work, and my mom informed him out, completely of the blue, that she wanted an immediate divorce (I found out many years later she'd had an affair and was pregnant). He moved out of the house (they had three little kids together; I was the oldest), and she married her second husband (twice; they weren't divorced the first time). He was paying child support as he was supposed to, but she was calling him at work and sending him letters at home (his sister kept them), asking for more, and he began to get complaints about it from his bosses. He asked his mother what he should do; she advised him to tell her he was giving her all he could, and all he was ordered to, and that he was going to lose his job if she kept it up. And, that if she didn't stop, he'd leave the state, and she'd never hear from him again. She thought that would make her wise up and leave him alone. So, he did. But she continued. So, he asked his mother for advice again. Her advice was to follow through. And so, he did. He packed his clothes into his car, and headed for Canada. He got as far as two states north from where he began, liked a little town he came across, and got a job there. \n\nI never forgot him. I was the only one of the three of us kids that had any memories of him. But when I was 16 and moved away from my *extremely* abusive home (in every way), I called my aunt, whose name I knew, who happened to live in the town I was also then living in, and told her I wanted to meet him. Coincidentally, he happened to be visiting her. I met him, my aunt, my grandfather, and my grandmother while he was there. It turned out to be the only time I would ever meet my grandfather; he died two years later. But I will never, *ever* forget it - he wrapped me up in a big, strong bearhug; told me how beautiful I was; how much he loved me, and how much he'd ALWAYS loved me, and how very, very happy he was to see me again after all these years. I cried then, and I'm crying again now, writing it down. I can still feel the love and caring in his arms. \n\nI wasn't ready to get to know my dad at 16 though; I realize now that I just wanted to \"see\" him. It took me another 10 years before I contacted him again. But I did; when I was living in California. And when I did, he took two weeks vacation (so did I), drove down to see me, and we spent the entire two weeks getting to know one another. And once he left, we were in contact daily. And I quit my job and moved up to the PNW a month later, because I knew the hole in my heart would never be filled until my dad was a part of my life. And I was correct. \n\nMy son has a grandpa because of my decision, and my dad is the greatest grandpa there is. I wish he'd have always been in my life, but the outcome I received is worth everything I've been through. I love you, Dad. <3",

        "bestcomment": [
            "The entire party was about to die until they rolled to see if a players weasel familiar could remove the cork from a health potion and pour it into the wizards mouth. He could and they all lived.",
            "I had a player wish for himself to be turned into a stone block. He'd been sent back in time somehow, I forget exactly how as this game happened in 1996, and was trying to find a way back. So he figured he could stand where the party was when he got sent back in time, wish himself to be turned into a stone block with a message chiseled on it reading \"Wish for me to be turned into [character name]\" His logic was they'd find the stone block waiting on their approach and his character would use his wish to change him back before being sent back in time.\n\nSo, I did that. Then I said to him, \"Why didn't you just wish to go back to your own time?\" He said, \"Oh, I didn't think of that.\" And he was duly laughed at by everyone.",
            "My players tend to do some ridiculous stuff to the point where I could probably fill an entire thread with their shenanigans, but the first and best would probably have to be weaponizing butter.\n\nDuring the first session the party found themselves in a small town library trying to figure out what's going on. Among other things they found a book with 1001 uses for butter, just as a throwaway detail. They check it out as well and I think nothing of it.\n\nAfter the session I ask for downtime actions and the party's mad scientist comes to me and says \"I want to make explosive butter.\" I have him roll for it and he aces it. He then posts a picture to our facebook group along the lines of \"chicken + stick of butter = [chicken shaped blast shadow] + cooked chicken\"\n\nThe rest of the group runs with this and it leads to an ever increasing spiral of butter related weaponry and paraphernalia. Buying a cow to secure their own supply and hiding it in their basement. Adding some herbs and spices to the mix and creating the basting grenade. After building a BPG, a different player took a skill specialty in food-based weaponry.\n\nThis of course deserved an equally weird response in kind. See, this kind of abuse of butter didn't go unnoticed, namely by the butter deity herself, Paula Deen. She waged a campaign of harassment against the party for infringing on her domain, eventually culminating in summoning a skyscraper-sized sentient corn on the cob to crush them.\n\nIn the lore of this world, butter is now a highly controlled substance and the French have become the most formidable military power in the world. Even when telling non-butter related stories from this game, I can only ever refer to it as \"Buttergame.\"\n\ntl;dr: Players weaponize butter, antagonize Paula Deen, propel French to military supremacy ",
            "Session 1. First session all of us have ran in.\n\nSave my daughter says the sad villager\n\nOK says the party\n\nGoes through the dungeon.\n\nSees girl\n\n\"I firebolt her\"\n\nMe: \"what... What?\"\n\n\"yup\"\n\n\n\nThe girl was an illusion and the mission was a trick to get the party to unearth an ancient evil. They figured out one half, the girl was a trick.\nStill unearthed the evil.\n\nBut the whole party including myself was very surprised to see the coward sorcerer shoot a firebolt at a child instead of the skeleton boss. ",
            "They turned the game into SimCity.\n\nPCs are thrown in into a dungeon for witchcraft, get broken out by an agent of the king, who knows they are innocent. Wants them to take down the guy who's going around accusing anyone he considers impure of witchcraft; because he's \"cleaning up\" the kingdom, he has the support of a lot of nobles who are bigoted fucks. That's why the throne can't act too openly against him, and decides to employ the PCs; if they kill him, everyone will just assume it's out of revenge.\n\nKing's agent basically gives them directions to where they can find this guy, but they get caught up on the detail of some of the nobles being in with him, and decide they want more details. They ask for an example, I throw out the name \"Lord Hobbes\" at random, and now the quest is suddenly \"Investigate Lord Hobbes for corruption while completely ignoring the guy who is actually responsible for all of this\".\n\nSo now I need to make a map of Hobbes' mansion and grounds for them to infiltrate, stat out guards and such, and invent something to happen. Turns out Hobbes is being blackmailed into compliance and isn't that bad a guy, he tries to hire the PCs himself to go after Witchfinder Douchebag so I can get things back on rails, and then just to tie off this plot cul de sac, one of the Witchfinder's agents kills him. PCs finally go after the guy they were supposed to go after, save the day, and as a reward I have the king give them Hobbes' title and mansion so I can reuse the nice map I made as their base, and all seems well. Of course, now they are technically the rulers of a small town.\n\nImmediately this becomes their primary focus, ignoring any and all other plot hooks. They want to improve the town (which I now also need to map in detail), invest money, collect taxes, pass ordinances, improve trade routes, etc. Adventuring is now just a way to acquire funds and defeat threats to the town, which starts growing at an alarming rate. Gaming sessions are now 70% discussions on trade, revenue allocation, and fiddling with the town map. ",
            "In one of my campaigns we had a knight who relied on mounted combat to be effective. He told me after creating his character that he had a contingency plan should his horse die, and all the details. His character came with a buff and mute armorer named Patsy and a little squire (whose name as far as anyone knew was squire). I was hesitant to add so many characters, but since one was mute I allowed it.\n\nEventually his horse is killed and he turns a side eye to me and goes \"I activate the contingency plan\". All the other players are so confused and dying laughing, as he begins to execute his backup. He pulls a backpack harness out of one of his packs and straps it onto Patsy's back, then climbs in and grabs his lance, and yells \"Yah Patsy!\". He practically piggybacks the rest of the game in order to get his mounted combat bonus.\n\nOne of the other players asked \"is Patsy okay with this?\"\nAnd he responded \"Patsy has long dreamed of this day\"",
            "Their very first quest was \"find out where the dwarves have gone\".\n\nOne year of weekly gaming later (five years in-game) the dumb fucks finally decided to see where the dwarves went. They were in the mountains. They were always in the goddamn mountains.",
            "Recently they were sneaking through a goblin nest when the ranger felt the foot of a sleeping goblin gently rest against her.  It was meant to warn the players that the hollows surrounding them were filled with goblins and that they should continue to be careful.\n\nShe says \"I reach out with both hands and choke it to death\".\n\n... wha... what?\n\nA high roll later, the rest of the group see the ranger do this and proceed to pull bone daggers and other small weapons and follow suit.  Now they are crawling in and out of dirt holes, murdering sleeping goblins left and right.\n\nNormally their rolls are cursed but not this time.  No low rolls, several natural 20s and a few minutes later they have brutally murdered ~50 goblins and are covered from head to toe in blood, high fiving each other for being the good guys.",
            "One of the early plot hooks was an excommunicated priest having a vision of an angry bear guarding a cave. They got into a debate reminiscent of the swallow-coconut debate in Monty Python about whether a bear can properly be said to be angry. They eventually decided to look for the bear, not to investigate the vision, but to see what an angry bear looks like.",
            "Our DM always did custom campaigns. There would be special items made up by him and he would make unique classes for each of us to play. He was really good at it and our group played for years and had some awesome adventures.   \nOne time I was leaning a little to hard into my chaotic evil side and long story short my team sold me to a group of devils from one of the planes of hell. They took me to this ancient relic thing that would transform me into a being of hell (what i got was based on my role from a percentage die so out of 100, 1%-95%being terrible 96%-100% being i might get something good). I had a one time use item where i could pick my roll, some mystic scroll about deciding fates. So i chose 100%. The dm turned me into a fallen archangel. Boys o boys did i knock that campaign off course when i showed back up. "

Icing on BOTH primary pitot tubes maybe, though that shouldn\u2019t happen (they are heated). \n\nIn any case, we ended up making a perfectly safe landing after a diversion, and the passengers never had any idea that, for a few minutes, I was really concerned that things were about to turn very, very bad and that we were down to our emergency backup gauge. \n\nThat\u2019s the shortened version without most of the techno-babble anyway.

            "I worked labor and delivery. Had a very young mother come in, accompanied by her parents. She was just 12-13 and parents looked stuffy and kept telling her should've had an abortion, she was too young, etc. Her mother was silent the whole time but leaked tears for her constantly. While she labored, I received a call from a very young boy who said he was her boyfriend. His trembly voice explained that her father wouldn't come to the hospital. I explained that I couldn't give out information but he could talk to her afterward.I went in, told her he had called and she showed me a picture of him. He was white, straight red hair, pimply and tiny--the runt of the litter. \nAbout an hour later, her phys ed teacher stopped by to check on her, which I thought was odd. We didn't get many teachers checking on students. He was as opposite of the boyfriend as he could get: tall, very muscular, beautiful smile, and rich, chocolate brown skin. \nThe girl's father accompanied her to the delivery room. Odd, but ok. The more she pushed, the louder she cried. In between, she kept say \"sorry daddy\"\". Finally, out slid a very beautiful, chocolate brown baby boy. I thought her father was going to pass the Fuck out on my delivery room floor. I did my usual \"it's a boy!\" And said nothing else. I handed him off to a nursery nurse and got dad a chair. The new mom said \"I'm sorry daddy,\" over and over again. Her mom, now frowned up, came to see the baby, took one look, started asking God for forgiveness, and left. I sent her dad home a short bit later, admonishing him to react at home, not here. I set up a time for our counselor to meet with him before I left. After talking to new mom, she admitted her gym teacher had been giving her \"special treatment\". I explained sex to her and she said she'd only kissed the bff, but had stayed after school to be with her gym teacher. I'm state mandated to report child abuse, so I did. Two weeks later, with her world shattered, her baby was given up for adoption. I wish her the best. Of note, this was 1989.",

After sitting there for about 2 hours, he walks out with a smirk on his face and says \"let's go\", we all thought something horrible had happened. Her friends ask how the baby is, and he said \"fine, but black\". He motioned for us to go, so we followed him. In the parking garage, he tells us to follow him to his apartment, then sends me a text asking I could put him up for a while. We literally moved him out of his apartment and into my spare bedroom in like an hour tops. Her parents didn't know who to be mad at. The confusion on their faces when he told them the baby was black was priceless. "

My grandmother was frail and suffered from arthritis and in fact she passed not long after this. As she was walking to the door she fell down in the living room. I had no key to the house and I was freaking out. I had no idea what to do. I was ready to freaking break the living room window in or call 911 then she somehow managed to climb back up using furniture to prop herself back to a standing position and open the door. After that day I demanded a key to the house from my parents.\n\nI hate to think what would've happened if she didn't miraculously get back up. I felt so helpless. Nearly as hopeless as the time my maternal grandfather fell crossing a busy street and traffic was starting back up down the street.

            "It was years ago, when I was in 4th grade. My parents used to get into fights all the time, especially when my dad was drinking. They'd start yelling and that would turn into actual fist fights. At this time we were living in a small trailer, and the room I shared with all 3 of my siblings was at one end of the trailer, near the back door.\n\nSo my dad comes home drunk, mom is pissed and starts yelling and it escalates from there. Being in a small trailer everything sounds so close and terrifying, and as the oldest of 4 I felt the need to protect my siblings but I didn't know what to do. After a while my mom starts screaming my name at the top of her lungs and I can still hear my dad screaming too, and I knew that I needed to get myself and my siblings out of there ASAP. I ushered them out of the room, down the hallway, and out the backdoor and told them to head to our aunt's place, who lived a few trailers down. My mom was still screaming for me and all I knew to do was yell \"I got them out Mom we're leaving!\" before also going out the back to my aunt's. I don't recall ever being that scared. Cops came, they both went to jail and were both out in a couple days and acted like nothing ever happened.\n\nA few years ago I brought the incident up to my mom. I told her that I thought she was screaming at me to get my siblings out of the house and that's why I had. She told me she was screaming my name cause she was scared and wanted help and didn't know who else to call for. I felt so bad cause I didn't help her, but there's not really much I could've done.",

So, S thought he had to be the man of the house. I was a busy trauma nurse on call a lot and was hardly home, but when I was, S would barbecue dinner and be really miffed if I didn\u2019t want it etc. that\u2019s just one example, but that type of behavior escalated.

When we got back we found that he was still there after an hour and a half STILL cleaning our parking lot! We were amazed and grateful so we struck up a conversation. \n\nHe seemed like a normal guy. He used to be a business owner, he fixed roofs for a living, he made decent money before he was homeless, he used to be married, he has kids. Unfortunately his life kind of spiralled after he got mixed up in meth use.\n\nWe just sort of thought of him as a normal dude who got mixed up with the wrong substance and then got screwed over by the system. That is until he mentioned that the construction on our main street was a plot by the city to find the Templar's treasure, that he HIMSELF was a Templar descendent, and when he claimed that I specifically am the unknowing descendant of Templars.

            "My husband's cousin is the only female in the family that is around my age so when we used to go to family functions I tended to hang out with her. Our friendship blossomed and she was who I considered to be my best friend. We both had three kids and they all loved each other so we just spent a lot of time together. \n\nMy husband always told me she was crazy... That she would turn on me. But I just thought they grew up together and had some weird kind of sibling rivalry kind of thing going on. \n\nHer ex husband hated her... Court cases for custody were happening all the time, it was nasty, they weren't allowed to be in the same room together per court order even. I only heard her side of the story so I, of course, just assumed it was him that was horrible.\n\nFast forward a few years, she is remarried and has a new baby with her new husband. She's an interior decorator and has always been struggling financially. But somehow all of a sudden she is buying all the things. New iPods for all the kids (including mine), gaming laptop for her oldest, furniture, electronics, she pays a year of rent so she \"won't have to think about it.\" \n\nWhile I'm over there because I'm now an \"approved supervisor\" for the supervised visitation her ex husband has imposed through the court, she starts screaming at her new husband for not loading the dishwasher correctly and pushes him fully, with real force, down the stairs. He somehow manages to be okay but she doesn't stop. Runs after him with clear plans to attack. The guy has to literally flee his own home. I packed up the three older kids and my kids and got out of there. I didn't report it because she guilted me into thinking she had PPD and would be fine.\n\nOne Valentine's day she decides she wants to have a party for the kids. The time didn't work out for me so I told her we couldn't attend. She lost her sit and called me every name she could think of. She took things I had said to her in confidence and told our whole family. I got pages and pages of scathing emails. I was crushed.\n\nFive years later she remarried again and had two more babies with a new guy. She called DCF on her 15 year old son claiming he sexually molested her 2 year old daughter... Had zero evidence but decided because she was \"acting weird\" that  this must have been what happened. After a heated altercation with new guy where police were called, she now has lost custody of all 6 kids and begs me to come to court to be a character witness. \n\nEdit because I forgot to explain the money spending... She had gotten a new big client who gave her an expense account to decorate his multi million dollar home. She spent about 200k of his money and was sued.",

I was eating at my local Subway sandwiches, woman comes to the counter. Pulls a dead bird from her coat and asks what type of sub she can get for the bird. Everybody turns and watches as the teenager behind the counter realizes whats going on. He starts yelling that she needs to leave because a dead bird is an obvious health thing. She gets mad that he's not even willing to hear her out, and storms off mumbling and swearing under her breath."

            "Hey, a question I can answer!\n\nI had just recently arrived in the system after sitting in county for a while, so was still in Diagnostics where all your processing like medical and affiliations and job placement stuff happens. I remember being still asleep when a guard turned on the lights and rolled the TV into the dorm. (Intake's had been torn down by the last batch, or maybe the batch before them.)  I remember my bunk was right by the plug, so I could sit there and be right to the side of the TV. My house was popular for a few days, lol. \n\nEveryone was confused at first, \"What the hell boss, why you waking us up?\", but his demeanor showed that something serious was up. Big grey-headed dude, usually jovial, was like \"Y'all quiet down and look at this.\" We thought it was just a crash at first, but he answered, \"No, we're under attack.\"  I'm not super sure about the timeline--he must have brought it on shortly after the Pentagon got hit? I remember seeing one of the towers fall, at least, but the memory is fuzzy. We were one somber bunch of hoodlums, though. \n\nThey left the TV in the dorm all that day, and most of the next. Like others have said, we didn't go out for a few days. We didn't go full lockdown, because they kept running the diagnostic stuff, but I can't speak for the rest of the camp.\n\nAmong the inmates, it was gossip as usual, hyped to the walls. There's gonna be a war, they're gonna let us out, gonna write my recruiter and get outta here, blah blah blah. The couple middle-eastern looking guys got some shit, but no beatings, at least in my pod. Again, stuck in intake so dunno about the rest of the camp. There was perhaps an increased sense of camaraderie, and lotsa talk from the veterans in the group.\n\nI guess I've never really thought about that morning from the perspective of anyone other than myself or a New Yorker before. Strange memory. Thanks for asking, person. ",
            "We didn't know what happened, we all thought somebody escaped. That's what the older prisoners told us anyway. No TV, no newspapers, no radio, no work (we were kitchen staff and served 2 meals per day) and we didn't have trays, instead it was bagged lunch for everybody (PB&J and a carton of milk) for three days. \n\nAfter the first 12-15 hours the older inmates were telling us \"It could be a riot in another block.\" because it was too quiet. Any stirs by the inmates, the loudspeaker would come on and tell us we are on lockdown.\n\nWhen we found out, 72 hours later, it was total shock. We were in California and we didn't know if our families were OK or what. I had to wait 2 hours to make a phone call to my family.\n\nI had to have my family in CA contact family in NJ and tell them to accept the collect call from me. I wouldn't take anybodies word that everyone was alive. ",
            "It was shortly after count had cleared and I had just walked outside to the yard before going to my job in the education department.  The inmate I worked with asked me if I heard that we were at war and that they had attacked New York. I remember my belly was in a knot thinking Oh shit were at war and I'm stuck in here and my family is out there. I grew up in the 80s and remembered that cold war fear that the Russians were gonna take over the country so that's what I was thinking when I heard war. I was only a few years into a very long sentence so I didn't know what to think. When we went into the classroom we rigged the TV to catch channels over the antenna, we were all glued to the TV and I'll never forget watching people jump to their deaths. I called my folks and said we loved each other and my dad reassured me that we weren't going to be taken over by another country. We had like 15 channels on TV in our units and I remember every single channel had the news on even BET. ",

Albany Regional Prison to be exact.\n3) I was locked up for a little over 3 months for Common Assault. I hit my Ex-wifes new partner after he hit (not smacked) one of my children, so I hit him. Worth it. \n*Edit 2) I would never have thought my highest rated comment would be about me being in Prison. It's not something I tell people about. \n*Edit 3) Gold.. Really?

Let people form an opinion around you.\nStep 3: if it's a group conversation, make yourself visible. Too many times i just didn't say anything in those conversations. I wasn't visible. \nStep 4: if you're cringy or awkward\u2026 embrace it!

She proceeded to talk to her friend and calmly say she was going to have a shower and hung up the call. She ran into the bathroom, locked the door and jumped out of the a window.

It\u2019s been a while since I read it) and attacked him. One thing led to another and she was dead and he was on the run. \n\nWhat pissed me off was all the people that were commenting saying they felt sorry for him. That it wasn\u2019t his fault and it was just a tragedy. \n\nBut if you read his post carefully you could tell a lot of things didn\u2019t add up, he was shifting the blame and making himself look better by throwing dirt on the girl he murdered. \n\nHe mentioned he\u2019d gotten into a fight with her friends boyfriend, but didn\u2019t mention they fought him because he was breaking and entering. \n\nHe said he shoved her and she hit her head and was yelling at him to get out, but before he left he wanted a hug and she attacked him because of it. \n\nHe said that her friends would back him up as long as they were honest. \n\nToo many things didn\u2019t add up and anyone using critical thinking could realize it but too many fell into his trap and thought he was the innocent guy that was having the shiftiest luck. \n\nHis name is Ager Hasan. Look him up. Read his post and then read what the authorities discovered about the crime and you\u2019ll get a first hand look at how abusers shift blame and why you should always be skeptical. \n\nAlso: I\u2019m pretty sure he stabbed her 37 times.

            "I created an escape in France with my wife, and we have a few nice things that happened to us. A room we have settles in 1979 were you have to go in the appartment/hideout of a gang of bank robbers to find back something for the government (based on a real story happened in our city). Sincce we do have a time machine which is the starting point of our all our stories, we send time agents on duty for our clients. Here the government that want theses cold war informations back.\n\n- we had a wedding proposal for which we changed the story where the guy actually hired us to find back and object that was stolen to his parents. The wedding ring happened to be this family previous object. => really nice wedding proposal and moment\n\n- in this mission, they are books. We made them casual and numerous so it is quite obvious no hidden info are on one random book there: on players spent most of the game to not participate anything but carefully look all over the books if something was strange. He was looking two things: if the page numbers were in order, and if a letter was not circled in a book. Even with multiple very straight forward clues, he did not wanted to stop because maybe the clues could be false leads.\n\n- as you could imagine, often and despite contrary briefing rules, people break things, including ceiling (in case some paper inside), wooden floor, write on the wall so everybody can see all info (despite white papers available). One time, someone litterally told us: \"it's ok, it's easy to change\" after breaking a furniture door to see what's inside.\n\n- we have on a mission a high, thin furniture, a big like those big old wood clock (I don't know the english name). A key is visible at the bottom and you have to fish it with cable and a magnet. On family wanted to pull there 5 yo boy inside, hanging by the feet: dangerous as hell !\n\n- Some players really look at strange, weird, overkilled theories to solve some challenges while it is actually the easiest part of the game. They sometimes are really insistive for us to say it was reaaaallly hard just so that players have no chances.\n\n- One day, we had the worst group ever. Well just as we have the best record for the room, you have to get the worst right ! They made about 10% of the game with help. By the end, and because we want them to see the full story, we help them like \"good, you found this information, our machine can compute the code, it's xxx, now you just have to [explain litterally how]. When the family left, the father told me \"really, not everyone can go through ? This seems so easy!\" hum... yes sure ! you were the best !\n\n- We have in one of our room a safe that is written on \"max three tries before definitely locked\". You have about 12 similar object with codes that are obviously for the safe and you must determine the correct one. One day, a player tried randomly  three out of them. After the safe locked, we had to unlocked it for them to continue. The player immediatly tried out three other ones. The safe locked again. Second manual intervention to unlock it. The player tried another one code and open the safe. At the endd of the game, I came back to it, to offer showing how to get the proper code. Answer: \"not need, I found it. It was quite easy actually.\" I pointed out randomly was not how it was meant: \"I did not made randomly, I made it by elimination. It's a pretty easy strategy\". Ohoh, did I mention it was the same player then the previous one ?!!\n\nThe thing I hate the most is when players get out of the room and because they did not succeed in some part are really insistive in saying: \"ok so we agree this [obviously some props requiring days of work] stuff was totally useless ?\". I sometimes don't know how to let them know that they litteraly ask the solution clue instead of trying. \n\nMy bad english (sorry for it) may sound like I am a hatefull personn.

            "I own an escape room and I once guided couple into one of our more moody ambiance room and they told me \"we would totally base a sex dungeon off this vibe. See, you even have a desk in here to get started!\"\n\nAlso you see people's true parenting skills. My favorite quote is from a lovely family that went into a room and 5 minutes in the father gathered his overeager children and told them \"you're being assholes\".\n\nWe're in a huge tech area and we get a lot of corporate groups with some very important people. A week ago we had a Fortune 500 CEO through and he walked up to my staff and started bragging about his 50,000 Instagram followers, basically trying to impress college kids. We definitely giggled about that one especially when we looked him up and he had like 300 followers. But hey, he killed it in the room!\n\n"

Couldn\u2019t kick it down like Chuck Norris, so I went and grabbed some tools and finally got it open.\n\nFound the kid, blue and cold on the floor.  His pulse was faint. There was a syringe next to him.  He had blood in his mouth so I couldn\u2019t make mouth to mouth contact and started administering chest compressions. The whole time his girlfriend was screaming at me to save him. \n\nI feel like I could sense the moment he had passed. The ambulance came within a few minutes but there was nothing they could do.\n\nHis mother came a few days later to apologise and thank us for trying to save him.

Pretty standard stuff in a high stress situation like that. \n\nOne day, though, in the middle of dinner, the other cook (my immediate manager, but not the restaurant manager) apparently just had a bad night. He'd been getting progressively more agitated all night (not with me, luckily). Suddenly, a waitress came back and complained that one of her tables was complaining because the food was cold. First, the manager responded by telling her that if she'd come get her orders when they were done, they wouldn't be cold, but when she made some comment back, he snapped.\n\nHe picked up a hot pan from the stove, and I was terrified for a second that he was going to throw it at her. Instead, he swung it at hard as he could at the entire stack of clean plates and knocked almost all of them off the table, shattering them on the floor. Then he literally tore off his apron and stormed out, but not before knocking a tray of full out of another watiress's hands.\n\nWeirdly enough, the store manager was going to let him keep his job if he'd admit being out of line. She brought him in during lunch the next day to talk to him, and instead of apologizing, he smashed a coffee cup against the wall and left.\n\nAll told, it was probably for the best.",

I'm going over time sheets and out of the corner of my eye I see him run to the trash can with what looked like some sort of brown liquid in his hands and casually toss it in. I'm under the assumption that he maybe spilled his lunch in the break room and was cleaning it up. I go to investigate the situation only to hear a loud lurch followed by a loud splat onto the floor. I find said employee holding an impressive amount of vomit in his hands and all over the break room is corn tortilla scented bile. I ask if he's ok and send him to first aid to make sure he's not dying. I glove up and begin the process of clean the chunky mess that he managed to spread across the break room and doors. I also find a nice trail of vomit leading to the trash can, and despite his best efforts, only managed to get his vomit onto the SIDE of the trash can. I just about finished cleaning the vomit and the employee comes back saying he 'usually feels better after a puke a lot'. I'm getting ready to send him home when, SURPRISE,  he decided he wasnt done puking. He looks me in the eyes and says 'i think I need a trashca-' and vomits all over the just mopped and sanitized floor. He then runs to the only hand washing sink and decided it would be great to puke in there. I send him home and spend the rest of my shift mopping and scooping chunks of hot water and vomit from a terribly clogged sink. Hey, I wanted to be the boss right? ",

Of course the lid came off and I was soaking wet. \n\nThe manager, who was actually pretty good as far as fast food managers go, saw this happen. He took off running into the parking lot, flagged down the driver before he could leave, and told him to never come back.

            "Here's a story. Keep in mind I was 17 year old girl while working at this hotel. I've never seen a naked person in the hallway. But once in the lobby a man at around 300am sat down on a chair and called his girlfriend. I was on the night shift and I was sitting down behind a computer screen so he would have only seen the top of my head if he looked over. But it was Sunday morning and he was extremely drunk from a wedding. He was wearing a suit and I was just keeping my eye on him. He then started having raunchy phone sex with his girlfriend or wife. And it was so raunchy. My jaw dropped and I honestly didn't know what to do. Then a janitor came over and we were sitting there flabbergasted. He then pulled his dick out and started jerking off. So I got up, walked over and said \"Sir, you're in the lobby.\" He woke up out of his sexual drunker stupor and I'll never forget the look of horror that came across his face. He ran to his room so embarrassed.",
            "Finally one I can answer!  I caught someone once. Well I didn't have to catch them. They came to me. \n\nI worked night audit at a local hotel. One night/ morning around 5am I was at the desk when the elevator started moving. At the time we didn't have cameras so I didn't know what to expect.  \n\nWhen it stopped in the lobby the doors opened and I see a man with a cart looking slightly shocked. Then from the blind spot from where I was standing out stepped a man with a cigarette in hand and nothing but a small towel around his waist.  He looked pissed. He stormed up to the desk and demanded a new room key. All while yelling about how he got lost in the \"confusing as fuck rooms.\" I confirmed his room best I could given the situation and sent him on his way. The poor man that was in the elevator with him looked like he saw more than I did and didn't want to talk about it. \n\nAn hour later the man came down to the lobby to check out and demanded a \"full refund for embarrassing him and for not clearly labelling the balcony door and the hallway door.' I laughed and told him to call my manager.  Which he did later that day. \n\nKicker is the room he was in had 2 doors. A bathroom door on one side of the room. And on the completely other side with a fire map, chain lock and dead bolt the room door. There was no balcony attached to his room.",

One day while I was doing rounds at 3 am, I thought I saw something moving at the opposite end of the hallway and I was like \"Did I just see a naked man?\". This poor guy was sleep walking butt naked while hugging himself (our hallways are freezing cold). I approached him closer and said \"Hello sir\"  He turned his head and said hey. I was like is he still asleep? Five seconds later, I guess he realized what was going on, he said \"I'm so sorry.\" I gave him a rob from a nearby housekeeping closet took him to the lobby to verify his identity (obviously he doesn't have ID on him). I gave him a room key and followed him back to his room to make sure he doesn't sleep on his way back or whatever.\n\nEdit: I can't stop laughing. Thank you all.  \nI am glad that I didn't send this story to my manager. Whether he reads it as if I rubbed a naked man in the hallway, pulled off a stick-up on a guy with his \u201cstick\u201d hanging out, or even worse as if I hid Mr. Rob in the closet so I could introduce him to a sleep walker, I would have been fired.",

A lot of tourists don't want to mess around with tourist sims and the local cellular networks, so they ask the front desk at hotels to call an Uber for them. The Uber gets to the hotel, and the guest pays the driver in cash. And yes, taxis are a lot easier.

            "Student Paramedic here.\nHad a call being general broadcasted over radio when I was chilling in base with my mentor (we were on a 2 man car ambulance) operator who was broadcasting said something along the lines of: \"female, reportedly unconscious, police on scene, major trauma (pause)... CPR in progress confirmed arrest by police on scene.\" \n\nmy mentor looks at me, we're off in 30 mins at the end of a night shift but we go anyway. We're around the corner. Make it there in no time at all. There's police EVERYWHERE. at least 7 squad cars. I'm nervous as hell and so is my mentor. As we approach the house, a man emerges, handcuffed by police. He looks content enough and smiles at us as we walk by. Police shout for us to hurry, we run over with equipment to front door and are met with one of the worst scenes I've ever seen and will always be there in my mind.\n\nThere's a woman lying on the ground, with the left side of her head caved in, blood absolutely all over the place and brain matter scattered around the floor too. Police are doing CPR, we stop them when we see the Patient has signs of pooling and rigor mortis. I'm literally sweating and on the verge of tears, this is not how I wanted my shift to end. Then, we hear from behind us more police in the house and the sounds of children. 2 kids are escorted out of a bedroom behind us with their eyes covered and one of them asks:\"what's going on Where's Mommy?\". My heart melted. I've never been exactly traumatised by a job but those kids being shielded from what just happened to their mother will stick with me forever. \n\nI bring equipment back to the ambulance as my mentor starts to do paperwork and we wait for someone to move the body.

I was waiting for a patient to return to their room, talking with her, when she looks down at her phone. She tells me she has the dispatch app or whatever for ambulances and fire trucks, and every firehall in the county had just received a call about a possible decomposing body. Apparently the neighbor called about a terrible smell coming from the property. Hazmat was called and everything, expecting a dead human body.\n\nOnce they broke into the house, they found that it wasn\u2019t a dead human, but 38 dogs in the house. 11 of the dogs were dead and in \u201cvarying states of decomposition\u201d.

The two people who owned the house have since been arrested and charged with 51 counts of animal cruelty.

Obvious throwaway because people know my personal account and I'm not ready to talk about it with most people; most details are intentionally made ambiguous. The irony that I'm posting it here for everyone is not lost on me.\n\n\nI was in Afghanistan in 2011, working in Humanitarian Assistance/Human Terrain Analysis. I was working in the southern part of a city in the southeast of the country, working in various villages/communities over the course of a few weeks. I have middle eastern/southwest asian features, so the Afghans took a liking to me. I got to know one village community particularly well, to the point that one of the younger boys (about 13) would always walk with me holding my hand (a sign of friendship in their culture). We'd talk about life in America, what his life was like in his Afghanistan, what he wanted to be when he grew up...basic shit, nothing serious. I left that community to work in other parts of the region for a little while with the intention of coming back for one more visit before I went back to HQ to write reports and shit. So I go back for that one visit to find the community cold to me, which is very unusual in Pashtunwali (Pashtuns is the ethnicity of the people in the area, Pashtunwali is like their ethnic \"code of conduct\"). As we're leaving the area, we found the body of the kid that was hanging out with me. He was executed by gunshot and left to rot in a ditch. He didn't die for me in the sense that he sacrificed himself for my sake. Rather, he died for being my friend. The people of that community refused to speak to any NATO forces after that.",

I used to work at an elementary school and one day during dismissal time, one of the parked school busses suddenly jumped the curb towards a group of children. The principal was not too far behind them and pushed them out of the way just in time, before the bus hit her and killed her instantly. \n\nI was there when it happened. That was the bravest and most selfless thing I have ever seen anyone do and proved her character in how passionate she was with working with children. ",

The genocide was basically between two tribes, Hutus and Tutsis, my parents were each from different tribes.

Not wanting my mom to die, my dad chose to bring us to her tribe's side of the conflict, thus sealing his own death in the process.

The guy threw an extension cord out to us, my dad told me to grab hold of it, and he pushed hard on me to get me up on the ice so the guy could pull me to shore.

            "I once went to a new hairdresser, this guy was really nice but he was firmly convinced that he could give my hair some nice curls and insisted that we tried it.\nThe thing is, I know my hair. It's thick, mid length, and tends to straighten itself due to the weight and thickness of it. And I don't mind, I like my hair, it's easy to take care of, soft, doesn't need a lot of work in the morning to look good. But I never could curl it, it just won't cooperate. \n\nSo this hairdresser who never took care of my hair before propose that we style them in a rather pretty way, with soft, natural curls. I tell him it won't work, many other hairdresser tried before. So he says: \"yeah, but I never did, and I'm sure I can, so let's try it\" I agreed, thinking what the hell, if he succeds good for me, if he fails it won't matter. \n\nSo for nearly an hour I watched the poor guy try to dry my hair in a hundred different ways to get those damned curls, only to end up with what looked like a stork's nest on my head (only much cleaner and softer). \n\nHe ended up more disappointed than me, he bore such a crushed look in his eyes upon realizing his defeat, while I was laughing my ass off at what I looked like . In the end I told him it didn't matter, really i didn't mind, in just half an hour my hair would return to its usual shape. So I paid him and left, he was so sorry he made me pay the short hair price. I went back a couple times since then, and I was happy with the result each time. ",
            "I definitely notice. My stomach immediately drops, and I feel a little upset that the guest doesn't like it, especially if it was a long service, but more disappointed in myself for not being the best stylist I could be. It's pretty easy to tell if they actually like it or not, because if they don't like it, they'll touch and pull on their hair more than usual, get up really close to the mirror to really inspect, and they take a minute to say anything to you instead of just looking in the mirror and being like, \"omg I love it, it looks great!\". Usually if I see that their not enthusiastic, I will inspect, ask questions, and try to fix it as best I can before they even leave. \"Are you sure that it's thinned out enough for you?\", \"Are you sure it's a good length?\", \"Those highlights are definitely gold instead of ash, let's mix up a different toner real quick.\" Usually asking those questions helps you fix the problem and the guest leaves happy. You definitely can't please everyone though, so if they're still not happy after I tried to fix it, I'll do a more thorough consultation the next time and talk to another stylist about my plan for their hair to make sure what I'm doing is correct, and if they still don't like it, I refer them to another stylist. \n\nEDIT: All introverts, don't stress so much! Believe me, we know the difference between someone quiet, but appreciative of their cut, and someone who straight up hates their hair! Another thing about the touching: people who are unhappy with their hair, tend to fixate on one or two certain spots of their hair, instead of just getting a feel for it or seeing different angles. Don't worry, we know the difference, but if you're still self-conscious just say something like, \"omg it feels so much better/healthier/whatever!\" while you run your hands through it! If you're one of those people who needs a few days to get used to your new style, send your stylist a selfie to show you really love it!

            "This story (copy and paste)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd here's where the expression \"Party like it's 1999\" comes in full force:\n\nHere I am, in my flat party, in England, 1999, someone threw a cigarette in my beer glass, I accidentally drink it, and I feel like I may have to barf. Both toilets are taken.\n\nI run from one floor down, outside the building, barf my ass off in the garden on the left, and when I come around I see the neighbor's window open. My neighbor who I know is at my party, and is living alone. And someone has opened his window and entered. I go near the window carefully and see some bloke with a travel bag picking off valuables, a Dreamcast, some electrical stuff...\n\nI run back to my flat party and tell everyone there's a burglar at the next house. People call the police, but by then drunk mob rule mentality is taking over. People pick up broom handles, another bloke picks up some heavy duty duct tape and some giant ass trash bags.\n\nThey all run across to the burgled house next door.\n\nThe burglar sees them, panics and tries to leave through the same window, but a couple of drunks intercept him and fall on him. The rest arrive, the guy with the broom handle hits him once or twice but not seriously, I doubt he even bruised him, but the point is the burglar's busted. He's so terrified of this drunken mob he doesn't even try to escape, he just lies down on the grass petrified.\n\nThen duct tape guy arrives. After some struggle we finally manage to tie his legs together, then his hands, then his arms, and in a fit of drunken stupor we get to fit the big ass trash bags around him and we wrap him up like a Christmas present, the only thing out of the pack of bags being his head. He looks like a huge ass cartoon caterpillar. Then we tie him up even more, with everything we got. Someone even brought scotch tape and wrapped it around him just for kicks. The dude, being pretty tall but thin and untrained as hell, is just sitting there, mumbling in shock to be let go and that he won't come back again.\n\nWe all start cheering up again when another guy has the fantastic notion to go to the all-nighter supermarket and buy a pack of rubber bands to wrap around caterburglar, and we wait for him for about ten minutes, starting to sober up.\n\nThe police are still nowhere in sight.\n\nThe guy who went to the supermarket returns not with rubber bands but with some pretty heavy rope.\n\nHere is where I go up to my room to see if everything was all right, and when I return I see the rest of the party people having tied and raising the burglar upside down by his feet on a lamp post like a pinata.\n\nWe kept him hanging there for about twenty minutes before the police arrived. By the time they arrived we had turned the speakers towards the street and were partying around the human caterpillar. I think somebody offered the dude some beer, but he couldn't drink it upside down.\n\n-editing in the police officers' reaction like a ninja boss- They asked us to turn the music down, which we did after a minute or two. There wasn't a problem with the noise because the neighbors were glad we caught a burglar and besides the street dancing and laughing we were quite peaceful. I remember one old neighbor opening her window to tell us to keep the noise down, but as soon as she saw what was going on outside and we explained who the human caterpillar was, she burst in a fit of laughter and went back inside.\n\nI remember all the cops leaving with big ass smiles all over their faces, we all knew they were desperately trying to appear serious so we cut them some slack and provided them with all the info we could as soon as possible. Of course they politely refused our offers of beer, but since everyone was over 18 we didn't do anything to warrant anything other then harsh finger pointing, vigilantism is a dangerous and unlawful game etc. One drunk said \"then it's good I didn't dress as Batman like I planned\" and we just about all died on the spot.\n\nThey approached the burglar smiling at the spectacle, asked the guys to get him down from the lamp post, this huge Greek called Peter took him on his shoulder like you'd carry a rolled up carpet and carefully placed him inside the police car. They left with the guy still in caterburglar costume.\n\ntl;dr caught a burglar and tied him like a caterpillar on a lamp post until the police arrived, partied all around him. May he turn into a beautiful jail butterfly.\n\n",

He was there for me through so much and was a wonderful friend.\n\nHe had a new girlfriend at the time of our meet-up and he brought her along with him. I had no problem with this, because I'd love to meet the woman who makes him happy.\n\nIt was abundantly clear from the get go that she wasn't a real big fan of me. I did my best to be kind, and still had tons of fun. \n\nI didn't hear from my friend much after that. A mutual good friend of ours messaged me and when I asked about my best friend, they said that his girlfriend was telling people that I was basically an awful person for whatever reason. \n\nThree years later and he is engaged to this woman and I'm happy for him, but I haven't spoken to him in those three years.

I think I had a friend over or coming over, and I forgot to mute my mic and said the road he lived on, asking when he had to leave/come over (again this was 15 yrs ago, a little fuzzy).

            "Any change in behaviour. Usually personal hygiene, attendance, level of interaction. But honestly, as a once extremely suicidal grad student, it was surprising how little people noticed. I showed up for work for barely 4-5 hours, I was quite a bit withdrawn, but I also over-compensated : sometimes I\u2019d make an effort to dress nicely, be more cheerful because I didn\u2019t want any one to see what was really going on. I\u2019d hang around till almost midnight to make up for lost hours. Depressed behaviour is often contradictory. There\u2019s no one way to predict - some people withdraw, some people throw themselves into things further in an effort to distract. You are seeing them for a few hours a day, it is hard to tell what\u2019s going in their life. That\u2019s why any change from baseline is important doesn\u2019t matter which direction it moves in. For me, it didn\u2019t end well. I\u2019m still alive and I suppose that\u2019s good. ",

            "You can tell by changes in attitudes, participation, and grades. These aren\u2019t the only indicators, but they are the ones I key off of for my students.\n\nAll you can do is make yourself available. There are certain things we are required to report, but all of my students know that if they are having an issue, my door is open, and confidential unless it is a mandatory reporting issue. I am up front with them that there are some things I have to pass along because I don\u2019t want to betray their trust.\n\nWhen students do come to me with concerns, I let them talk. A lot of the time, there isn\u2019t much I can actually do, other than be a sounding board for them. I\u2019ll make suggestions after they are done if I think they would benefit from speaking to a councilor or give advise if they want it.\n\nI always ask for non reporting issues if they would like me to inform their other teachers so they know what is going on, and if they say no it stops with me. If they say yes, it is usually because they are not comfortable bringing it up themselves.\n\nEven if students don\u2019t say anything, as a group we let each other know if we notice something is off.

            "Not a teacher, but I was a student going through this. I was in a small town with virtually no mental health resources. I was lucky enough to have a few teachers see what I was going through, and cut me a bit of slack after watching me go through DHR battles with heavy abuse at home. I went from being a model student with straight A\u2019s to someone who showed up when I wanted with no work to turn in. \n\nOne teacher in particular started inviting me to dinner, and she requested me as her student aide during my free periods. She would ask me how my home life was, and if things were bad she\u2019d plan sleep overs with her daughter who I\u2019d become close friends with. She made me feel like I was welcome in at least one spot in my life. She and her daughter made me feel loved when I wasn\u2019t at home. She probably saved my life in high school. \n\nThanks Mrs. G. ",
            "I\u2019ve been teaching high school for 13 years. In that time, we\u2019ve lost about a student a year on average, and about half of those have been suicides. After one particularly impactful student\u2019s passing, I made it my personal mission to form a personal connection with every one of my students. \n\nYou can tell a student is going through depression or self-loathing the same way you\u2019re able to tell when a friend of yours is going through those same feelings - students are people, after all. Oftentimes, attendance drops, attention to self-care tapers off, and they start to withdraw. They\u2019ll stop raising their hand and doing their assignments and sleep through class more and more. When that happens, I try to pull kids aside and say, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve noticed that you seem like you\u2019re going through something. You\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m here for you and I care about you.\u201d Some kids will deny anything is going on, some will burst into tears and reach out for a hug, some will set an appointment to come in and talk later. I also let them know about the support groups we have on campus and ask if they\u2019re interested. Sometimes I call home, sometimes I don\u2019t - I feel out the situation and decide from there. I\u2019ll also try to put that student in a group with my more mature students. Not the overly positive ones, but the most level-headed just so that there\u2019s some consistency in their life. \n\nMost importantly, I try to say every single one of my students\u2019 names every day in a positive way. I want to talk to every single kid every single period, even if it\u2019s just a \u201chey, I love your new shoes!\u201d I pay special attention to the kids I know are going through something. It\u2019s a delicate balance - I want them to know that I am paying special attention to them, but I don\u2019t want everyone else to know that I\u2019m doing anything different. So acknowledging all kids this way allows me to spend just a minute or two longer with the ones who really need it without them getting labeled as teacher\u2019s pets. \n\nThis part of my job is by far the hardest. I wish I could unburden my kiddos. \ud83d\ude15",
            "My (general ed psychology) professor is some fancy head of the Psychology department in our school. She handed around fliers/papers to our college's Student Health Center, and spent about 30 minutes talking to all \\~100 of us in our huge lecture hall about mental health. She mentioned the procedures, such as how it's basically like asking for advice, and it's not a scary place. She mentioned how \"when you get sick, you don't say you're *diseased*.\" \"When you break your finger, you don't call yourself *disabled*.\" \"When you go to your doctor for a check-up, you're not always sick, sometimes you're just getting checked in.\" She mentioned how seeking mental help, OR seeking mental evaluation can both just be that - mental \"check ups\" for yourself. And, for those who felt guilty about their mental illness, it doesn't mean to negatively generalize your whole self as negatively \"ill\" or \"broken.\" She basically made everyone feel human, and sometimes our brain, head, or body gets sick sometimes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe kept mentioning how our college's mental health services are all free if you're a student. And how everyone in that room qualifies for it. She asked everyone, \"who's interested in going?\" and \"Who plans to go?\" and few students raised their hands in relief. I was already debating to go because of my mental struggles, but hesitated every time I passed by that Student Health area for about a year. The paper she gave us mentioned how we can call or just walk in. The paper even mentioned how it doesn't have to be about stress, just about how to help shape us for healthier mental lives. It mentioned confidentiality, and a place where one doesn't have to feel ashamed of their illness or struggles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis happened about a week ago, so I'm still a little emotional by writing this, so my words might be a little everywhere. Either way, I'm still too afraid to go to the health building in person, but I have been seeking professional online resources/support now. It's a small step, and I know people have to push themselves to get better (like still getting a shot, despite being afraid), but just hearing this professor open arms and remove some fears really relieved some doubts and fear about seeking help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSmall Edit: She also made a big deal about always asking and seeking for help, despite if it's asking a teacher, manager, boss, parent, friend, etc. until you get help. She said to keep seeking until you get the help you need. I have high respect for her. One thing I would personally add, is to keep note of things that do and don't work. If a parent helping you isn't enough, take note of that. Seek/ask more. If a teacher isn't helping, seek/ask more (possibly a professional). If a specific professional doesn't help, seek a different one/type. It almost feels like an endless search, but I believe one has to make a huge deal about seeking help, because you *are* a big deal.",
            "This will probably get buried, but I was actually dealing with this today. I have had a freshman (14-15 years old) in my class all year that is super quiet and withdrawn most of the time, but occasionally will contribute the most insightful, well-thought-out, knowledgeable responses in class. He clearly understands the content, but spends 3/4 of the class sleeping or tuning out. \n\nEarly on, I noticed that he was clearly bright but not engaging, so I continued to check in with him. He mostly stayed withdrawn, and when I asked him what was going on, he would just shrug. I reached out to home and received no response, and continued checking in with him one on one getting the same shrug. \n\nThis past week were parent teacher conferences, and he came in by himself (which a lot of kids end up doing due to parent work schedules). We chatted again, and when I asked him how he was doing, he said, \"Well...you remember what it was like to be 15,\" which was the most detailed response I had gotten from him. I told him I had and shared that I had gone through some pretty severed anxiety and depression and didn't receive help until my 20s, and that I wish I had reached out sooner. I then shared with him that we have counseling services on our campus and asked if he wanted me to make an appointment for him, and he said ok, which honestly feels like a huge victory.\n\nI try to get to know each of my kids, and the biggest way I do that is simply by asking them how they are doing each day. May simply respond with, \"fine,\" but occasionally they will offer something more vulnerable. I guess to really respond to your question, I look for what I know and remember, and I try to support them the best I can.\n\n\nEDIT: HOLY SHIT THIS BLEW UP! I literally wrote this in an exhausted haze after 3 LONG days of conferences (peaking at 12 hours) and passed out afterwards. I really didn't think anyone would see it. Thank you all, internet strangers, for the kind words and encouragement. This interaction is unfortunately par for the course for a lot of educators, and most of the teachers I know would respond the same way, but it is nice to get some recognition every once in a while.\n\nYoung people who have commented that you wish you had someone in your life like me--now you do. Please feel free to reach out if you need help. Additionally, look for the kind faces at your school. I hope you are able to find the support you need.\n\nLast but not least: THANKS FOR THE GOLD AND SILVER KIND STRANGERS! I have now lost my bling virginity.  ",
            "It's often hard to tell, and even when we suspect something, it's hard to do anything that will actually help.  This semester I see 126 different students over the course of a typical day.  As much as I'd like to, it's simply not possible for me to get to know all of my students on anything close to a personal level.  I can't be on the lookout for changes in students' behavior if I don't know what their normal behavior is.  My school identifies certain students at being \"at risk,\" based on home life, grades, etc., and assigns each teacher two of those students to mentor.  I try to check in regularly with my mentees, as well as any student who seems to be acting differently.  Of course, depression doesn't just strike the type of person my school labels \"at risk.\"  \n\nEven if I notice that something seems off about a student (quiet when they're usually loud, loud when they're usually quiet, avoiding usual friends, unusual amount of missing work, etc), there isn't always much I can do.  Depressed people don't want others to know they are depressed.  My typical strategy is to quietly pull the student aside and just ask how they are doing.  I've gotten everything from \"Great!  No problems here!\" to \"My step dad called me a worthless piece of shit this morning, and my ex-girlfriend is pregnant but she isn't sure if it's mine, and I'm failing four classes so I'm afraid I won't graduate, and I think you're about to send me to the principal because I have chewing tobacco in my mouth.\"  If nothing else I try to be a listening ear.  Many of my students don't really have that.  The counselors at my school are actually pretty good at helping struggling kids, so if someone needs to talk but doesn't want to talk to me I put them in touch with their counselor.\n\nIf a student says they are fine, but I think they might be struggling with depression or something related, I'll reach out to their other teachers, their coaches, and the school counselor to relay my concerns.  We'll keep a close eye on the student, but we can't do much else without anything concrete.  I've reached out to parents before if I have serious concerns."

Had to read a little between the lines in some slightly later entries as they were written with such flowery language. In one such entry, all of a sudden she discloses that she's had an abortion.

He ate mushrooms... Like, what...portabellas??\"\n\nShe grew up very sheltered in the country. So that's how this was gonna go.\n\nWe get there and the cops walk out a skinny kid wearing only boxers. Took some shrooms, first time ever, freaked out and told his parents who called 911. My partner is spinning in circles and asking whether she should call poison control.\n\nI help the kid into the ambulance and onto the stretcher, turn the lights down low and tell my partner just to drive to the hospital. The kid is calming down a bit but he's tripping pretty hard. Asking if his parents are Jesus and stuff like that.\n\nThis was before smart phones when iPods were the shit. I had one of those radio transmitters you could plug into the iPod and then play music through the vehicle speakers. It had a remote that I carried on my belt along with the clicker for the ambulance.\n\nWe were going to the hospital, lights down low, just being chill when I remembered what my partner and I had been listening to a couple hours before when we checked our equipment. [Thievery Corporation.](https://youtu.be/uN9tulBHr8Y) So I reached down and hit the remote without him noticing. A few seconds go by and he turns to me with the widest eyes I've ever seen. \"Whoa. What... Is... This... Music?\" He was in true bliss. He kept asking me about the music for the rest of the ride. \n\nWe dropped him off and I wrote \"Listen to Thievery Corporation\" on a sheet of paper and tucked it into the waistband of his boxers. I like to think there's some dude out there from upstate New York who fell in love with Thievery in high school but doesn't really know why.\n\nEDIT: YEAH!!

We don\u2019t know exactly when they decided to take the LSD. \n\nSo they\u2019re brought in to the ED for an eval before they\u2019re let go. This being rural NC, no one had a clue about how to handle this type of situation. We basically gave them IV fluids, put them on cardiac monitors, and tried not to stimulate them too much. They were extremely polite, and since I was the closest in age to them and had some experience with recreational drugs, I did my best to engage them. As I was starting an IV on the male partner, I asked how he was feeling. \u201cVery safe,\u201d he replied. His pupils were as wide as saucers. I miss that job sometimes.",

Due to being unable to catch him, they called for dog-squad backup. He recounted with a shit-eating grin how he\u2019d hidden inside a giant puddle \u2018like Rambo\u2019 and had thrown sticks and rocks to confuse the police dog. Following an hour or so, they gave up and reverted to using a search line of ~12 police slowly advancing to find him. Eventually one stumbled into this goblin\u2019s little swamp puddle, and then they took another 15 minutes trying to catch him as he bolted naked around the children\u2019s playground...again.\n\nHis only regret, despite his wife refusing to come and pick him up from the hospital, was that he hadn\u2019t eaten more shrooms.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m glad this story is brightening a few days.

They knew who I was and they knew that I would be able to recognize them, as I had delivered a few orders to them before.

Do you still talk to your family? \n\nSome of them - I talk to all of my siblings and am very close to the sister who was with me at the event. She and I very rarely discuss this though. \n\n5. Where are you now mentally? \n\nI am doing MUCH better and live half a country away. I still have PTSD from the events as well as the other abuse from my mom/other events in my life. \n\n6.

It's usually sweet and makes everybody in the room all fuzzy and warm.\n\nThis one guy wanted to take it further and requested to perform a song \u2014 he brought his own music and everything. We're pretty easy going at this job, so we agree to let him do it.\n\nWe do the fake draw, the woman comes up on stage infront of a room of 400 people, and the music starts to play. Apparently this guy was a little nervous, and he compensated by having a few drinks. So what follows is a slurred performance of a song written by this guy, that seemed to focus on how he was sorry for cheating on this woman *with her sister* and at the end of it, he gets down on one knee and proposes. Usually this gets a round of applause, encouraging the person to say yes; but not after that trainwreck of a performance. The poor woman was just holding her face the entire time and starts shaking her head and says \"No, what's wrong with you?\" She storms off and leaves him and our stage manager on stage to a bunch of murmuring from the audience. The only thing our stage manager can think of to say on mic is \"Well, that's that.\"\n\nThe guy ended up staying for the rest of the show and had many more drinks.

You never know. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt finally hit me that something wasn't right was when she wouldn't stop making sexual comments about the two (which is how I knew it was kind of a date). I am talking straight up things like \"I am 53 but with the amount of work I have had done to my downstairs, he won't be able to tell tonight if I am actually 23\" I am watching the mans face and he looks pained. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI watch the table from afar. I realize it kind of looks like a date gone wrong, but they seemed to know each other so I am not really sure what is going on (and servers always chat and theorize about their customers in their free-time) when the man gets up and comes over to me and asks me to chat with him around the corner really discretely. So I do. He looks as me and is talking super fast as he explains that this is his boss and he has to meet with her quarterly and she just has to sign a single form to approve what he has been doing and she insists on going out for a meal and drinking and then trying to sleep with him.

We made a code sign (him patting the back of his head three times) so that I could intervene when she would get far too inappropriate but honestly she didn't change much when I would come. He also asked me to bring him fake alcoholic beverages, said I could charge him for the alcohol but to make them water or just soda. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still think about him sometimes and wish I had gotten his name or something so I could check in and encourage him to report her, but in all honesty she probably owned the comany he worked for or something the way she spent money and looked like. \n\n&#x200B;",

One person is 'it' and the others hide\n\nThe person who is it roams around trying to find people but they need not touch anyone, they just need to identify them (hence it needing to be after dark).  So if i was found or being chased the person who is it just needs to yell \"Big T go to the barnyard!\" And i would be caught.  I would then go to the barnyard (a predetermined place that is a jail of sorts).  Goal for the person who is it is to get everyone to the barnyard, but everyone hiding can also free the people caught by getting into the barnyard and yelling \"the cows ars loose!\"\n\nFuckin game was epic. But also dangerous, because some of the games featured hiding on top of 100ft silos, or in an actual barn with 800lbs cows \n\nOnly tough part about this game is it can be pretty open to cheating if youre not with honest people.

            "City council hired another medic. Older dude with long hair, not that that matters. He was new to the scene recently completing the course. \n\nGuy why awesome to hang out with. Went to the bar with the younger emts, played video games, etc. \n\nAt first I thought he was cool but as I observed his work (I was his superior and did his probationary eval) I noticed something was off. \n\nAt the private council meeting I spoke openly about this in his 30 day review. I stated something was off. He didn't seem like a people person and generally the type that would do this job. \n\nThey said that I had no grounds to state that he wasn't suited and that he did his job as described. \n\nI countered with the fact that when caring for people being a people person is an unwritten rule and that doing your job without caring leads to mistakes, and in our job field a mistake means death. \n\nThey weren't having it so I finally said \"look in this job field you need to learn to read people and in telling you that something isn't right here\"\n\nCity council told me that basically I was jealous because he got along with the emts. Honestly I could careless, I'm not in this job for them. \n\nFast forward a month and I get a call from an er about an hour from us. They said that their report said the patient was administered 80mg of drug x.  The patient denied receiving it and since they couldn't figure out wtf the medic would have even given it they ran a tox panel on him which showed that he did not receive it. \n\nThe doc told me normally he'd let it slide as an error and ask me to speak to him about accuracy, but he felt something was off. \n\nI thanked him and after hanging up pulled the trip sheets. Right in the run report it has the drug, the amount given, and the time. \n\nI pulled up the narcotics log. It showed drug given and replenished along with the tag numbers. \n\nNext I called a friend of mine who is a local cop and was off duty at the time. He came over and I opened the other medics narc box. Sure enough it had been opened and replaced. \n\nWe then went through his logs for the past 2 months he had been working and located at least 12 times drugs had been given when probably not needed. \n\nI called the er doc back and explained to him and his exact quote \"here's my personal phone number and our lawyers number. I'll fax you over a written statement along with the test results.  I'll see if we have anything on other patients he brought in\"\n\nMy buddy then called dispatch to tell the council members there was an emergency at the station and they need to come in. \n\nWhen they got there we showed them all the evidence and what we suspected. Within 15 minutes we not only had the da approval but also a judge sign an arrest warrant. \n\nTurns out the dude admitted to having a 20 year pain killer addiction that he ran out of sources so he figured being a medic would give him easy access. He even told the judge he was worried that he would have killed someone just for the meds. \n\nAt the trial I was asked for what resolution I wanted. I told the judge being a paramedic I've seen how drugs change a person and that I don't hold him fully responsible. On my recommendation he got 3 months in a locked drug rehab facility followed by 6 months of house arrest. \n\n4 years later the dude is clean and runs a fund raiser to help raise money for the end to provide anonymous narcan services and drug awareness programs. \n\nToday this guy would be an honored member of my crew. Addiction literally changes people. \n\nThe end result is I now am solely responsible for hiring the medics, reviewing, and dismissal. I no longer need to justify to council why someone was dismissed. This job is one where a gut feeling decides someone's fate. ",

People tried to avoid sitting next to her.  We all gossiped about her as being the epitome of creepiness. \n\nThen one day she was gone.   Didn't come to class. \n\nThe next day, it was all over the news:   the police had arrested these horrifically abusive parents, who were neglecting and abusing their daughter, and who had kept their younger son locked in a cage *his entire life.*  And never fed him.  The younger boy was kept alive by--you guessed it-- his older sister.   The police were led to the house by neighbors' complaints about the stench.  \n\nSo this poor, smelly girl was suffering abuse from her parents, and all the while sneaking food and water to her little brother--who was *literally locked in a cage* for years upon years... keeping him alive-- and then coming to school, where she would be avoided and mocked behind her back and sometimes humiliated. \n\nShe was a weirdo, and our \"guts\" all told us there was something wrong there. \n\nBut she was a fucking hero.   \n\n(never heard what happened to her after the parents were arrested.  hope she recovered.)

But I always sensed something shady about the guy. When I was in the 5th grade, I remember getting in huge trouble for a class assignment--an essay describing our families--in which I described him as a bad person--pretty much word for word, \"there's something I just don't like about him.\" It was one of the only times I got spanked as a child. \n\nWell, fast forward a couple years, and my parents discovered that he'd been abusive to my sister and the kids almost the whole time. They ended up divorcing, and he has proven to be a complete sociopath ever since. He hadn't paid a dime in child support, despite being well off enough to buy a new luxury sports car every few years, and uses their two kids (who are now teenagers who know he's full of shit) to play mind games with my sister--bringing her to court for full custody, knowing he won't win due to his past, just to cause her inconvenience and rack up legal fees for her, just as an example. He also has refused to let the kids fly out to visit our side of the family a few times for no reason whatsoever.

            "So my husband has this cousin, Jason.  And he fucking loathes him.  Always has since he was a small child.  There are stories about my husband trying to beat Jason's ass when he they were five. It was so bad, that as an adult my husband refused to attended any family gatherings that Jason would be at out of the fear that he would beat the living shit out of him.  \n\nNobody could ever figure out why my husband hated his cousin so much.  He had never done anything to him.  And my husband is the most laid back and friendly person I have ever met. He genuinely likes everyone, except for this motherfucker.  I never understood it myself, never having met Jason, and anytime I would ask my husband about it he would always says, \"I fucking hate that kid.  He's not right.\"   Jason was pretty well liked throughout the family so my husband's position caused him to catch a lot of shit from other family members.  \n\nI finally got to meet Jason a few years ago at my brother in law's wedding.  And I saw right fucking off what my husband was talking about.  To the casual observer there was nothing tangible that Jason DID that you could put your finger on.  But something was off.  He would laugh and smile but the smile didn't go all the way to his eyes.  His eyes were just flat and empty.  Unless he was looking at the girls at the wedding.  And when I say girls I mean children under 10.  When he looked at those girls his eyes lit up with this sick little light.  You know how someone who hasn't eaten in a long time looks when the finally get a meal they love set in front of them?  That's how Jason's eyes looked when he looked at those little girls, like he was hungry and they were his meal.  \n\n\nAbout two years ago Jason's dad married a woman with two young daughters.  Jason would often volunteer to babysit.  About a year ago Jason was arrested and convicted of raping both those little girls multiple times.  \n\nFuck you Jason.  I wish my husband had beat your ass you creepy fuck. "

            "There is no \"Skip all the floors\" button combination on any elevator you're going to be in, and even if there is one there's no way you'll find it.\n\nI'm an elevator lover, and I have family in the elevator repair business, so I've spent a lot of time listening to elevator stories, and doing my own research. All those pictures and posts about how if you \"Hold the buttan and the close door button you skip the calls\" are all lies, especially the ones that say it's for emergency services. Emergency services that would realistically need this kind of control over an elevator have keys to turn the elevator into fire mode, which does indeed skip all floor calls.\n\nIf a building owner wanted an elevator to be able to ignore calls without fire emergency operation mode, there's another way. Called Independent Service mode, sometimes called \"Operator's service\" like the old time elevator operator who sat in the elevator and drove it all day. Independent Service is also usually key activated, though It could be activated through a button at the front desk, on a computer, or in the controller room at the top of the shaft manually. In 30 years of elevator installation and repair, my uncle says he has never once seen an elevator that had a button combination set up to do anything like that without first inserting an operators key. The only exception being in hospitals freight elevators, which usually have a \"code blue\" button on the inside panel and the outside call buttons, but those are usually employee access only, and there is an understanding in a hospital that you don't just hit that button for no reason. \n\nEDIT: This blew up and everyone wants to know about the close door buttons. The short answer is sometimes they work. The long answer, is that is depends entirely on what the building owner wanted, and what the installer did. Not all elevator models will have those buttons wired in at all, of those that do, many of them don't do anything for normal operation but are integral to the function of Independent Service mode and some of them will tell the controller to shorten the time the doors are waiting open during normal operation. Any elevator can be set up do do almost anything the owner wants, limited only by the skill of the elevator guy, and the laws of physics. I've seen elevators that will calculate the number of people on board based on weight, and then automatically cancel buttons when people try to press more buttons than there are people on board.\n\nEdit 2: Some people also want to know about floor cancelling by double tapping/long pressing a button. The basic reason this doesn't exist is Laziness mainly. It takes time and effort to set up an elevator to do that, so unless an owner asks his elevator guy to set it up like that, it's just not gonna get done. Elevator techs will also bill for the time it takes to set this up, so an owner may decide that messing up the floors on an elevator happens rarely enough that it doesn't justify the cost to set it up, since even when it does happen the building owner will rarely receive kickback so he has no incentive to implement the feature. That being said, It does come as a standard pre programmed option on some newer elevator controllers so you will see this feature a lot in the wild, with increasing frequency as more and more building owner decide it's worth the cost to update their elevators, or outright buy new elevators for a new building.",

            "The Lake Peigneur Disaster.\n\nUntil 1980, Lake Peigneur was a small-ish freshwater lake with a maximum depth of about 10-15ft, located in southern Louisiana.  Locals mostly used it for trout fishing, and it also had a canal running 10 miles from the lake southward to the Gulf of Mexico.  The main industry of the area was a massive salt mine that stood below the ground, partially underneath the lake itself.  Thing is, huge natural salt deposits like this often coincide with oil reserves, so it wasn't out of the ordinary when oil companies came searching.\n\nIn November of 1980, Texaco had set up a rig in the lake and was doing some exploratory drilling, hoping to make bank.  Little did they know that one of their triangulation coordinates was slightly off, and so they had incorrectly guessed the location of the salt mine below their feet.  Their drill bit punched into the roof of the salt deposit about 400 feet earlier than expected, and water began to drain slowly into the salt.\n\nAnd what happens when salt meets water?\n\nIt dissolves.\n\nAs the water dissolved more and more salt, it made more and more room for water to be sucked down, which in turn dissolved more salt and made more room, setting off a massive chain reaction.  The oil rig on the surface keeled to the side and collapsed, its workers barely escaping before the water pressure became too much to swim through.  The remnants of the rig were sucked into the bottom of the lake in what had turned from a tiny hole to a whirlpool, the force of the water shearing away soil and making a bigger hole as it went.\n\nThe salt mine at the time was fully staffed with workers 1500ft below the ground, who were going about their daily shifts in the mine without any knowledge of the events taking place above them, until they saw water dripping through the roof of the tunnels.  Thanks to well-rehearsed evacuation plans, none of them died before the mine was flooded, but water is just about the worst thing you can see in a salt mine.\n\nThe whirlpool on the surface, having eaten the rig, began to suck down the entire contents of the lake itself, including 11 barges, various small boats, and yes, the poor trout.  The whirlpool grew into a maelstrom, its pressure increasing and in turn building more pressure by creating a bigger and bigger hole, eroding more and more of the salt mine.  As it pulled down the entire lake, the water began to shear away at the shores, creating landslides and tearing trees out by the roots.  Many of Jefferson Island's 100-year-old pecan trees were lost to the maelstrom, along with several local homes that sat on the shore of the lake and were ripped out by the foundation.  The local botanical gardens was destroyed entirely as the soil underneath it was eroded in the span of only a few hours.\n\nCompressed air inside the mine finally exploded out through the mine shafts, quickly followed by a 400-foot geyser erupting from the mine's entrance.\n\nNot only did Lake Peigneur drain entirely into the mine, dragging 64 acres of destroyed land with it, but the pressure was so great that it also reversed the direction of the Delcambre Canal.  The ocean water from the Gulf of Mexico rushed northward through the canal to fill the Peigneur basin, temporarily creating the largest waterfall in Louisiana.\n\nThe chaos didn't end until the pressure equalized about a week later.  When things had finally calmed down, the lake had changed drastically.  Its maximum depth was now about 200feet, as opposed to its previous 10.  Its shoreline had expanded, chimneys sticking straight out of the water where houses had once been.  Nine out of the eleven barges claimed by the maelstrom floated back to the surface, although two remain somewhere in the ground below.  The botanical gardens were gone, and many of the local trees.  The salt mine was temporarily shut down, and although it did reopen it was finally closed permanently in 1986.  Texaco had to pay $32 million to the salt company, and a further $13 million to the gardens.  Miraculously, the only casualties of the disaster were the trout.\n\nThe most important difference, however, is that today Lake Peigneur is now a saltwater lake with ocean species, ten miles away from the ocean itself.\n\nAll caused by some bad numbers and a fourteen-inch drill bit.",

This was because the Japanese thought American submarines could only reach a much shallower depth than they actually could , and they never set their depth charges to these deeper depths. Congressman Andrew May decided it would be a good idea to hold a press conference announcing this fact. From then on the Japanese set their depth charges to these deeper depths. \"Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, commander of the U.S. submarine fleet in the Pacific, estimated that May's security breach cost the United States Navy as many as ten submarines and 800 crewmen killed in action.

This library somehow survived the Burning of Moscow in 1493 and continued to be passed down to her son, Vasili III, and then on to her grandson, Ivan IV.\n\nDuring Ivan IV's reign of terror (the second half of his reign), he feared the library was too precious a treasure and worried it would be stolen. So he and a few men took the collection out of Moscow (what was most likely a 1-3 day horse ride) and buried the books (possibly in a vault???) To ensure the location of the library would never get out, he had the men killed.\n\nIvan IV died before the location of the library was ever revealed.\n\nWe have no idea what could have been in this library or if the contents have even survived.

Gross stuff below:\n\nThey were often missing teeth so when they drank tea they would shove a chunk of maple sugar in their teeth gaps and drink tea through it. When the tea was done they would remove the sugar chunk, wrap it up and save it for later. \n\nThe number one cause of death for a Voyageur was complications of hernia because they carried heavy cargo on their backs. The average sack was 90 pounds and they would make a contest out of who could carry the most. Often 3 and for the show offs 4 packs. That's 360 pounds of cargo so of course guts would herniate. They would tie their sashes as tight as possible around their stomach to keep all their internal organs in place. \n\nSince they tried to keep limited supplies so they could carry the most cargo they would often use their toques as bowls. They would wax the yarn to waterproof the hats. So they would eat out of their hat that had hair, sweat, skin and probably bugs in it. \n\nThey didn't pull over to the shore to go to the bathroom. When you had to go you would go over the side of the canoe. This applies for both number ones and number twos. So if you had to shit you were shitting in front of the rest of your crew.\n\nTheir hygiene was awful. They often would not bathe or clean themselves up as it protected their skin from bugs and the sun. When they got close to a rendezvous point they would somewhat attempt to shave and clean themselves up. \n\nThey made do with what they had but learning about them has made me appreciate modern amenities like showers, toilets, access to health and dental care. \n\nEdit: holy crap I got gold! I know this is cliche but thank you! Here's some quick fun voyageur facts as a thank you: they paddled about 50 strokes per minute and the person who could carry a tune and played the fiddle were paid the best. They used music to keep pace and move faster. In Canada there were two main fur trade companies, Hudson bay company and northwest company. Those two companies hated each other and would get in fights all the time. Turf wars were a real thing. They were often under 5 foot 7 because having tall people in the canoe made it difficult and it was harder work for tall people because it took more effort to swing the paddle down. And lastly this song was their jam. It's about when they die they want to be buried with all the wine and their head under a tap. Gross party animals to the end! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/Lwb8mUb3hu8",

Many don't know, but shivering causes you to expend a lot of calories.\n\n*A sharp hunting/camping knife* - Many uses from cutting, opening things, working with rope, etc.\n\n*Maps* - If the internet/GPS goes down, these are invaluable in knowing where you are and where you can go.",
            "Bit of a \"prepper\" nut, so here's some of mine in order of importance:\n\n1. [Water](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/drinking/creating-storing-emergency-water-supply.html) \\- others have covered this so I'll be brief. You can't live long without water, you need to stay clean as well as hydrated, and don't forget your pets!\n2. Light - Candles are cool, and having some emergency candles is a good idea, but they should be a last resort. Fire is dangerous. LED technology has advanced to the point where even tiny pocket flashlights can run for days or weeks on a AAA battery. I like the [30 Day Lantern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ3doFWGK5s) for my at-home kit. I carry a tiny [Maratac flashlight](https://countycomm.com/collections/aaa-flashlights/products/aluminium-anodized-aaa-flashlight-by-maratac-rev-3) in my pocket all the time.\n3. Fire - So fire is dangerous, but you might need it to cook or make heat in a pinch. Buy a decent firesteel and learn how to use it. Dryer lint makes a good firestarter, and takes sparks readily. Keep some matches around the house. Be very, very careful with any type of indoor fire - don't make your emergency situation worse.\n4. Food - Eventually you'll need to eat. Find something shelf-stable that lasts, has enough nutrients (esp protein), and fits any dietary requirements you might have. CLIF bars can work in a pinch for something portable. Don't forget your pets! Edit: Yes, I meant \"don't forget **food for** your pets\". Yes, I deserve the smart remarks.\n5. Warmth - if it's cold, or might get cold, you need a way to stay warm that won't weigh you down. Merino wool hoodie / sweatshirt is great for this. Wool longjohns are also good. Think layers, so you can adjust as the temperature adjusts. You don't want to sweat when it's cold, and you don't want to overheat, either. Ye olde Space Blanket (mylar tarp) is also a go-to here, but they can tear easily.\n6. Dry - Staying dry is always important. Have a solid poncho or rain shell handy. Make sure you can put on fresh socks when you need to. Have some tarp and duct tape around in case you need to shore up a leak somewhere. Pay attention to flood warnings or severe storm / tropical storm warnings, especially if your area is flood-prone, and get to high ground before the water comes.\n7. Juice - batteries. Rechargables are good for the planet and safe for most electronics nowadays. The [Eneloop](https://www.panasonic.com/global/consumer/battery/eneloop.html) batteries by Panasonic are well-thought-of, and I've used them for years with no failures.

        "bestcomment": [
            "A guy I used to work with knew someone that worked on the show, so I've been to a few tapings as a customer. It's not staged, but it's 'massaged', like I imagine most reality TV shows are. You make a reservation through the production company and show up at your allotted time, sign a release, and sit down and eat a meal like at any other restaurant. The lights are turned way up and there's no music playing so it's a bit of a surreal dining experience. I only ever ate on days after the place was renovated and Gordon changed the menu, so the food was good and I didn't see any crazy drama or yelling. Random notes:\n\n- At one of them my buddy said he thought he saw a hair on his plate, and a producer and cameraman rushed over to film it. The producer said \"I think that's yours\" and my buddy agreed so they walked away. Didn't make the episode.\n\n- Another time our appetizers were running a few minutes late, not so much that we actually noticed, but enough that it ended up being a dramatic commercial break on the finished episode, complete with shots of us looking around concerned about something.\n\n- At a third taping our dinner was running very late. A producer kept asking us if we wanted to leave, saying that they would totally understand if we walked out right now, and that if we did they would comp our meal the following night if we came back. I guess they needed shots of angry customers walking out because service was slow? We stayed anyway and the owner came over and bought us shots. \n\nI never went back to any of the places after taping but I'm pretty sure they've all since closed down. ",
            "I worked in the post-production stage of some early Kitchen Nightmares in the UK. Off camera Gordon is  a lot nicer. When he visits the kitchen he walks around and inspects it. You can see him getting more and more worked up whenever he sees something wrong. What you see on TV is a cut down version at the climax of his anger. I wouldn't say its fake but more like a slice of a much longer engagement between Gordon and the kitchen staff and owners. I wasn't on set and have never met the man. I couldn't tell you if he is putting on a performance with a slow build or if he is genuinely angry. I have seen the unedited rushes though so I can tell you he is not reading a script. ",

The place was packed with camera men walking around and Gordon was pretty much hanging out talking with people when we were there.  The food wasn't great and the wait times were long, but this place was usually empty so that probably had more to do with it.  Also we did have to pay for dinner (we thought it would be covered by the show since they know it won't be great).\nWe were sat by the bar up front and were not seen in the episode.\nAfter the show we went back a few times and really liked it (we even went there the night we got engaged), the owner and staff were always really nice and even offered us free drinks.\nSad that it closed though.

We went back a few weeks later and spoke to the owner, he was glad for the experience. He's still in business today. Overall, it was a tv production but the problems with a restaurant were real.\n\nOne interesting note, we were told not to wear white.  When I went to the bathroom Ramsey was screaming at the owner \"i wouldn't feed that to my Fucking dog\". Classic Ramsey\n\nAnother note: Ramsey whispered to the owner when he was leaving, he told him to build up the restaurant and then sell it and build a bigger one. \n\nAnother another note, I was told by the owner that GR has a small earpiece he wears, so when something happens were he isn't it is reported to him by the producers into the earpiece. They have cameras and microphones everywhere. \n\nI am really sorry I forgot this little tidbit in the original post. My apologies. ",

We were the only two customers there.\n\nFunny though, even though we were the only customers there, they still managed to fuck up our food. They gave our food away to the crew. It was an honest mistake and we had a laugh about it. Super nice guys, but they just couldn\u2019t make it work.

So, after listening a bit, I gently, and politely, point out how it differs from what he is saying. He looks around at \"his\" crowd, and tells me I'm way off and don't get it; that I just don't understand.

Master Label certification is as close to a requirement for every job as anything can be.  \n\nTwo weeks after we submit our design it comes back with a revise/resubmit stamp and a very snarky demand from the Corps that we change our design to the one provided in the bid package.

Sometimes the bar has a medium of 0.33l as well, that doesnt really have a name.  \n\n\nAnyway, most people drink Flutes or Vases. You'd order \"a Flute, please\" or \"a Vase, please\" and you'll always be served the house pilsner (moest well know one is Heineken, of course) in the size you ordered. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you might have guessed by now, I am a bartender. I was at work in a bar and had a group of 5 dudes drinking Vases, a lot of them too. Thing is; is you order \"a beer\", you'll be served a vase of pilsner as a standard. Everyone knows this, it's common knowledge (in the Netherlands) and noone ever objects to it.  \n\n\nThese dudes had been ordering \"5 beers, please\" the whole night. They were served vases (so 0,25L) the whole night. When time came to pay, I gave them their bill and it said 35 X Vase pf Heineken.  \n\n\nThen they tried to argue with me that the glass I served them, the 0,25L one, is not a Vase but a Flute, that a Flute was 0,25 and not 0,18 and that a Vase is 0,33l. I told them dudes I was not going to argue about something as ridiculous as this, as anyone who drinks beer in the Netherlands knows what a Flute and a Vase is, and everyone know what size they are. But they refused to pay, so I told them to google it. They did. They found a website that listed the sizes and names of the glasses, but they wouldnt believe it because \"the website must be owned by heineken\" Sure, a Flute and Vase conspiracy, that's a new one.   \n\n\nThey told me the bar next door serves a vase of 0,33l for the same price we serve a 0,25l one, so they weren't going to pay. I told them to cut their crap, that I work in that bar too (I do) and that the price of a 0,33 was higher than our 0,25 and that it's not called a vase. He didn't believe me and looked up their drinks menu (as if it would even matter what the prices next door were, even IF they would be lower). He found out that, once again, I was right, but had some bullshit excuse as to why I was still wrong...  \n\n\nIn the end I told them to pay or I'd call the cops, so they paid but said they were going to write a complaint e-mail which I encouraged them to do. At this point even other costumers were telling them to stop being ridiculous cunts. I kindly asked them to never return again. They came back in a week later, but I told them they would not be served, they tried ordering drink from my co-worker but he told them to fuck off too so they just stood at the bar for a while and left.

            "An analysis of a case report included a direct quotation from a congenitally blind man.\n\n>I started taking drugs at a very young age, but the one I felt the most connected with, apart from cannabis, was called 'Blue Pentagon', basically LSD! Every time I did acid, I experienced something new and spectacular. Obviously through the senses which are available to me! I never had any visual images come to me. I can\u2019t see or imagine what light or dark might look like. With LSD and cannabis though, I experienced so much through my hearing, touch and emotions that it was already enough for me to take!\n\n\n>There was a marked di\ufb00erence between hallucinations and dreaming. On acid, I de\ufb01nitely knew that I was awake, although on unfamiliar territory: not like dreaming. During my psychedelic experiences, whenever I listened to music, I felt as if I was immersed in the most beautiful waterfall ever. The episode of the waterfall was the nearest I ever came to experiencing anything like synesthesia. The music of Bach's third Brandenburg concerto brought on the waterfall e\ufb00ect. I could hear violins playing in my soul and found myself having a one hour long monologue using di\ufb00erent tones of voices. I remember they sounded extremely unique! LSD gave everything 'height'. The sounds coming from songs I would normally listen to became three dimensional, deep and delayed. It seemed that music began coming apart and unravelling. My favourite track began to echo in my mind, as if my brain would hear the music played in the present, but while still hanging onto what I had heard a second before. It was like a tape loop that kept on echoing. This led me to look within and I became more aware of myself and the understanding of life, of people, and the music I was listening to. I felt like my brain was overloaded with information and I could not take all of it in at once! On one of my trips, I remember \ufb01nding myself touching a tree, on the way to my friend's house. This felt amazing! Just like a tree from the forest, or the jungle. Walking that day felt almost as if I wasn\u2019t heavy on land and I was racing at such a tremendous speed that it felt like I was actually \ufb02ying.\n\nSource: Dell'Erba, Brown, and Proulx. \"Synesthetic hallucinations induced by psychedelic drugs in a congenitally blind man.\" Journal of Consciousness and Cognition, Vol. 60, pp. 127-132, doi: \n10.1016/j.concog.2018.02.008. 2018.",

He was born with a type of disease i cannot pronounce or spell. He is a frequent cannabis smoker.  \n>  \n>\u00a0 When i got up this morning e had a small breakfast of fruit, and then i removed it from the frisge and explained to him what it was, and the process, and that i had a theory....  \n>  \n>\u00a0 His visual cortex is completely intact, but he just doesnt have eyes, sohe should be able to have a dmt experience, he has never had any true psychedelics before today, as the duration of the experiences put him off from it.\u00a0 My theory was that, never having had the experience of vision , he would not be able to describe what it was that happened, but i would be able to tell if it did based on his reaction.  \n>  \n>\u00a0 So...i convinced hi it was worth the 10 minutes it takes, and convinced him he would benefit fro the experience. and if not, hell its only 10 minutes.  \n>  \n>\u00a0 I helped guide him down to my pond, i set up some lan chairs as it was in the upper 50s today and sunny, felt really nice. i loaded the bowl, gave it to hi and helped hi light it....he took three huge rips, holding each in probably 20 seconds.  \n>  \n>Now Coty usually hold his eyes closed, the only time ive ever seen his eyes was when i first met him, he has to actively try to open them because its a movement he almost NEVER does, he does not have the uscle memory for it so it take effort for him.  \n>  \n>as soon as he let out the last hit his eyes opened, not just open they SHOT WIDE open, he leaned onto his knees out of the chair, how he could even move i not sure, but he started sobbing, he cried for about 7 minutes...  \n>  \n>\u00a0 As suspected he cannot say anything but one word about the experience, ALL he can say, with sobbing tears, is \"so beautiful, so beatuiful, i cant....i dont....its just so beautiful\"  \n>  \n>This was abut 10 hours ago....hes still asking me if that is what seeing is....",

            "I'm retirement age, and I wish I knew the answer to this.  I'm an aspie as well, and it just complicates the hell out of things.  I texted someone today, asking if I could text them tonight to chat.  I know they got it (they check their phone constantly for new texts), they just never replied.  Which hurts, hurts a lot.\n\nI think I just don't understand friendship.  I don't feel close to anyone, and don't feel loved by anyone at all, anywhere in this life.\n\nIf you get a good answer, OP, please share.  I've been at this a long time and I'm often lonely as hell.\n\nEDIT: Since I'm getting  a good number of replies regarding my text to asking if my friend is up for chatting later, it's how we do things.  This is my favourite person at work, I adore them, and we've been friends for years.  But they have a busy life, and so we sometimes arrange to chat later by texting and asking in advance.  Sort of like, \"Hey -- talk later?\"\n\nEDIT #2: She did text me.  To say she doesn't want me to text her anymore.  I still don't know what I did, but right now my heart feels like a single-use plastic shopping bag filled with hurt and shit, slowing draining out through a hole in the bottom.  I looked forward to seeing her every day.  Her smile, her laughter could make the worst day brighter and better.  And it's gone now.  And I feel stupid.  I don't take chances on friendship much anymore, and this is why.  I find someone, we become friends, and then something like this happens.\n\nThe kicker for me is that I believe that if you value people, then you actually ask them, \"Hey, why did you do that?  That really bothered me!\"  But if you see the person a disposable, then you just end it, like she did today.  \n\nI have learned nothing from being alive, apparently.  I have grown older, but no wiser.",
            "In what context are you using lonely? Lonely like \"I'm an introvert and I find it hard to talk to people so I dont have alot of friends\" or lonely like \"I just moved from LA to Tallahassee and I dont know anybody here\"",

            "Join a jail",

            "I see a lot of comments here that are like \"just put yourself out there\"! Which is fine and all. I'm not that socially awkward and have a lot of . . . acquaintances.\n\nBut how do you get past the small talk phase to make long lasting and deep friendships? Whenever I open up about myself it usually isn't reciprocated or I feel like I'm being emo and burdening someone. Or I feel like I'm prodding other people to open up about themselves when they don't want to.\n\nCLARIFICATION: Thank you for all your kind responses and tips! When I say \"opening up\", I really don't mean unloading my life's story on a person I've only known for a few months. It's pretty intuitive not to do that. These are people I could have known for years and seen on a daily basis in that time. I struggle with making that shift to a less platonic relationship. I could SWEAR I do ask them lots of questions about themselves, and I think that's what makes me strong in the \"good small talk\" department. I can't even tell if I'm trying too hard or not hard enough. Also, is it a problem if I'm always the one making plans with people when I muster the guts to? I don't mind, but it sucks to not get invited. And I don't know how to \"infiltrate\" a friend group. Like I feel like there's something seriously wrong with my personality.\n\nEDIT: So reading these responses, I'm realizing that I might have some other issues I need to work on in order to be receptive to relationships. I have a pretty low-self esteem, I tend to blame myself and only myself for past \"failed\" relationships, and I am hyper-aware of what (I think) others think of me. A thousand other things I'm sure. Scrolling through Instagram and seeing groups of friends doing fun stuff together really REALLY gets me down, and I don't think it's because of jealousy. I'm disappointed in myself that I can't force people to like me. Which is so wrong on so many levels.\n\n\\#2: Fuck, thanks for my first gold! I'm literally crying",

            "Hi I'm a kid who fell through the cracks. \n\nGot diagnosed with dyscalculia when I was a sophomore in high school. \n\nThroughout the years, my parents would tell counselors, psychologists, etc. that something wasn't right and it was more than me \"being bad at math\". It took a really badass teacher I had pushing and advocating for me to get an official diagnosis before anyone did anything. \n\nI understand fully that sometimes parents can be a pain in the ass, but please, please, please, if a kid is 15/16 years old and is stuck at a 5th grade math level, look into it.",

It is not your job to appease others so that they can emotionally regulate themselves.",

            "Psychotherapist here.\n\nSome things I see regularly that could have been caught earlier before they became a problem:\n\n* Unhealthy coping mechanisms. For example, drinking \"to relax\" frequently or smoking a lot. Even something like promiscuity can be a red flag that a person is trying to avoid dealing with something stressful by distracting themselves.\n* Self harm. Hitting yourself, banging your head on things, burning yourself on purpose, cutting yourself, etc. - all of those things indicate that it's time to talk with a professional.\n* \"Normal\" child/teen behaviors that are not actually normal, like running away or getting into fights.\n* Not communicating. When this happens, something is usually wrong (not always, as some folks are quieter than others). But if a child/teen/adult rarely speaks or if they are silent in the presence of their parent or significant other, it's time to get them to see a professional ALONE to have their safety assessed. I've seen individuals who are literally shut down due to having been profoundly abused by the people they live with and one of the main signs of that is silence. I've also seen people in perfectly good homes who cannot communicate due to extreme anxiety and without professional help it's hard for them to overcome this.\n* Mood swings. When a person's moods change from one extreme to another fairly often/regularly that is another concerning symptom. Sometimes they are considered eccentric or hormonal, but that sort of thing can be a sign of many problems from bipolar disorder to post traumatic stress disorder.\n\nEDIT: Wow, thanks for my first gold and silver!

Let us help you.\n\nEdited to add:\n\nI\u2019ve noticed cost coming up in a lot of these replies. I hate that cost is such a barrier for people. :( \n\nSometimes colleges offer free or discounted therapy from their students. When you\u2019re training to be a therapist, you spend at least 1 year working as a therapist while meeting with a supervisor each week to consult on your cases and get guidance on moving forward. \n\nMy college unfortunately didn\u2019t offer discounted sessions, but I know many do. It might be worth checking out. \n\nSome systems also have charity care options for people with low incomes. That can be worth pursuing as well. \n\nTo find a therapist, if you\u2019re in the US, you can call your insurance company and get a list of places that take your insurance. That\u2019s a good place to start."

We say 'poft\u0103 bun\u0103' which I think it's the equivalent of the French 'bon app\u00e9tit'. When my coworkers go for lunch I would say stuff like 'enjoy your meal' and often they would look funny at me and be like 'Um ok, thanks I guess' thinking I'm sarcastic when I'm not.\n\nEDIT: hope I got the French spelling correct now. And as a little side note, I read some people pointing out how saying that might be formal or to be expected from a waiter at a restaurant or in a professional setting, rather than the colloquial version of how I'm thinking of or want it to come out as. For instance, your friend says he's about to go to lunch, you wish him 'poft\u0103 bun\u0103', you just got home and your parents are having dinner, you tell them 'poft\u0103 bun\u0103', your waiter brought you food, he tells you 'poft\u0103 bun\u0103', you see your teacher on a food break, you can tell him 'poft\u0103 bun\u0103'. It's universal regardless of who is eating, it's important that they are and you wish they'll have a good appetite and they enjoy their food.

            "I just look for honesty and some self respect . The roles I hire for and fairly entry level so you dont need to be amazingly qualified or anything . \nI get a lot of young people for interviews and what annoys me the most is when they arrive dressed in casual clothes , I dont disregard their application over clothes, but I do sit and wonder why their friends or parents or partners let them come to an interview in such sloppy clothing.\n\n\n\nThat said,  I did have a weird one, i hired a guy from a group like session , as he was probably the best and most confident person on the day. After hiring a few weeks in he starts to become unreliable with his late finishes. When I ask him what's up with that,  he comes in one day on his day off and says he needs to speak to me. He then tells me that he will be resigning becuase he cant make the later working hours , and that hes sorry for letting me down and appreciates us giving him a chance , then he lifts up his Jean leg and shows me a electronic tag on his ankle . Turns out he was released from prison 2 days before my interview,  and said he never brought it up becuase in a room full of people why would anyone employ the ex con.\n\n\nWhen I thought about it , hes probably right me and my colleague who were interviewing probably would have influenced our decision on him if we knew and he said he just wanted a fair chance .\n\n\nSo the tag prevented him from  being outside his home after 7pm as he was charged for supply when younger . I ended up calling the parole officer and the HMRC and eventually altering his curfew on the basis that I said he would have to be jobless if they didn't and if you dont allow him to have a legitimate job , what are the chances of him re offending gonna be.\n\nEnded up being one of best employees for a while.",

He looked at me with a disgusted face, like I just insulted him. I asked him what was wrong, and he replied \"Nothing really. It seems like a pretty good position, but I want something better, because I can clearly see you are impressed by my resume\"  \n\n\nI took the bait, and partly also due to our immediate need for engineers, asked him what his preferred position would be. He immediately answered that he wanted a supervisory position, like the General Production Manager. I asked him why he wanted such a position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis reply? \"Seems like one of those jobs where I can sit in the office and play games on my phone all day without having to actually do anything\"  \n\n\nI quickly gave an excuse to end the interview right there and just told him we would call him.

            "I was a new graduate student freshly arrived in the US and very poor, and I couldn't afford a laptop, so the only way I could communicate with my family was to hit up the library and use a public computer to email with them. Eventually my girlfriend back home wanted to skype, and I wanted a little privacy for this if you know what I mean, so I set about finding the most private computer available to me in the library.   \n\nOn a recon mission the day before the Skype, I located a single computer in a conference room and the next morning got up at 7am to account for the time difference and walked into the conference room with my eyes totally focused on the computer. I'd actually walked most of the way in before I realized there was a group of people around the conference table having a ridiculously early morning meeting. The guy at the head of the table, apparently thinking I'd showed up for the meeting and that I was heading towards him, handed me a paper that said \"agenda\" and said he was so glad a graduate student had shown up, then launched into the most incomprehensible talk about electrodes and chemistry.   \n\nMeanwhile I know my girlfriend is sitting halfway around the world thinking we're going to have sexy time Skype and I'm blowing her off and I'm feeling desperate. But everything I knew about US culture was only based on movies, so I have no idea if I can just apologize and leave or what. I miserably sat down for the incomprehensible meeting, rehearsing all the excuses I can give my girlfriend when we talk later. I was barely paying attention. Eventually questions were directed at me and I confess that I'm a new grad student and I don't know much about the equipment they're talking about. Everyone excitedly tells me all about it and I still don't totally understand what they mean, except I'm starting to get that they're going on a research expedition to [an insanely exciting inaccessible dangerous place] and they're building a piece of equipment to bring with them. \n\nBy the end of the meeting I am part of the project. 6 months later I am in [an insanely exciting inaccessible dangerous place] helping to operate this equipment. I appear briefly in the background of a Discovery Channel documentary (only black guy within hundreds of miles so easy to spot). I happily transfer to this other lab and this other field for my fully paid and stipended PhD.

Have a new girlfriend now and have never told her this story for obvious reasons. Also my advisor doesn't know. He was the enthusiastic guy at the head of the table and he loves his work so much that he never questioned that a business major would show up to hear all about it and get converted to love it as much as he does.

            "edit: My earliest memory (not related to NK) is from 1984. The following is an account from around 1984-1987.\n\nI remember propaganda cartoons on TV - from the 70s - that showed communists as animals. There was a series called \ub618\uc774\uc7a5\uad70 where there was a young boy who fought communists, who were shown as animals. I found some videos on YouTube, for example: https://youtu.be/PNxySc3L7-I?t=53m20s\n\nOn one hand we were taught that reunification should be the goal, and we sang a song titled \"Our Wish is Unification,\" but on the other hand, we were taught that communists were evil and they did horrible things, axe-murdering American soldiers at the Panmunjeom (a neutral meeting place), ~~slicing~~ tearing open the mouth of a young boy who shouted \"I don't like communists/the communist party\" (the kid is said to have died and there was a monument at his home town or something).\n\nThe north were said to be digging tunnels to surprise-attack the south, and if you went to the borders you could visit the tunnels yourself - that had luckily been discovered beforehand.\n\nPropaganda materials from the north could be found in the countryside (dropped from balloons? scattered by spies?) and if you found them and turned them in to your teacher, you could get pencils as a reward.\n\nThere were said to be undercover agents living among us, northern spies pretending to be from the south. If somebody didn't know the latest fads you'd ask them \"are you a spy?\" as a joke. We were taught to be suspicious of people who weren't aware of current events.",

(\"Wow you're really from there??\") \n\nI think it's also important to note there were still many people whose grandparents were from the North. My grandpa, for example, was from the North and had a whole family there. He was down south on business when it all happened and never quite made his way back I suppose. He is no longer with us and he never found out what happened to his previous family.

A lot of good responses here on the sociopolitical perspective, so I will share some personal anecdotes on how the KR institution educates its people on NK.\n\nWhen I was in elementary school, the teachings were mostly on pity toward the North Korean general population, especially the children. Every now and then we would be given assignments to write letters to our North Korean peers. I remember writing one, and all I could write about was how I'd like to send them some of my favorite snacks, because I was taught in school that they were impoverished and shut off from the rest of the world.\n\nWhen I was in highschool, we learned more about the exploits of the regime, and the importance of democracy. The teachings became more about appreciating what we have in South Korea and understanding the failed government in North Korea.\n\nWhen I was a soldier in the Korean Army (ROK Army), we were grilled day and night on the belligerent nature of the North Korean government, and how the Kim Dynasty is slaving the NK people. Our shooting targets are still cut outs of NK soldiers.\n\nIf you can tell, the nuance for pity and sympathy toward the general North Korean public is constant throughout. South Korea's institutional stance toward NK people still has a warm spot. Movies, TV shows, and other media portraying the sorrows of a divided people are still popular.\n\nTo sum up, we are taught to feel sympathy toward the NK people and hate the dictatorship. ",

We were also taught not to waste food because NK \"kkotjaebi\" (orphaned homeless kids who eat off spilled foods on the market grounds) does not have the luxury to eat what we eat. We were also taught that we have to alert the police of military of any suspicious individuals who may be the NK spies. \n\nMy grandparents are from Kaesong before Korean conflict happened and majority of their family are in NK. We don't know if any of them is alive or well, but just hope that one day we get to see them. \n\nPlease mind the grammar\n\nI will stick around to answer any Qs!!\n\nEdit: Thanks kind stranger!!

SK is definitely the good guys, look how rich we are now compared to them, they lost the Cold War and it's only a matter of time until they collapse. \n\nEthno-nationalist doctrine: North Koreans are our own blood, and they are starving (see: arduous march), we gotta help them. New liberal president of SK, Kim Dae Joong initiates the Sunshine Policy to be kinder and friendlier to the North, and the future is bright for all Koreans. \n\nCompare that to today, where most everyone is either apathetic or hateful towards NK, or nostalgic of the old days (see: Moon Jae-In platform). Mostly apathetic, but them North Koreans are getting p close to getting ICBMs soooo... \n\nEdit: I wrote this in a hurry before my final exam began, so I regret not being able to provide more in-depth information in a less off-the-cuff tone. I would like to point out that these views are not mutually exclusive. Like all human behaviour, there is hypocrisy in the strongest of black-and-white opinions, and in a politically diverse yet ethnically homogeneous country like South Korea, there is always room for a little Column A, a little Column B, and a Column who-gives-a-fuck. \n",
            "I am 34 and was raised in Korea until 12. At my age, it really is not too different from what you would get at other democratic nations I guess. North Korea was a starving communist country that always threatened and was wiling to attack South Korea at any given opportunty. NK caused the Korean War that cost the peninsula dearly, but global alliance headed by America saved SK. Despite the war, South Koreans who are naturally smart with superior work ethics (not what i think but was jist of what they taught) drove the economy to grow at a tremendous speed (miracle of Han river as Koreans call it), surprising the entire world while NK was still starving and forever looking for ways to attack SK. \n\nMeanwhile, we were also taugh NK and SK is one country, and that reunification is the dream of all Koreans, and that we should strive for reunification without really talking about the methods.... \n\nBut my parents era is completely different.

Forgive me.\n\nPrepare your collective bodies for a long ass story.\n\nI grew up in SK (Seoul, born and raised!), stayed in the country til I was 15, before moving out of the country.\n\n\nWhen I was in grade school, (this was almost throughout the 2000s), we were taught that our brothers up north were, indeed, brothers. It was Kim Jong Il that we were supposed to hate. This was, restrospectively, a reflection of our regime at the time; President Kim Dae Joong and President Roh Mu Hyeon (both are considered very liberal. Only liberal presidents we've ever had, in fact. Both of whom I respect and admire greatly). \n\n***\nTangent time! Pres. Kim adopted the \"Sunlight Policy\", which was loosly based on one of Aesop's Fables; The North Wind and the Sun. He thought if we were to show kindness and graciousness towards the North, they would open up to us as the wanderer in the fable did. \n\nWe gave millions of tons of food and billions of Korean Won to NK, all of which sat ill with our elder demographic which was vastly conservative (fearing the \"Red\", accusing anyone liberal as being a Commie POS, the usual shtick).\n\nIt played out as planned. The North warmed up to us. We had trade! For the first time in decades! We had tourism as well for a select few!! All this was vehemently limited, what with tiny groups of tourists to the North (one of whom got lethally shot while HAVING A STROLL IN A RESTRICTED AREA IN THE CRAZIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, but thats a story for another day), and one company from the North selling a few goods down South.\n\nBut we were getting somewhere. There was progress that was absent for half a century.\n\nThen everything changed when the ~~Fire Nation attacked~~ conservy AF presidents came into power and the North clammed right back up. Our current relations with NK is worse than ever, with frequent provocations and mortality amongst soldiers on both ends. Time to end the tangent.\n***\n\nWe were taught songs on Reunion. It went like: *Our wish is Reunion, even in our dreams: reunion*. Proper propaganda sounding material. We were educated EXTENSIVELY throughout grade school and middle school about the Korean War (or, as Koreeens call it, 6.25 war. Cause it started on June 25th, 1950). We were taught on how after we were FREEDOM'D by the States after 4 decades of getting fucked by Japan in every possible oriface, the Cold War settled into our tiny peninsula and how the war started. Throughout these history lessons, neither the material nor the teachers had negative views towards the North. We weren't told of the gory details when we were just overgrown babies (in Grade school). About the public executions, reality of the famine, constant fear of the leader, etc.\n\nThen there's the military service, where every male member of the population have to go through.This is mainly, if not only, due to the division of Korea. So dudes hate the fact that we live in a country where the current truce goes back decades.\n\nI know the question is about how we were informed of NK in school, and I know that I've ranted just about everything *but* education.\n\nBut the truth is, in SK nowadays, noone really gives half a shit about Korea.\n\nThis next part might just apply to yours truly, but it might as well be just another country at war. \n\nWe don't feel the constant ominous pressure blowing down from above: no, the most we ever get to feel that our former- nation is divided and now is currently at war with one another, is through news reports, just as you would if you lived in North America, Europe or just about anywhere else.\n\nWe don't dread the \"inevitable war that draws ever-so-closer\". We have so much shit on our plates to deal with, even within the country, thank you very much.\n\n\n\nThis is long. Wow. I'm pretty sure I was just on an old-man-rant for about 90% of this text wall, but if you feel like you can take at least something off my comment, then shit, I've done my part.\n\nI'll be here all night folks. Shoot your Qs.",
            "I have a good story about my familial ties to North Korea.  \n\nBefore there was ever a North or South Korea, my grandfather married a women and had a few children.  When the war broke out and the country was divided, most if not all Koreans had to choose whether to live in the North or the South.  This was right before the divide so going across borders were fairly normal albeit the dangers of the war zones.  \n\nThe North, with the backing of China and the communist party, would establish Kim Il Sung as the dictator.  Thus, my grandfather chose to relocate to the South.  His plan was to head out towards the trains first in order to insure safe passage for his family to the train station.  Upon arrival, he waited for his wife and kids to arrive but they never came.\n\nAfter waiting for what could have been a week, he had to make the choice of leaving without his family.  He told my father that he never heard from them, how could he as they were separated for good after the borders were established?  \n\nAfter arriving in South Korea, he met my grandmother and started a new family.  For all we know, we have a lineage of step relatives living in North Korea who may have no idea we exist.\n\nThis is solely on what my father has told me and in no way verifiable.  Thanks for listening to my family's historical short story!\n\nTLDR; grandfather left North Korea, effectively leaving his wife and kids, never to be reunited again, and started a new family in South Korea after the countries divided."

With this shock, shitting becomes a problem for a few. Well, every DI after the first week is required to ask around if everyone has taken a shit, and from there he assigns one recruit to track who has shit and who has not. I shit you not (pun intended), we had one guy who would stand in the barracks at the end of the night rolling off names of people who hadn\u2019t shit yet.

The time comes and recruit can\u2019t shit excuses himself. We all follow our DI into the bathroom and slide him under there like he\u2019s the spawn of Satan.

He was hotboxing in his garage while working underneath his car that was supported by scissor jacks. Something to note, the car didn't have any tires on the front end where he was working. One of the scissor jacks had slipped out from underneath the car, and the whole weight of the car landed directly onto the side of his head with no tires to stop the fall. We got our rubber airbags out, lifted the car, pulled him out, and got him onto a stretcher. After taking 2,500 lbs of weight to the head, he somehow got out of it with a fractured orbital and a laceration on his cheek.",
            "First year of my core surgical training I was on call in a very small rural hospital. This hospital only had 2 doctors on at night, me and a medical trainee, and no emergency doctors.\n\nIt's about 11pm and this guy, 26 comes in after being in a fight. Blood pumping from his nose which was clearly fractured. I suspected he probably had other facial fractures underneath but he was awake and talking to me, otherwise seemed fine. I spent about 45 minutes trying to stop the blood, using all sorts of nose packs, pressure, even tried a catheter balloon to try and tamponade it. Nothing was working, and he was starting to go into shock, and I was basically shitting myself at this stage. Based on his vitals I'd estimated he'd lost almost 1.5 litres of blood so far. Nearest proper surgical hospital was 45 minutes away, and my consultant was at home, 25 minutes from the hospital. \n\nEventually I got four bags of o neg from the lab (the lab tech happened to be in, which was very lucky), put this guy in the back of an ambulance, still bleeding, and sent him blue light to the surgical centre in the city. Got a phone call about 3 hours later from a surgeon at the other hospital, saying he had brought the patient to theatre and been able to control the situation. He was probably 15 minutes from dead. \n\nIf you come into that kind of small hospital with that much bleeding, all stats say you're in trouble. The guy was very lucky his friends got him in so quickly.",

Chest compressions start and within minutes the A&E consultant is performing an open thoracotomy in order to start cardiac massage. \n\n\nCardiothoracics join us quickly and get to work on the heart - a hole in the right ventricle is identified and plugged with a Foley catheter. All the while bag after bag of o neg is being pushed into the patient in an attempt to replace everything that had pumped out of his heart and into his thoracic cavity. 15-20 mins into this the impossible happens - we get ROSC (the heart starts beating in its own). Patient is taken directly to theatre where the hole is definitively repaired and bilateral chest drains are inserted to drain the blood filling his lungs (technically the pleural space). Somehow his heart continued beating and after a couple weeks on ITU, the patient is returned to the trauma ward awake and alert.

This started with a one hour flight from Edinburgh to London Gatwick where we'd catch our flight to Bridgetown. \n\nSo in the check in line at Edinburgh there's a family, 2 parents, one daughter maybe my age, possibly a wee bit older, and three kids under 10. The wee ones are running around all over the place while the parents seem to ignore them. We think \"fine, it's the general British Airways checkin, they're probably flying to Heathrow.\" \n\nThey weren't. They were two or three rows behind us. \n\nWe get through Gatwick connections and security and don't see them so they're probably at a gate across the airport. \n\nYeah they weren't. As we're boarding the plane we see them sprinting towards the gate. And of course they're in the two rows in front of my family. Oh and this is an 8 hour overnight flight so we're in for a night of no sleep. \n\nThe kids were out of control, screaming constantly, climbing over the seats, running up and down the aisle (even into first class much to the anger of the first class stewardess) and no matter what other passengers and crew say, the parents just won't do anything. That was a very long eight hours. \n\nThankfully they weren't staying at our hotel and we were staying for the unusual length of 12 night so there was no chance they'd be on our flight back. \n\n\nTake a guess what happens next.\n\nLuckily they were right at the back for the long flight and nowhere near us on the short jaunt back up to Edinburgh. \n\n\nIn short, I don't support child-free flights, I support shitty parent-free flights. \n\nTl;dr: Awful family of awful kids with awful parents ruin two eight hour flights.

            "I'm curious if anyone else has had this happen. Years ago, my then wife and I would run into the same woman everywhere we went. And I mean everywhere we went. This went on for about a year. Go to the grocery store? She would be there shopping. Starbucks? Yep, sitting right behind us. Walking around the mall? She would pass us walking in the other direction. Movie theater? She'd be behind us in line getting popcorn. The creepiest encounter was while driving on the freeway. My wife looked at the car next to us and screamed. Yep, it was her. She was always alone, never talked to us, and always made eye contact. She had a very unique appearance. She was very tall, very thin, and had very tight skin on her face. It was so unusual that we joked that we were being studied by an alien. It was some serious 'glitch in the Matrix' stuff.",
            "It was years ago, when I was about 17. I had gotten home from school and wasn\u2019t feeling well so I spent the rest of the day just laying on the couch. By about 8p I was feeling even worse and decided I should just try to sleep whatever it is off so I go to my room and get in bed and pass out pretty quickly. \n\nI don\u2019t know how long I was asleep, but I suddenly woke up in my pitch black bedroom and all I could think was \u201cI\u2019m going to die right now.\u201d My body was so weak, the room was spinning and my body felt like it was on fire. I look over to the edge of my bed and sitting on the edge is my grandmother, who died just a few months ago. She pats my arm and says \u201cIt\u2019s going to be ok. Just call for your Dad. Try it. Call for your Dad.\u201d So I start calling for him and it felt like an eternity but he finally burst through my door and asks what\u2019s wrong. I look over and my grandmother is gone. \n\nAfter that, he gets me up and takes me to the E.R. where I have a fever of 106F which explains a lot. I had to get a ton of fluids and a shot in my hip but I eventually felt ok-ish. \n\nHer being there felt so real. It was so weird. I know logically she wasn\u2019t but it felt so real. That sort of messed with me a little. I loved her dearly and her death was very sudden. We kept her ashes in a nice urn in the house under a painting she had done herself. When I got home and passed by I said thanks to her. I know it was the fever melting my brain and maybe some sleep paralysis but...it still made me question the \u201cafterlife\u201d and those sorts of things.",
            "I've told this before, but about 7 years ago I was at my mom's house (I live next door) and this white car pulls into the driveway. We weren't expecting anyone so I assumed they were lost and needed directions, and went to the door. \n\nA white woman in her 50s or 60s got out, along with a 9 or 10 year old black girl. Surprised me because I expected the kid to stay in the car if they just needed directions. I open the door and the woman kind of nudges the girl towards me, both with big smiles on their faces. I said hi, what can I help you with? She asked if I was BaggyRaccoon and I said yes. She told me they went to a neighbor's house looking for me, and they pointed her to our house. \n\nThy just kind of stared at me expectantly, like I was supposed to know the girl and be happy to see her. When I didn't react, the woman told me they were here to see the dentist. Uhh... no dentists here. Small ranch style house in a fairly rural neighborhood. No, no dentists here. Not anywhere near us. The woman and the girl just kept smiling. They didn't look confused. They just kept saying, \"are you sure?\" \n\nFinally they left and later I asked the neighbor who directed them to our house and she said she never told the woman my name, that the woman asked for me specifically. It's always kind of haunted me. I really feel like I was supposed to know that girl. Like (if I was a guy) this would be someone trying to introduce me to a kid I didn't know I had. I honestly started wondering if I was nuts and had given up a child for adoption. It was that strange of a feeling! My mom firmly believes the girl will come back someday to tell me what it was about, and I think about it frequently. Drives me insane to wonder what they really wanted.",
            "When I was 12 or so and still living at my parents\u2019 house I woke up in the middle of the night to pee. I got to the bathroom and heard what sounded like a party going on downstairs. Laughter, music,  the sound of glasses being knocked together for a toast...the whole shebang. I thought it was weird that my parents had friends over so late and hadn\u2019t told me, but I decided to go and see who was there. Opened the door to the kitchen and the entire downstairs was completely dark and silent, not even a TV on. I was thoroughly confused but the strangeness of the situation didn\u2019t really register, so I never told anyone. Years and years later I mentioned this to my dad and he said he had heard \u201cthem\u201d too. Turns out there used to be a small public bar in their home, which is over 150 years old.

            "Not me but my grandfather.\n\n\u00a0my grandfather had been in ww2 and told us about when himself and a few other soldiers had been separated from his unit and we\u2019re trying to get to Normandy, they had gone through a clearing in a wooded area but had to drop when they heard something approaching. They were on their bellies in low grass when they saw 20 or 30 German soldiers running across the clearing clearly in a state of panic, then they just froze in mid step. He said they resembled statues and that some weren\u2019t even touching the ground, and that there was no noise whatsoever, even the birds had gone silent. After a few seconds came a loud noise like metal scraping on concrete and the frozen soldiers started to become blurry to the point at which they vanished without a trace.\nThis had been reported by all of the soldiers that were present and all were called to the war office London after their return to the UK where they were pressed on what they saw over the period of a few days, and we\u2019re taken back to the same spot in France shortly after the war had ended. Surprisingly when they got their, there were other men sharing the same accommodation who reported similar occurrences in the exact same area. They were all taken to the woods and had to describe where and how the events took place. My grandad had said that the entire area was guarded heavily and that part of the ground was heavily excavated. The strangest thing of all the other he said, was that there were hundreds of dogs in the area, just milling around for no apparent reason. They returned to the UK with a gag order ordering them never to speak about any of this. He went back to the same spot in france before he died in 1985 and said that the area had been covered with unmarked warehouses and was guarded by an unusually professional security company. He reckoned they were military.\nI\u2019ve tried to find out more about this but can\u2019t find any records of it, but I do remember one of the guys who he was with the day, he used to come and visit sometimes and referred to the place as \"the splintered woods\"\n",

My first thought was air conditioning but it\u2019s such a clear sound that just cuts through everything as if it\u2019s coming from a whole different world to the general office noise. It's very definitely only in my left ear and I never hear it anywhere else.\n\nEvery time it kicks in I very calmly just get up and leave my desk for five minutes and when I come back it's gone.",
            "I've related this before but I'll repeat it again. \n\nI can think of a few things that happened in my first year of college. I used to live in an apartment kind of place on campus, with three other people. We all had our separate bedrooms, but shared a living space. It was on the seventh floor, to give a better idea. \n\nOnce, I woke up at around 2AM to find that my phone was automatically playing a song. I closed the app, but it happened 2-3 times again. I would have put this down to my phone being weird, but then one of my roommates told me the exact same thing happened to her as well. This wasn't all. A few days later, I woke up to a beeping sound coming from my phone and when I checked, it was apparently a sound recording. The duration showed as 0.00 though, which meant that it shouldn't technically play at all. I deleted it immediately. \n\nAnother time, my roommate and I were watching a movie and had stayed up till 3. It ended and she went to sleep. After a few minutes, she burst into my room and asked me what I was doing. I was confused because I was just lying in bed, reading. She said that she heard very weird noises from the window, which she assumed I was making, to scare her or something. I went to her room and it sounded like heavy breathing/sighing. I told her it is just the wind. We opened the window and saw that the trees etc were completely still. \n\nI don't have the same phone, room or roommates anymore, even though I still stay on campus.

But he always came in the same work truck with the same guys at the same time of day.\n\nOne day, he walked in and went straight to the bathroom. A minute later, he walked in again and came to the counter.\n\nTwins. It took me eight months to realize they were twins. And not even identical twins, either. They just looked really similar."

The entrance is very thoroughly gated off, and old students say it was an entire underground school with multiple rooms designed classrooms so that even in the event of an air raid, students could continue learning.

            "I see a lot of comments here where redditors mention how hard it is to track what brands belong to the various companies out there and honestly - agreed. There is this \u201cillusion of choice\u201d in so many consumer goods that ultimately trace back to like ten major corporations. I\u2019m not perfect and sometimes convenience comes into play more than I\u2019d like to admit, but after digging into nestle over the years and becoming increasingly disgusted that a company could be so generally evil, I found this app called \u201cbuycott\u201d that lets you scan bar codes of certain products and highlights things like: the illusion of choose and shows what big company it\u2019s from, whether the company violates human rights, equal pay etc. \n\nIt\u2019s not easy and I\u2019m sure it has flaws. But it\u2019s a start. Just wanted to share. We have all the power as consumers to just walk away. \n\nEDIT: remind me not to fall asleep immediately  after i post something. Thanks for the gold. It\u2019s my first and honestly I definitely fall on the side of the lurker on Reddit. One must listen before they can talk hahah so thank you! \n\n1. I do apologize that I didn\u2019t clarify that I was in the United States and honestly, knowing that some of these companies were global I guess i assumed it would be on a global scale. Definitely my mistake.\n\n2. For those telling me \u201cbut who ownsss this app\u201d or please don\u2019t use this app because google and Facebook will take all your information and use it to sell you things\u201d I say.. you\u2019re right, I don\u2019t know who owns it. But I\u2019m trying to educate myself in some way shape or form in order to become more aware of the world around me. It\u2019s a start. I said it wasn\u2019t perfect. As for google taking all my information... well I live in a metropolitan city and i used my smart phone for pretty much everything. It\u2019s an inherent part of my life. It scares me shitless what these companies will do with the power we\u2019ve given them but considering we have free use of the internet and can use things like Reddit to talk to each other I\u2019m also grateful that it\u2019s a tool in my life. Until the new generation of government comes into play, one that can actually understand the internet... idk if we can really expect change. So why not educate yourself so that when/if the right parties get in power, you understand the issues more than you did yesterday. Or maybe run for office .. \n\n3. Someone below said (and I\u2019m paraphrasing) \u201cthe almighty dollar doesn\u2019t have power anymore because of the illusion of choice and consumer power doesn\u2019t exist\u201d I have to say Reddit really bums me out sometimes. I work in an industry that\u2019s near the CPG world and let me tell you. The almighty dollar IS KING. Use your money wisely. If a company tanks... and truthfully tanking is like 1% point decline because they have people to answer too.. they will pay attention. I\u2019m not naive enough to forget how global these companies are and that living in certain areas of the world is a privilege as there are alternative ways to get goods.. but just try and pay attention..it\u2019s not going to be easy or convenient but it\u2019s possible to also demand change\n\nEdit 4: I\u2019m learning so much wow.

It was working out majestically, every day without asking he was doing dishes, cleaning his room, picking up the dog poop, it was epic.  Then one day, I came home and nothing had been done.  I asked him \"hey man, whats up with the dishes? Oh and go pick up the dog poop too.\"  He simply replied, \"Nah\".

We always tried to make him see how lucky he already had it, but he constantly begged us for every toy, candy, and treat he saw anywhere and everywhere. \n\nAround that time, I came across a great photo spread that involved the photographer traveling around the world and snapping photos of different children with their most prized possessions. Of course, the kids in the US, Canada, and Europe were mostly photographed in rooms filled with stuff. But there were also photos of children from impoverished nations, usually showing the child with only one old, dirty stuffed animal. \n\nI thought I was going to accomplish this brilliant parenting move by sitting him down and going through the photos with him. I\u2019d explain how the kids with rooms like his were beyond lucky and he should feel more than satisfied with all of the great stuff that he had. Then I would show him the other photos and he would finally understand that there are so many other children in the world with far less than he had. \n\nWe looked through the photos and talked about each one. We finally got to one with a little boy standing on his cot with his one possession, a well-loved, dingy-looking stuffed monkey. My son looked at if for a long time. I could see his wheels spinning. \u201cSuccess!\u201d I thought. After a long bit of silence, he finally looked up at me, gave me a sweet smile and said, \u201cI want that monkey.\u201d \n\n",

            "This was 13 years ago. I was skateboarding with some buddies at a busy shopping center. A few minutes before leaving, we were waiting at a crosswalk to cross the street. One of my friends takes off running across the crosswalk, and my other buddies follow suit. So I took off as well. I was not even paying attention to the light, but the lane crossing the crosswalk was on a green light.\n\nMy two friends in front were in the clear, but myself and one of my other friends were both hit by a Uhaul truck (yes really, trust me I got shit for YEARS about getting hit by a huge, bright orange truck) going probably 40-45mph. My friend in front of me didn't get hit too bad. I got hit square in the chest. I had no clue at the time what even had happened. I was running, then I was on the ground in a daze, no pain, and I even got up and instinctually ran back to the sidewalk that I had come from. No clue I'd been hit by a truck, I was more just like what in the fuck just happened. A nurse that was at the light came and helped me, told me what had happened and helped me stay calm. She asked if I was having trouble breathing. I was. But it was attributed to me having asthma. Later found out it was because both of my lungs were punctured. \n\nAnyways, the ambulance shows up. I'm holding up very well, no clue why. Kinda just thinking okay damn I must have gotten super lucky. I'm conscious, talking fine, no biggie. They only had one bed in the ambulance, so my buddy was lying on it, and I was sitting hunched over on the bench for the ride (I wish I was joking). We get to the hospital, and I try to pull myself up to get out of the ambulance. And I can't, my shoulders hurt way too bad. The EMS guys tell me I probably dislocated my shoulder and that I'll just have to get it popped in and before I know it I'll be back home. Once inside, WE GET PUT IN THE WAITING ROOM. No I am not joking. We had skateboards with us, and the desk people had no clue. They assumed we just fell on our skateboards or something.\n\nSo I'm still feeling pretty good, other than some sore shoulders, just chilling there watching wheel of fortune. When all of a sudden I start feeling super clammy and disorientied. I remember hearing my mom screaming \"HE'S GOING INTO SHOCK\", and then next thing I know I'm being wheeled down a bunch of hallways. It was like in shows where it's a blur of those florescent lights just flashing overhead one at a time. \n\nI start having severe pain. Like the worst pain you could imagine. But I can't be given an painkillers yet, because I have to go through a bunch of tests first. I'd assume these tests should have been done right when I got there, but what do I know. The one I really remember is having to be picked up off of the bed and put onto one of the machines that required I be on my back. They had people grab each corner of the sheet from the bed that I was on to move me onto it. I remember it kind of squishing my shoulders inward a bit and holy shiiiiiiiiit that was the worst pain I've ever felt. \n\nAnyways, after a ton of tests, it's found out that both of my lungs are punctured. Both of my collar bones are snapped in half. Broken ribs. Cracked sternum. Concussion. The works. Ended up spending the next couple weeks in ICU.\n\nThey didn't have any hospital beds open for me at the time so I actually ended up being transferred to a children's hospital. It was fucking sweet. People came and sang to me and brought me teddy bears n shit. And I was just jacked up on morphine watching Lord of Rings all the time.\n\nBut yeah it was a pretty tough recovery, and I went from just hanging out with a smile on my face to a scary place real quick. I went to a world-renowned clavicle specialist at Duke Medical for my collar bones. He normally had an insanely long wait list, but apparently when he found out that I broke both at the same time he was willing to see me ASAP. He told me that he'd only ever had a few patients that broke both at the same time, because the force required to do so almost always resulted in death. But eventually I got better, full recovery. Was a bit of a hypochondriac for a while, and was scared to cross the street for awhile. But other than that, no biggie.\n\nTLDR; I\u2019m a dumbass and didn\u2019t look both ways. The hospital is a dumbass too. ",

            "I fell down my friends basement stairs when I was 8 (hit my head on the concrete floor) and ended up being airlifted to a major city hospital after being knocked out and still screaming. Ended waking up a couple days later and found out I was missing a tooth and I was told that as they were putting a breathing tube in, it knocked my tooth down my throat which scared the docs more. But I was super happy cause I payed melee for the first time in the game room and ate jellow for meals.\n\n\nTurns out that I was actually in a comatose state and gradually got worse over 48 hours until I had 0 brain activity for about 6 minutes. So I guess I did die but I didn't find out from my family till afterwards, because who tells an 8 yr old that they died. ",
            "Not wearing a helmet while on a bicycle and stupidly turning left just as a car overtook me.\n\nSomehow I only got a neat scar through my eyebrow and some torn up kneecaps from it. But the look on my mother's face when she picked me up from the hospital...That made me realise how *profoundly stupid* I was that day.\n\nEdit: I did make a turn signal with my arm, but the driver apparently didn't see it. He later went over to the hospital to ask if I was OK and to apologise for hitting me."

She\u2019s older than me (25~), educated and a bit alternative. We agree to meet at a London pub for lunch at 1 in the afternoon which is quite a journey for me but I make it anyway.\n\nSo, she turns up a bit late with a baby in a baby carriage - I had no idea she had a kid before this but I didn\u2019t have a problem with it. She doesn\u2019t address that I didn\u2019t know about her kid but says she couldn\u2019t find babysitting. Cool. No problem. \n\nWe both go up and order a drink separately and hang out and chat. We\u2019ve been there for about 2 hours and she\u2019s gone up to the bar a whole bunch of times, mostly coming back with coffees and the occasional Coca Cola.\n\nBut then, quite suddenly, she falls forward on to the table and catches herself with her elbows and takes a big sigh and says \u201cOh man. I didn\u2019t mean to get so drunk.\u201d\n\nEr. What? I tell her I didn\u2019t realise that she\u2019s even been drinking but she tells me that she\u2019s been having Irish coffees, rum and cokes as well as shots at the bar. So at this point I start looking for an out but she\u2019s becoming more and more despondent and her 1 year old is sat in his pram so I can\u2019t leave in good conscience. I start encouraging her to get a taxi home and she starts to cry, apologising and saying that I must hate her. But shortly after she closes her eyes and will only respond in mumbles and groans. I try and get her to come around enough to get an address out of her which I can\u2019t, so I take her phone which wasn\u2019t passworded (2008 non-smartphones, most people didn\u2019t password their phone back then), find a contact called \u201cMum\u201d and call it.\n\nI was hoping she could come and pick her up but it turns out \u201cMum\u201d lives in the south of Spain. She isn\u2019t one bit happy to hear from me after I explain what happened, but presenting myself as a \u201cfriend\u201d. Nonetheless she gives me an address to get her to.\n\nI ask the bar to call me a taxi, which they do and one of the bar staff take pity on me and help me get the woman, the baby and the stroller into the cab.\n\nI was about to give the driver money for the trip and see them off but I realised that was a bad idea because who knows what would happen? So I get in the taxi to go take her home holding a baby the entire way, which I\u2019ve never done in my life at that point. Turns out the driver is a stand up bloke and I explain what has happened and we have a laugh about it. When we get there he even assembles the pram for me as I take her and place her on her doorstep.\n\nI find her keys and get her door open, at which point some guy pops his head round the corner from the kitchen and asks \u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d I tell him my name and that I\u2019m a friend and ask who he is, he says he\u2019s her fianc\u00e9.\n\nUh oh.\n\nHe\u2019s pretty angry that I\u2019ve \u201cgotten his fianc\u00e9 with his child drunk\u201d in the middle of the day. After getting the pram through the door he begins to carry her up the stairs and he says to me \u201cYou stay right there. You and I need to have a little chat.\u201d\n\nNOPE.\n\nAs soon as he turns the corner at the top of the stairs I turn and make a run for it, jump back in the taxi who I ask to take me to the nearest tube station.\n\nAfterward I needed some catharsis so texted some friends who were locals and went out proper.\n\nAnd the kicker? On the train home that night I get a text message from her:\n\n\u201cHad a lovely time. Can\u2019t wait to see you again.\u201d\n\nI block her number and never hear from her again.\n\nTLDR; went on date, date turns up with child and gets drunk without my knowledge, I drag her back to hers to make sure she\u2019s safe only to find she also has a fianc\u00e9 who is less than pleased to see me.",
            "Ok, so I was never a \"sporty\" kid in school. I come from the \"country\" parts of Ireland, where everyone has thick accents, drinks Guinness, and most importantly, everyone ***loves*** football. Of course, I was an antisocial fuck who never went outside, so I never learned how to play nor wanted to. \n\nSo one day in primary school, the teachers made us all play football. Since I didn't know how to play, I decided to just stand awkwardly near the goal and admire the scenery for the whole game. At one point I became so absorbed in doing absolutely nothing that I pretty much blocked out the sound of everyone else's voices, so I had no idea how the game was going. Towards the end of the game, I was getting rather tired, and was basically half asleep, when suddenly this ***fucking incredible pain*** hits my back. I fall over and I literally have no idea what just happened, when suddenly some of the kids on my team went over to me and started cheering and saying \"YEAH, (EGG!)\" \"GOOD JOB!\" I just kinda stood there for a moment before realizing what had just happened.\n\nApparently I had just accidentally blocked the opposition's winning goal by just standing there and doing absolutely nothing. \n\nTL;DR: If you want to accomplish your dreams and be praised, all you have to do is absolutely nothing.",

            "Got electrocuted my first day of high school.\n\nI was in a jazz band class that met before first period. Awkward teenage me new to high school and not great at bass guitar. Electric guitarist asks me to hold his guitar while he grabs some sheet music, I hold my bass in my left hand while grabbing his guitar with my right. The building we were playing in was built sometime in the 60's, and I guess it had some sort of faulty wiring. The next few things happened probably within 2 or 3 seconds:\n\nI instantly felt a weird sensation through my arms and chest, and my arms were visibly shaking. I remember trying to let go of the guitars right away, but my hands only gripped harder (electrical stimulation caused all my arm muscles to contract at once). I remember hearing loud feedback from both amps, and when I let out a sort of yelp it sounded like a loud, distorted version of my voice coming from the amps (everyone else just heard the feedback O.o). I passed out, briefly saw some popping blue lights, and woke up on the floor with blood all over my face and in my ear.\n\nApparently what everyone else saw was me vibrate and faint into my amp and onto the floor. My band director (late 50's) apparently moved like lightning to unplug the amp and probably saved my life.\n\nWhen I woke up I noticed the blood in my ear first and my first thought was that I had some sort of inner ear damage. It turned out I just smacked my face on the knobs of the amp on my way down. I tried to sit up, but my teacher told me to stay still until the ambulance arrived. Then I noticed all my classmates and sister (same class) looking pale and staring at me. The nurse came in and let me sit in a chair. I was holding a towel to my face when my mom burst into the room. Apparently my sister had called her and her mom instincts took over- she U-turned back toward the school (drove across some part of a lawn) and made it there before the ambulance. She insisted on driving me to the hospital where I got some face stitches and did some tests, but otherwise ended up fine. Really the worst part about the experience was not getting any super powers.\n\nThe whole band wrote a get well card full of puns about being SHOCKED to hear the story.\n\nAlso, both guitars were miraculously undamaged!\n\nEdit: spelling, forgot some details",

Like the child seat in the back. I was an 18 year old with no kids. I flip a u turn and bust ass back to work to hopefully get the car back before its owner notices its gone. \n\nI didnt. Cops were there and I was very quickly arrested. Owner dropped charges only after three things were done.\n\n1: I showed my keys unlocked and started her car. Then pointed to my car which was the same model, color, and year. \n\n2: one of my co-workers vouched for the fact that the customer parked in the spot I almost always parked in\n\n3: camera footage was pulled for the past 9 days I had worked showing that 7 of those days I parked in that spot and the other 2 I parked close to it.\n\n\n\nEdit: yall, the cops were doing their job and were polite about it because I cooperated. And the owner was right to be angry. I was a punk ass kid who in her eyes had just stolen her car. Or at least took it out for a joy ride.

She looks at it, smiles, and says \"okay\", and comes back with my beer.

            "PLEASE tell your doctor if your medications are too expensive. \n\nMy parents worked themselves to the bone and we ate like shit to help pay for medicine for me and my sister (hemophilia, we needed medicine to help clot during our periods)...they never complained and just worked - my mom didn\u2019t want anyone to know we were poor.  There were cheaper alternatives!! They could have saved thousands of dollars. \n\nI\u2019m a family doctor now and I make it a point to talk about medication costs and ask at all of my follow ups if things are affordable. We don\u2019t know what your copay is and it\u2019s not always easy to tell what will be covered on your plan. PLEASE let us know if something is too much, this is what we are here for! \n\n\nEdited to add hey thanks stranger for the gold and silver! That\u2019s a first for me. \n\nTo answer some recurring questions: \nI have Hemophilia C, which I like to call the off brand hemophilia because it\u2019s quite different than the more common ones. It\u2019s autosomal recessive, both of my parents are carriers. My two boys are carriers and one is symptomatic. The medication was Amicar oral solution. \n\n\nAnd as someone more eloquently describes in the comments below, prescribing the \u201ccheap\u201d medicine isn\u2019t always that simple. It depends on your insurance company, your deductible, which pharmacy you use (yes that matters!! Especially for psych meds), and if Jupiter is in line with Venus and the pharmacy gods smile down on us.  For some people $50 a month is reasonable and they would rather pay more for a long acting and other people can only afford $5 a month and are re-using supplies like lancets and catheters. \n\nI work in the US. If your medication is too expensive, and you have something other than Medicare or Medicaid try looking for manufacturers coupons (symbicort has a great one for 1 year no copays right now, and some of the newer long acting stimulants do too). Ask about local compounding pharmacies, mail order, three month supply or off label dosing...pharmacists look away... like you can use eye drops in your ears for an acute bacterial infections and sometimes they are significantly cheaper. I\u2019ve done that once or twice when patients just didn\u2019t have the extra cash to get the one designated for your ears.\n\nIf you need a procedure done and have a residency program or medical school local to you, see if they need any volunteers for didactics or demonstrations. We\u2019ve done ingrown toenails, warts, skin lumps and bumps for free during lectures to teach the other residents how to do them. \n\nTwo great sites: \nNeedyMeds.org\nGoodRx.com",

I look at her inquisitively and she just says, \u201cGo look, you\u2019ll see.\u201d \n\n\n\nI walk outside and it\u2019s pretty immediately clear the couple in the hot tub are \u201cdiscreetly\u201d having sex. \n\n\n\nI approach just enough to get their attention and say, \u201cHi guys, I know everyone\u2019s here to have a good time tonight, but we got a complaint about some hot and heavy activity in the hot tub.\u201d They\u2019re clearly intoxicated, but apologize and say it will stop.\n\n\n\nA few minutes later, the phone rings. It\u2019s the woman who complained before calling from her room which faces the pool. \u201cThey\u2019re still at it. You need to do something. Children are staying in this hotel.\u201d \n\n\n\nI go back outside and sure enough, now that the spectators are gone, they\u2019re fucking it out in the hot tub. \n\n\n\nI go back out, tell them to get out. They start giving me the story: it\u2019s their anniversary, they\u2019re very sorry, we won\u2019t have any more problems with them, etc etc. I foolishly let them stay in the hot tub. \n\n\n\n10 minutes later: phone rings. \u201cSeriously!!?\u201d Same lady. I look out the window, they\u2019re both totally naked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am, I\u2019ve warned them, I\u2019m calling the police. \n\n\n\nPolice arrive and head out to the pool. The officer handles it like a pro. He\u2019s very nice, let\u2019s them know that it\u2019s inappropriate, but he doesn\u2019t want to ruin what\u2019s clearly a fun weekend for them both, but they need to go to their room and not come out for the rest of the night. They are to stay in their room until tomorrow morning. No excuses. The couple thanks him for his understanding and promises they\u2019ll behave and stay in their room. \n\n\n\nThe officer and I wind up chatting and laughing about it all and he asks if he can grab a cup of coffee in our lobby while he fills out his report. Of course he can. \n\n\n\nHe\u2019s sitting in the Lobby, I\u2019m back to work, and I hear him say, \u201cOh, you\u2019ve got to be fucking kidding me!!\u201d I\u2019m shocked at the broken quietness as I see him jump up and exit the Lobby...\n\n\n\nRight to the hot tub, where the same couple is back in the hot tub making out. (I can only assume they took the stairs at the end of the hall out to the parking lot and around to the pool.)\n\n\n\nArrested them both. They came back Monday afternoon (they were arrested on Friday night) to collect their property. ",
            "A bear. \n\nFirst, you gotta understand that a lot needs to happen for this to occur. \n\nOur lowest floor, was still about a meter and a half from the ground, and each outside room had a balcony rail. \n\nHowever, a guest had decided to want to unload his motorcycle from his truck and leave the ramp down, so (I\u2019m assuming) he could ride the bike up when he was done. \n\nThe guest that was staying in the room had room service, decided to leave the food uncovered and the balcony doors open, and later went to the hotel pool/spa to relax. \n\nUpon returning, they had gone to us at reception and said that there was a bear in the room. \n\nPuzzled, we quietly approached the room and slowly opened the door. Lo and behold, there was a bear eating room service and making a mess of my afternoon. \n\nWe called Parks Canada to deal with it. \n\nGuest was not charged a cleaning fee. \n\nTLDR: a bear used a car as a ramp to get into a room at the property. ",
            "A bachelorette party came through and after they left the next night we had a new rule that charges a $400 glitter fee. But I mean you couldn't see the floor so much glitter. It's been a few years and you can probably still find glitter in the carpet throughout the hotel. ",
            "Woman with mysophobia (fear of germs) stayed with us. \n\nShe never let the cleaning ladies into the room as she preferred to clean it herself. One day she leaves to go out and removes the do disturb sign.\n\nMaid calls down and says the room has a strong chemical odor and found bags of pee and poop in the drawers. ",
            "Three guys in one room left ALL of their windows open and lights on overnight in the summer.  I have never seen so many different types of bug flying around the room, it was terrifying.  We ran in spraying bug killer like our lives depended on it, then ran out and left the room for an hour.  We can back to a floor that was almost black with dead bugs.  I can still hear the crunching.",
            "A little late, but I have two.\n\nFound bloody parrot feathers all over a room. They claimed it was service animal (it wasn't) and had gotten too stressed and pulled all of its plumage out. The guest tried to blame the hotel for noise. We charged them for the cleanup.\n\nWas balancing month end one day when the front was swarmed with police cars. They raided a room with no notice to us at the front desk. Turned out a pimp was cooking meth in one of rooms with two prostitutes and a dog. There was a short standoff before everyone was arrested. Their car was seemingly forgotten about in the parking lot, but it disappeared a week later. We were unable to charge for damages since all of their cards were stolen.",
            "I worked at a hotel a few years ago, front desk. I checked out a nice couple in the morning, they were very friendly, said they enjoyed their stay. Then housekeeping got to their room, the poor woman looked shell-shocked. I got to go through the room with a camera and my supervisor to document the state of the room. 2 large, black, double headed dildoes, lots of ziploc baggies with powdery residue, syringes (some used, some still with caps on them, including 2 in the toilet), and more travel sized bottles of baby oil than I could count. We also found what appeared to be feces and blood smeared all over the bedding and walls and a small digital camera. Police were called, descriptions of them taken, and all their information they had used to check in. I quit soon after, so I don't know if they ever found them or pressed charges.\n\n",
            "I\u2019ve worked night audit at a couple hotels for a few years now, and I\u2019ve got a couple of stories of nastiness left behind in rooms. \n\nThe first story happened about a week after I started working night audit. This guy who was staying on our first floor, had decided to go outside to smoke in only a towel. His towel apparently became stuck in the door, and in a genius move, he grabbed the smokers pole and busted out the window to his room.  When he climbed in, he cut himself badly enough that he bled all over the room. The shower curtain, bedding and a couple of pillowcases had to be sent out to be professionally cleaned, and the rest of the room had to be professionally cleaned. The hotel charged him with the cost of the window, the cost of the cleanings, and for every night the room was out of order, which was about a month. During cleanup, one of our houseman got cut by the glass in the window, and had to get treated in case of blood borne disease, and get stitches. The guest paid for all that too. The cost was around $10k for everything, and he was banned from the property forever. He tried to come in again about a year later with a third party reservation, and our GM personally waited for him and escorted him off the property. \n\n\nThe second story is about a man who we called \u2018Huge James\u2019. Huge James is literally the fattest man I have ever seen. He\u2019s pretty tall, and easily at 4-500lbs. In his room, are his wife, his daughters, and himself. The women in the family were all normal size. This family quickly developed a bad reputation with our pizza chains that delivered, because they would order a lot of pizza and never tip the driver. The drivers would come down and complain to me or other front desk staff about this. It got to the point where the dominos drivers would just give us the pizzas to take up to their room. Huge James and his family never let housekeeping in for about a week, and when they finally were allowed in, there was so much trash from fast food and pizza, that they had begun to stuff it under the beds. What is worse is that Huge James was physically too big to use the toilet in the room (we have rooms with reinforced toilets, so we absolutely could have accommodated him), so he had defecated in the tub. He then would use our nice white hotel towels to wipe himself, and just leave it on the floor. Nobody knew about the towels until our laundry lead, Miss Brenda (the sweetest and nicest little woman I know) found them herself. We had to throw the towels away, and we nearly lost Miss Brenda that day as well. While that was going on in the laundry room, one of our housekeepers was cleaning the room and noticed a towel tucked into the side of one of the beds. She pulled the towel out and a giant dildo came flying out with the towel. I saw the pictures of it, and end to end, it was almost as wide as the towel it was covered with. In addition to this, there were stains all over the mattress that had soaked through the sheets and onto the mattress. In the bathroom, the tub wasn\u2019t draining, and when they pulled the stopper mechanism out to try and clear the blockage, a lot of poop came with it, and that\u2019s how we knew they were shoving the poop down the shower drain. \n\nDuring this time, they had been staying on a third party reservation and making a new reservation every few days. When the new reservation popped up in our system after discovering what they had done to the room, the GM decided to evict them. Huge James came down and started screaming at the front desk supervisor about how the mess wasn\u2019t his fault and that it was retarded daughter doing all that, and making the messes, and defecating in the tub. Those were his exact words, and how he talked about his daughter if that helps you understand what kind of a person he really was. Everyone had met his wife and daughters, and they were really nice people, so we didn\u2019t believe him when he made claims that his daughter was the one making the messes. \n\nHuge James drove a lifted Hummer with huge chromed our rims, and the night before his eviction, I jotted down his license plate number in case he tried to pull something before he left (he did). When he found out that he was no longer allowed on the property, he trashed his room and smeared all the sauce packets from fast food and actual food on the walls, the tv, and the windows. They found food between the mattresses, and the bed frames had been broken. When it was time for him to go, we had police there to escort them off the property. After they left, all the damage was found in the room, and because I had the license plate number, they were found and charged with vandalism (I think) and we took them to court for the damage to room. It came out in court that it was actually him that was defecating in the tub, and he destroyed the room before they left. ",
            "I worked security for a while at a really large hotel. Two stand out in my mind. The first, a guest that went out by ambulance because of some \"allergic reaction\" (what the guest claimed at least). The room was full of black and bloody diarrhea. The smell was horrible, I have never smelled shit like that and hope to never again *gag*. The second wasn't something left but a assistance call. Elderly man was unresponsive when we got there. We used a defibrillator on him till the ambulance arrived and he actually survived. He came back to the hotel some months later to thank us, it was great. Most of those calls didn't end well so having one who survived and came back to say hey was nice. "

            "I know I'm kinda late here, and it's ANOTHER \"I'm not a cop, but,\" situation. But I'm kinda hoping this cop uses Reddit and will see this.  \n\n\nOne night I was coming home from a friends house, it was late (like 1 or 2 am), and their house is known for a bit of partying, and this was a relatively rural area so cops don't have much to do. I hadn't been drinking or anything that night and there wasn't a party. So, as I'm driving home down the windy back roads, I hit a skunk. Well, I didn't HIT it, it went basically right under my car and I heard a bit of a noise. I keep driving, but after 5 or 6 minutes, my AC starts pumping out the ***worst smell you've ever smelled.*** I know it's the skunk. I'm only like 10 minutes from home, so I try to stick it out. I roll down the windows and kinda stick my head out, Ace Ventura style. It's not working, the smell is overwhelming. Now, I have to vomit. I pull over, put my hazards on, and start puking on the side of the road. After a minute or so, a cop pulls up and puts his lights on. I'm still vomiting. He gets out and sees this mid-twenties dude with tattoos and a nose ring puking. As he's walking towards me, he starts saying \"Well, well, looks like maybe someone had a bit too much to drink toni- OH JESUS CHRIST WHAT THE FUCK!?\" As he's walking by my car he can smell the skunk. He starts dry-heaving and pukes a little bit, while through my vomiting I'm saying \"I - \\*hurl\\* - hit a skunk, I think - \\*hurl\\* - it's stuck in the undercarriage.\" We both kinda just back off until we can talk again, and then he helped me poke the skunk off of the bottom of my car while we both dry-heaved, using his extendable baton (nightstick? Do we still call it that?). Then once it was off he just kinda nodded and was like \"Ok good luck kid\" and got in his car, we both seemed pretty embarrassed.   \n\n\nWhoever you were, cop, sorry you didn't get the easy arrest you thought you had.

I was 13 and my appendix burst. It was so bad that the Dr's said when they went in to remove what was left they realized that the procedure was pointless because there was nothing left of it to remove. I went into septic shock so they had to flush me of toxins. Then my organs began swelling and I almost had complete organ failure. My core temperature shot up to 106F from the infections. I survived with a few small scars on my stomach and sizable chunks of my memory before that point wiped.\n\nThe dreaming during that time was random and ever shifting from one dream to the next. I would at time become lucid and realize I'd been dreaming for far too long and questioned if I were even alive. When my temperature spiked they put a ice blanket on me to help combat it. In my dream world I could feel it and everything froze like in The Day After Tomorrow.\n\nThat was 17 years ago and it's almost a daily thought. What if all of this is a dream? My progress and achievements, my wife and kids, all just products of my imagination trying to cope with being severed from the real world. If it were true, that all of this were a dream, I pray every day I never wake up to what reality really is. I'm too invested in this one.\n\nUpdate 2: seen a few questions asking me about my dreams. Look up a indie film called Waking Life. It has a similar feel to how the dreams were, minus the philosophy and add a bunch of weird stuff, people trying to kill me, a pig beast with scissor hands tying me under a press to be crushed only for right before it crushes me someone yells \"Cut\" and a stage crew unties me and I walk off stage and into another dream and a dream of being at my uncles house searching for Mountain Dew (a recurring theme) when everything gets frozen like the temp dropped to - 20F and when I touched my cousins frozen hand her fingers began snapping off.\n\nMy mind was fucked for a while after waking up.\n\nUpdate 3: My first Gold!

Code name \"Ol Faithful\" continues to sneeze at regular intervals of about 6 minutes. I'm pretty sure she was sneezing between the first two updates too it's just I was watching Captain America: The Winter Soldier and it's a pretty dope movie \n\nEdit 10:46 \n \nShe sneezed again and coughed right after. I asked her how she felt and she didn't answer so I was like if you're awake don't say anything so I'm pretty sure she's just mad at me. Or sleeping. I do have Captain America on pretty loud. And I've totally been staring at Scarjo's ass the whole time. But it's about more than that I think- she's ready for serious commitment that I'm just not sure I can handle right now (10:50 another sneeze/cough) I don't know I guess it feels like we're both going the same path in life and we have similar views and opinions and senses of humor and everything and we match each other perfectly but I'm just not sure. I don't know. I'm scared to be that open with someone. You let someone into your head and they judge you they can leave you and break you and it hurts man. It hurts. People are animals but maybe she's not. No she's definitely sleeping now.\n\nEdit 11:03 2/12/15\n\nShe's throwing up in the bathroom now, girlfriend has the flu. Shit is grossssss. For some reason I haven't gotten sick at all though even though I've been with her a lot, my mom thinks it morning sickness but also that's just my mom (I hope) Captain America still going strong. How can someone be happy if their two biggest fears are commitment and dying alone? I don't know what I'm doing with my life\n\nFuck\n\nEdit 11:18 2/12/15 \n\nShe just sneezed again. I'm signing off. This has been too self reflective for my taste and I try go long periods without acknowledging my problems directly. Thanks guys.",

Anyway, ran into her again at a friend's party when I was 28 and we hit it off.  She'd just gotten divorced from a two year marriage and I was just back from law school.  It was nice as we both knew the other wasn't a psychopath -- more or less got on with one another's families.

But we stayed in touch and actually started talking *more*--I'm talking constant Skype webcam and phone calls way too late into the night. Turns out I was one of the few people that actually bothered to put anything into a continuing relationship, and about a year after graduation she confessed that she had fallen in love with me.\n\nThat was seven years ago. We're getting married in 29 days.\n\nEdit: Aww shucks friends, thanks! I still sometimes get amazed we worked out the way we did.",
            "I would have.\n\nWe met in high school, I was a sophomore, she was a freshman. I student taught her Japanese class because a friend had done it for my class, and it was fun and a great experience for me. We bonded hard, and ended up dating. It only lasted a few months, but we stayed good friends, realized we were just better friends\n\n\nWe went every year together to the annual Cherry Blossom festival in D.C., and we always caught up. That trip, just for 3 days out of the year, was like a little time bubble - nothing back home mattered, none of the drama, the troubles, stresses that a high schooler could or would have, all of it washed away, and we got to spend 3 heavenly days together.\n\nThe first time we went together was when the marriage pact was made. At first, it was at 25. We settled on it, then a week later renegotiated to 30. Every year we reminded each other; every year made it more real for me, and something awesome to look forward to while simultaneously knowing we could still do what we wanted to before then. \n\nI graduated. We fell apart a bit. She went downhill a bit, pills and drinking, until she got pregnant at 18; I drank heavily and slept my way around trying to fix my crippling depression. I remember hearing about it. It didn't shatter my dreams of marrying her - if she was single at 30, kids or no, I was putting a ring on it. It never bothered me.\n\nKid 2 came a few years later. A few years after that, we bumped into each other and caught up. It was like no time had passed, and we done right back into our old friendship, incorporating all the things that has happened over the years. She was 24, I was 25. We spent the next two years trying to put a relationship together before the pact was due; it worked between us, but what didn't work was that we both has establishes, busy lives apart. I worked 50-60 a week, she was a full time mom and social services worker. We tried, we really did. But it always came down to \"Work needs me another night this week\", \"The kids are sick so I'm on full nurse duty.\" I loved her more than anything. \n\nShe died two months ago this coming week. We never got to carry through with our pact, but we'd gotten so close. My buddy moved up after a divorce; she was getting over a bad injury during her time in the military; time was again working against us. Then she was just gone. Blood clot from her lungs to her heart. And so it goes.\n\nI would have carried out the pact; I would have married her anytime between the past few years and 30. But I didn't. I beat myself up a bit for it, even if I had just had a few years to call her my wife. She'll always be in my heart, and that voice in my head that stops me from treating myself poorly. She has become my voice of reason, and maybe that makes me a little crazy, but it keeps her close to me, knowing full well I'll never smell her hair again or feel her hand on my face. \n\nShe was my Sunshine, and I was her Buoy. That'll never leave me. Maybe this wasn't the place for this post, but here it is.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to broadscope thank everyone who commented below; your kindness has found a wanting home in me, and I thank you all for it. I have made positive steps towards integrating her and our memories into my everyday step, but there are days where it is still hard. Thank you again.",

She is 6 years older than I am, (so 35 when this happened,) and apparently the guy she made the pact with was a Momma's Boy cranked up to 11. The TLDR version: made a marriage pact with someone she knew, watched her cousins and friends all get married and/or have babies back to back in the space of a couple of years, so they enacted their pact. Proposed Christmas Day, married on Valentine's, fast tracked a pregnancy. \n\nIn the first trimester things go south, Momma's Boy involves his mother in their marital squabbles who convinces him to leave his brand new pregnant wife. Wife gives the ultimatum: show up for the birth or stay gone. Guess who is back living with her parents with a new baby and a divorce in the works?",
            "I joined my high school graduating class in grade 11.  It was a rural school and most people there had been classmates their whole lives.  Come graduation and people were assigned partners for the graduation parade.  I was assigned to a beautiful young lady who had a boyfriend a grade below us, while I had a girlfriend a grade below us.  Some guys were ribbing me about my assigned grad \"date\" when another guy who was usually quiet spoke up and boldly stated, \"I'm going to marry her.\"  Everyone kind of just chuckled and we all headed to our next class.  I was very impressed when I reconnected with my old classmates on Facebook years ago and saw that he did indeed marry her and they have grandchildren."

            "So this has happened to me. I was lucky enough to find a beat up car for five hundred. I parked in a neighborhood that wasn't dangerous but it wasn't near any rich people or snobs. I slept in my car and went to the library and searched hard for a job. I went to food banks and got food stamps. I got a cooking job in a couple weeks. I didn't have any spending money so I just sat at the park or in my car until I got my job and in between shifts. Working in a restraunt or bar can get you cash everyday or the next day in the form of tips. \n\nI would also search Craigslist for a room without a lease or month to month and if they ask for a deposit just ask if you can pay in installments. \n\nIf you have a smart phone and service you can do post mates on a bicycle. You can also download the app called wag I think. Just type in dog walking app. Obama phone is still around and they give you a smart phone and free service. It's designed for people in your situation. \n\nI've never been to a shelter but I know they can be dangerous especially for young women. Actually women in general.\n\nDo you have any friends where you are? Family? May I ask where it is you live?\n\nEdit: I see you have a van. I would stay in there and save your money although looking for rooms ahead of time is a great idea. Job first, room second.\n\nA lot of people are telling you to buy a phone. Get an Obama phone dude. And first aid kits? You aren't hiking the PCT, you are in a short term situation.\n\nThe most important part it probably going to maintain as much of a positive attitude as possible and to go get a job.\n\nDo not buy a lawnmower to mow people's lawns that is terrible advice besides where would u keep it. Someone would steal that for scrap while you are sleeping.\n\nSeriously if you pm me I can walk you through this any day if you need advice. I have done this\n\nEdit: hey guys I'd appreciate instead of giving gold and silver if instead you would perhaps donate to shelters and food banks etc. Thanks and be safe on the streets things will get better if you work hard.",

At first it didn't seem like a big deal. It contained a note to each of his kids. It wasn't until I got to the last one, my youngest brother, that I realized it wasn't just a will. The start of that line read something along the lines of \"If anything is going to make me change my mind now it's writing this part\". I realized I had found my dad's suicide note. I was about 14 or 15 at the time and I had no idea how to go about talking to him about it. \n\nI decided to just keep it to myself. He started buying us gifts and stuff and I would get really scared and I still just kept it to myself. I remember one day on the weekend I woke up in my bed to a loud bang coming from my dad's room. I laid there in bed for probably half an hour frozen. Once I worked up the strength I went to his room and opened the door. \n\nHe wasn't in the bedroom. I was so confused until I saw that the bedroom window was open. What had happened is that there was a gust and the wind had slammed the door shut, but my paranoid brain had heard a gunshot. After that I was laughing hysterically and I don't have much memory of the day past that.\n\nShortly after this incident my dad had returned most of the gifts he bought us kids and I slowly started to believe that he had changed his mind. I never confronted him about it until last year, about 14 years or so later, but I never fully accepted that he was ok now.\n\nI called him distraught about a separate matter and he started talking to me about depression.

I can read upside down pretty well and it was very obvious that the figures she was recording had fuckall to do with the business we were doing.  We sold maybe $60 of golf fees a night, and maybe $100 in coin cups, but she was recording $600 and $1000 for each.  I commented on the discrepancy and quipped about how someone would think we were in the laundry business and she got *really* squirrely and told me to leave the office.\n\nThe next day the owner called me into his office and we had a very circumspect conversation about how much I was enjoying working there and enjoying the perks of the job, and I very much got the sense that he was trying to decide if I was going to tell anyone anything.  Apparently he decided I wasn't (and I wasn't), and so I kept working there.\n\nAbout a year later the owner was arrested for money laundering and we all got fired.  Still the best job I ever had.

            "When I taught ESL in Korea, I had a student who was a rage addict.  He was about 11 years old and this kid was grumpy like an old man.  He would hunch his shoulders and put his head down like some grumpy old codger.  Usually about once a month, he would lose his shit over something, and it was a volcano that would erupt for 20 solid minutes.  He would totally lose his shit, attack anybody who got near him, and would have no respect at all for adults.  I watched an older grandfather (somebody you totally respect in that culture) try to talk to him and the kid wouldn't back down, and in fact got even more angry until the grandfather lost it with him.  The kid had serious anger issues.  I would see the emotions rise in him over the course of the month break between fits and I could tell when it was about time for him to fly into a rage and explode.  \n\nAnother kid I taught came from a poorer family where the husband and wife constantly fought.  His father was an alcoholic and his mother was a snide, angry woman who ran a small produce stand in the neighborhood market.  The kid was purposefully belligerent towards authority in such a way you just never see in Korea.  Every adult I knew would just scratch their heads because they never understood him or how to reach him.  I tried everything I knew how to do in order to get through to him somehow or bond with him so I could teach him, or at least keep him from disrupting the entire class.  Even the other kids got tired of his shit.  But I knew it wasn't his fault and I felt bad for him, so I did what I could to show him kindness because I don't think he ever got much of that at home.

            "During my 20 years in the same school, it was just getting worse and worse. City wide, administrators were shifting accountability on to the teachers in order to preserve their own careers. This was the \"straw that broke the camels back\" for me. After this I knew that teaching, or trying to be a teacher in NYC schools was no longer worth the struggle for me. \nWhile I was supervising a class (not mine) during pack-up, clean-up at the end of the day, I caught two 7 year old boys on the floor hiding behind some furniture. One was giving a blowjob to the other boy. Shocked and disturbed, I reported it to my Principal and was simply told to call the parents. Incredulous, I asked what I should say, how should I handle this, why me, am I to do this alone? I was directed to be vague about it and if I wasn't vague and an investigation resulted, then I would be \"thrown under the bus\" because it must have only happened \"on my watch.\" Of course, the two boys were notoriously strange trouble makers for everyone, but nothing prior to this went on record. No one could make the case that the Principal had neglected to protect other children from these boys. When one of these boys picked at the gums in his mouth with his fingernails until his mouth was filled with blood and his smile scared the other kids; and his hands were covered in drying blood, he was sent to the nurse to wash his hands and rinse his mouth. The nurse sent him back to class with a note. The parents were told, but acted like it's just another day.\n\nEdit: a word\n",

When I went back to see what it was and he laughed and hid it, swearing he had nothing. I looked up to see him doing it again. Same thing happened... I let it go.\n\nAfter he left the room, I found the pen he had been writing with under his desk with two small incisions in the cap. I immediately reported it to admin.\n\nHe was moved to another teacher a few days later for an unrelated scheduling issue. He threatened to kill her. He was moved to another teacher because of this. In the third teacher's class, he drew pictures of rifles all over his essays. \n\nSo. Many. Red. Flags. He was finally sent to the alternative school a few months back. But he'll likely be back.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, the incisions on the pen indicated that he was using some kind of sharp object (a thumbtack, I suspect) to mime cutting my head off.

            "9th grade Honors English class. The teacher didn't like me. Only teacher I ever had that didn't like me (others would get frustrated with how my lack of effort at times, but still liked me as a person; she just flat out didn't like me). One of the reasons was that she didn't like athletes because they would miss her class regularly for travel for games. And I played 3 sports, so I was missing a good bit. Now, I was also missing for academic stuff like math/science competitions and quiz bowl tournaments, but she was particularly bothered about missing for sports.\n\nCase-in-point: She would intentionally double the amount of homework due the day after long away games knowing that the players wouldn't have the time to finish it all. And shocker, she didn't check homework every single day, but always checked after away games.\n\nI've written about her before, but she also would give me 70s and low 80s on papers without any red marks on them, but people around me would have red marks all over their paper and would have 90s. After one particularly low grade on an assignment that I knew I had actually done really well on, I inquired about it. Her exact response was that I was only doing 70% of my ultimate capability and the others were doing 90% of theirs. So I specifically asked, \"Does that mean my paper can be better than someone else's but be 20+ points lower?\" And she said yes. And to show this wasn't just me misunderstanding things, she recommended me for an advanced writing class a year earlier than students were supposed to be able to take it.\n\nSo if those two things weren't bad enough, she gave us an opportunity for extra credit toward the end of the year. We had to go to a local college's rendition of Antigone, write a 2,500 word paper on it and tie it into what we discussed in class on the play, and also turn in our ticket and play bill. It was due on a Monday and the play was only going on Friday-Sunday, so there was no way to turn it in ahead of time. But I was going to miss class that Monday all day for an academic competition, representing the school. And it was the biggest one of the year (like had to place Top 10 in a previous competition to qualify). So it's obviously an excused absence.\n\nI told her for an entire week prior to the play that I was going to miss on Monday, and she told me multiple times to turn it in first thing Tuesday morning. So I go to the play, write the paper, go to the academic competition Monday and place 1st in one category and 2nd in another, and then Tuesday morning before basketball workouts at 7am I go to her room to turn in the assignment. She refuses to take it because it's late, and she \"didn't recall\" ever suggesting that I could turn it in on Tuesday (she told me 4 times).\n\nHer reasoning: (1) Another student that missed for the competition was able to turn it in. But that student lived across the street from the school. I lived 20 minutes away and couldn't drive. (2) My mom was a teacher at the school, so I could have just sent it with her. Except I had been told to turn it in Tuesday, so there was no reason for me to think to have my mom turn in my assignment for me, plus she has her own students and classes to worry about. (3) I could have done the work Monday evening, which wouldn't be fair to the other students. So I went into the metadata for the paper that showed the last time it had been saved was Saturday afternoon. She still refused to grant me any credit for it. So I was out the $25 for the ticket, the time that it took, plus it really inconvenienced my mom who had to pick me up Friday from practice, rush me home to shower and change, then rush me back downtown for the play, and then come pick me up again 2 hours later. So my mom was pretty pissed about it, too.\n\nThis teacher also prided herself on the fact that nobody had ever made an A on her final exam. She thought she was the toughest teacher ever (really she just loaded students up with a bunch of busy work). So the last day of class she gave a few minutes at the end of class and asked \"What's your biggest wish?\" to the class as a whole. I piped up \"I wish for an A on the exam\" and she laughed and said, \"Yea and I wish for a million dollars and not to have to deal with you anymore.\"\n\nSo, all of that sets up the final exam. It's 100 questions and then a 5 point bonus question that asked those generic \"What was your favorite part of the class? What did you learn? etc.\" We got 2 hours to take the exam, and students that finished early had to wait until 1 hour was up so that there was just one point of people getting up and leaving rather than being distracting throughout. So I finished the 100 questions in about 20 minutes. So I spent the remaining part of the hour just blasting her in the bonus question.\n\nI said that I'm not sure I learned anything and pointed to her never making any comments on how to improve my writing. I said my favorite part of the class was it finally being over and not having to deal with her shit anymore and brought up a number of other little things that happened on top of that mentioned above. And I said that she was by far the worst teacher I had ever had and that the school is worse off with her teaching the entire 9th grade.\n\nThe bell rings for the hour and I'm the only person of the entire 110 students to leave at the hour mark. Now, on exam days the teacher doesn't proctor their own exam so that they are available to answer questions or if the classes are split among different rooms. So I have to wait for my mom to finish proctoring a different exam, so I'm just sitting out in breezeway. The teacher finds me, holding my exam, with tears in her eyes and tells me to meet her in the principal's office. She then storms off, so I head over. As I'm waiting there I recount what happened to the soccer coach who is sitting there cause he made some comment about \"surprised to see you sent in here.\"\n\nEventually she comes back in with my mom, who she pulled out of proctoring an exam, and we all go in to see the principal. She's crying, screaming, literally choking every minute or so. After about 45 minutes of me spilling everything I'd gone through that year (all things I'd already vented to my mom about plenty of times), the principal finally looks at her and goes, \"How much was the question worth?\" She said 5 bonus points, and he says, \"Then just don't give him the bonus points.\"\n\nSo I made a 98 on the final instead of a 103. Missed 2 questions. Every other student got the bonus points and the next highest grade was an 81.\n\nThinking she would get the last laugh, I noticed a few days before grades were due that one of my assignments from the second week of class all the way back in August had been dropped 10 points. My final grade ended up being a 94.4 which was a B at the time. But I couldn't prove that she had altered my grade, I just had them in all in a spreadsheet to determine my grade ahead of time (should have been a 95.2) but nothing that would prove anything, since I could have just typed it wrong (I didn't).\n\nThe summer after the school decided to change to a 10 point scale and so 90+ was an A, so my B became an A. She also had to have her homework assignments each week signed off by the department chair and she had to start accepting assignments via email. 2 years later she was fired after other students started having real issues with her. Prior to me the administration just thought it was a case of \"students complaining about the hard teacher.\"\n\nStill think she deserved every bit of it, but I certainly didn't think it would set in motion her getting fired. Though, again, she deserved it. Hopefully people are still reading. She suuuuuuuuuuuucked.",

I couldn't fall asleep without fears of waking up unable to breathe for about two years and I still got the scar where they put the tube through my ribs and into my lung to reinflate it.   Let me tell ya it was not fun lol\n\nTo expand on this. The first doc didn't put the lung tube in correctly. He was really shoving that thing into my ribs and I could hear the muscle and such tearing. I was quite fit at the time and had a ton of muscle. They also couldn't use the normal smaller tube because they were out so I got this thick tube. Yay me.  A day later I had a new lung tube put in. Because of that I was in the hospital for 3 days. My mom flew from Hawaii overnight to be there for me and I still couldn't thank her enough.  \n\nEdit: I don't have a 100 percent reason.

            "My grandmother was battling lung cancer. Me and my aunt were taking care of her. She was bedridden and close to the end, we knew that. One night I went to sleep and was woken up at 1am to the sounds of my aunt screaming my name. I rushed to my grandma's room and saw my grandma hemmoraging what looked like gallons of blood from her nose and mouth, while my aunt held her crying and screaming. I called 911, kept myself as strong as I could until they arrived a few minutes later and then I completely broke down. They pronounced her dead shortly after they got there. I've never felt more pain in my life than to see my best friend bleed out naked on the floor.\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all the kind words. And the silver (my first). This has definitely screwed me up mentally. It's been almost a year but I still dream about it every night. Sleep is a total nightmare.

            "The grocery store I work at already donates a lot to the local food bank. Many try to donate as much as they can because the company can use the donations as a tax write-off. We also donate to several local schools and group homes.\n\nAnd most all the perishables that can't be donated are collected and composted by a local farm, not trashed.",
            "I would feel enraged.\n\nHere's why. I work with a food bank and with grocery stores to pick up their bad food. Grocery stores make a lot of donations. Lots of good usable food goes to the food banks and I pick up what can't go there. I go to the food bank and I pick up what grocery stores donate to them that SHOULD HAVE GONE IN THE GARBAGE. There's moldy food and there's expired food that the food bank just has to get rid of. \n\nNow you think \"no big deal just throw it in the trash\" except in any decent sized city this is literal tons of food every single week that has to get thrown away. Literally thousands of pounds of rotten food that was either donated or went bad before it could be distributed. This isn't just \"throw it in the trash \" amount of food. This is \"we have to make a special trip to the dump\" amount of food. This costs a CHARITY hundreds if not thousands every single year.\n\nLet me tell you who the worst offender here is. Walmart. Walmart will donate almost anything to a food bank so they don't have to pay to get rid of it. I have gone through PALLETS of rotten food from Walmart. Fuck you Walmart. Fuck you. \n\n\nTLDR: it's a bad idea. ",
            "That\u2019s complicated because the food they can\u2019t sell gets taken off the shelves when its almost expired, and only rarely did other reasons. If this was the law food banks would be inundated with old food that they\u2019d have at best a few days to disperse before throwing it out themselves. I\u2019ll bet that a law like this would result in more hassle for food banks than is worth. ",
            "There shouldn't be laws to require them, but there could be incentives to encourage it. Most likely though, if a store is going to throw out food then the shelter probably wouldn't take it anyhow. The shelters do have standards they have to meet when it comes to accepting donations. They often discard donated food that has passed its printed expiration date.\n\nEDIT: Grammar hard.",

            "Used to work at a grocery store (major chain store)  in really ghetto part of town. The way customers handled our food (such as opening it, taking a bite, closing the package, and putting it back on the shelf) would make me more inclined to trash leftovers rather than give them away. I had good eyes when scanning the shelves for unsellable things, but it\u2019s impossible to catch everything. \nHave also found dirty diapers stuffed in the very back of shelves or buried in produce displays. \nHave seen people break the seal on milk to open it and smell it, then put it back on the shelf. \nHave also seen customers take perishable foods (like meats), decide on the way to checkout that they didn\u2019t want them, and just throw them in random (non refrigerated) places in the store. Some of that meat, if employee finds it & determines it is still cool enough to the touch, goes back in the cold case in the meat dept for someone else to buy. But as a customer  I would still not buy it if I knew that it had been sitting out. Or want to give it to a food bank. \n\nPeople are pigs. ",
            "A legally required donation isn't a donation. ",
            "Well, who is required to do the transportation? That's a lot to throw on the grocer. \nI'd the non-profit going to pickup? Well, they can't make the time, not food is expired. Who is held liable?\n\nAlso, you often don't know what isn't going to sell until it doesn't sell. \n\nIt might also change how they re-use foods. For instance the hot deli chicken that doesn't sell is reused for chicken salad. \nSo, did the hot chicken not sell, so it goes donated?\nSame with the cinnamon buns, often reused to make bread pudding. How does the law see that?\n\n\nWhat if the place is just flooded with low quality cakes? Do we really want to serve a needy population old junk food? \n\n\nWhile the idea is on the surface, fine. Stores aren't generally tossing out perfectly good food. It's a terrible good business model. \nThis regulation would put a lot of undue burdens on the small stores operating with small profit margins. ",

            "Compelling people to be good via force doesn\u2019t make people good.  I think it would be great if they donated their edible food as most food they can\u2019t sell is inedible, but forcing them to do so is wrong. "

He was a small boy, pale with dark hair.\n\n\nEventually, Adam stopped showing up all together.

            "When I was 7 or 8, I would have a reoccurring nightmare that one of my dolls came to life, played with me, and then would try to pull me into my closet with her.  I\u2019d follow her into the closet at first, but then she\u2019d show me this little door at the back of the closet, and my heart would start to race. I don\u2019t know what it was about that door, but I knew something bad would happen if I went through it. I\u2019d start to struggle and try to pull away, but the doll was too strong and would start pulling me through the door. At this point in the dream, I\u2019d always wake up screaming. The worst part was I had night terrors, so sometimes I\u2019d wake up standing next to my closet. Every night before bed, I\u2019d make my parents make sure there wasn\u2019t a little door at the back of my closet. There never was. \n\nAnyway, I was talking to my mom the other day and this dream came up. I\u2019m laughing about it and how ridiculously paranoid I was about dolls and that closet, but my mom gets really quiet. She tells me the creepy part of that dream wasn\u2019t the doll; it was the fact that there used to be a little door at the back of the closet, but when I was one year old, they remodeled the house and put a wall where the door used to be. There\u2019s no way I could have remembered that door, but years later, I kept dreaming about it. \n\nNone of my friends believe this story, but I swear it\u2019s true.",
            "I grew up on a 2 acre home with plenty of trees and room for an 8 yr old to run around. Our house also was heated in winter by a wood fireplace, so we would periodically cut down one of our own trees to save money. Well for about 2 years, there was a stump less then a foot tall near the house, and at least once a day, without fail, I would see someone standing on the stump. Usually it was out of the corner of my eye, but once or twice I looked directly at him. I always looked away quickly, cuz it startled me and he was gone, but my sister says she experienced the same thing. Nothing ever came of it tho",

            "Alright, buckle in. \n\nMy neighbor was dying of a heart condition about 6 years ago. He knew he was, so he was giving away his valuables to people he trusted with them. Neighbor gave me his tackle box. He loved to fish. I would see him come home from fishing every day and he\u2019d just sit on his porch and skin fish. I just put the tackle box in my closet and didn\u2019t really do anything with it since I don\u2019t fish. Anyways, soon after, he passed away in his home. Exactly a week after that, I woke up to the tackle box at the foot of my bed. Weird, but my stepdad likes to dick around, figured it was him, so I put it back. The next morning, I wake up, it\u2019s at the foot of my bed again. So, I ask my stepdad what the deal was, and he had no idea what I was talking about. To test this, I put the tackle box in a spot that he wouldn\u2019t find, nor would he attempt to get it. Under my bed, all the way in the back against the wall, and I put stuff in front of it to conceal it. Next morning, nothing. Okay, I guess it was him. Didn\u2019t give it much thought after that. 3 days pass, I wake up one morning and there it is, at the foot of my bed. Fuck. Now i\u2019m starting to freak out. So I did what any rational person would and I went fishing with it. After I went fishing, I put the tackle box away, and it hasn\u2019t moved since then. It\u2019s still there.",
            "About 8 years ago now I was taking a drive out to Kansas from the east coast. I was with a friend and we were going out to see her grandparents. Once we were about 2 hours from the grandparents house my friend starts outlining standard operating procedures of \u201cseeing things\u201d in and around her family\u2019s home. She seemed a bit panicky when going over everything but I managed to calm her down.  I\u2019m skeptical of everything and assured her that the things she had seen when she was a small child were just manufactured in her imagination. She insisted that the entire family had seen these \u201cthings\u201d with the exception of her grandparents. \n\n2 hours later, we arrive in Kansas and I\u2019m ready to fall over because of the length of time the last leg of the trip took. We are welcomed and grandmother takes me to a back bedroom and just as she about to close the door; she stops, says \u201cmaybe you shouldn\u2019t stay in this room\u201d and escorts me to another room. Ok, that was a little strange but whatever, I\u2019m tired. \n\nFast forward to night #2 at the grandparents home. It\u2019s around 11pm and my friend is crashed out on the couch watching tv. I\u2019m in an adjacent bedroom from which I can see her laying on the couch. I nod off for the night and wake up to a old grey man that bared a resemblance to the grandfather but was not the grandfather standing with his back to me in the doorway looking at my friend sleeping on the couch. I decided I was going to get up and confront the old grey man and something slammed me back into the bed. I tried to get up several more times with the same result. Each time I was slammed back into the bed a voice would repeat \u201cput a seal on the door\u201d \n\nFinally, I snapped to it\u2019s 3 am and everything was normal. I must have been sleeping. It was a dream. No old grey man and my friend was fast asleep. So I start pacing around the room trying to decide how I feel about what had just happened. I glance over to my friend her eyes are open and she says \u201cyou seen it\u201d.  I say, \u201cget in the car, I can\u2019t be here right now.\u201d \n\nWe spend the next 4 hours sitting in a Walmart parking lot talking about the history of her experiences in that house and comparing to my own. Ok, my nerves are not on fire anymore and we are heading back to the grandparents home. We arrive and they are waiting for us inside. I tell them exactly what happened to me and I get \u201cyeah, that\u2019s strange. We usually do seal our doors with a prayer at night but with all the excitement we just must have forgotten. All the children have mentioned stories of things but we have never seen them. We are sorry you had to go through that\u201d.  \n\nI\u2019m really not sure what I seen or experienced that night but when I tell people they get that look of skepticism. It\u2019s obvious they don\u2019t believe me. My conclusion is that the experience was indistinguishable from reality in the moment. I don\u2019t know what that means but it changed the way I look at things.",
            "This makes me sound fucking crazy but anyways:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a warm summer morning back when I was a kid. I was standing in our hallway, putting on my shoes when I randomly peeked into our living room and saw a see-through male figure surrounded by rainbow coloured light standing right in the middle of the living room. He was reading a book and didn't seem to notice me. I thought it was weird but I didn't feel scared or anything. It felt like the room was filled with a warm, loving energy if that makes sense. I kinda just shrugged it off and went about my day, probably because I was too young to really understand what I'd seen. A few days later when my mom tucked me into bed she read me a bedtime story about a kid who meets an angel or something like that, don't remember the story exactly but what is interesting is the authors description of what that angel looked like. It was exactly the same as the strange rainbow man I had seen in our living room a couple of days before. It even said that angels will often visit humans surrounded by a strong, rainbow coloured lightening and manifest themselves while reading a book*.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI casually blurted out:\"*Oh, I've seen an angel then!\"* and my mom was like:\"*You have? That's great!\"* and we didn't talk more about that for a while until one day where I randomly asked my mom if I could see a picture of my grandad who died unexpectedly while my mom was pregnant with me.She found an old family album and we looked through pictures of my parents' wedding that happened exactly one year before I was born. There was a picture of three or four people sitting together, laughing and having a great time at the party. I immediately pointed out the guy who sat in the middle and said:*\"How funny! He looks just like the angel I saw!!\"* and my moms face turned white as a ghost. She was just about to tell me that this was indeed my deceased grandfather who I never got to meet. I'm very convinced it was him visiting me."

Well one day on Skype he told me that he liked the taste of his own cum. And that he liked to cum in his own mouth. Being completely fascinated by people I of course asked how that was possible.

I remember when IED's first became a thing, ambushes on the road and getting mortared. I was hyper vigilant everyday. My perspective on Iraq and the mission there quickly became cynical. I began developing negative opinions about the Iraqi people. But then, we rolled through Erbil.\n\nUnderstand that the Iraqi Arabs do not like the Kurds at all. It seems it was the only thing Iraqi Arabs could agree to. The Kurds were isolated. So when we rolled through, we encountered a purely Kurdish welcome.\n\nWe heard rumors that the peshmerga may attack us, we were on alert and rolled into the city. I'm the turret gunner of my vehicle and I'm tense, ready for anything. What I encountered was something surreal. The Kurds welcomed us as if we were on parade... I can only compare it to the documentaries I've seen about the allies rolling into Belgium in WW II. Women gave soldiers a kiss on the cheek, men gave hugs, people threw flowers at me. The peshmerga met us and gave us everything we needed. I ate with locals in the town without my body armor, it was like we left Iraq and entered some other county that was waiting for us.\n\nThe Kurds gave us protection, hospitality and overall courtesy.\n\nEdit: my first awards.

I kept asking him if he was alright but he kept saying everything was fine.\n\nOn the second day he came up to me and asked me how to do something that I know he knew how to do, I had trained him on how to do it. I became very concerned at this point. The 3rd day was new years eve so we only had a half day and he was working on a spreadsheet. End of the day came around and I took one look at it and I could have printed it out and called it modern art, that's how horrifying it looked. I called the boss over and he pulled him off of it which caused my friend to break down and start crying because he couldn't understand that he had done anything wrong. I was moving to a new place over our day and a half off so I simply told him that something was wrong with him and he needed to get some help. \n\nWe came back in for one day on Friday and my friend wasn't there. I learned that he was in the hospital because of a heart attack. Later on we learned that during the days leading up he was suffering from mini strokes and that all of my constant nagging about if he was alright ultimately led to him thinking that maybe there is something wrong with him and so he called a taxi to take him to the ER on new years eve where they immediately recognized that he was having a heart attack. A doctor later told him that if he had not gone to the ER when he did he would not have woken up if he had gone to sleep that night.\n\nBecause of this my friend says that I saved his life through the power of our friendship.",

I got home and all these kids were standing near my door (apartment complex next to a pond) and they were all staring at me and not saying anything. I went inside and dropped my bag and it wouldnt stop weighing on me how weird it was so i went back outside. I spoke to them asking what was going on and one kid meekly asked if I could help his friend. A kid I didn't see was sitting on a curb surrounded by all the rest. They had all jumped the fence next to the pond, except he slipped and impaled the flesh of his inner thigh and got stuck, the kids helped pick him up off of it, but he was just sitting there bleeding everywhere with a bunch of meat hanging out. I got him treated and ambulance on the way, he came back a few weeks later with his family to thank me, said I saved his leg.    \n\nEDIT: fixed a cell phone typo.   \nThere were 6-7 kids who all just followed me with their eyes without any sound (no talking, no shuffling, no kid sounds)  as I walked down the sidewalk, that\u2019s what freaked me out. The kid in question was sitting on a curb in between them facing away so I didn\u2019t notice him. When I asked what was going on they parted like the Red Sea showing me that kids back. He was in shock and asked me if he needed help and then lifted his shorts leg. Everyone was eerily calm about the whole thing. However once lights and sirens came they scattered to the 4 winds.    \n\nThe railing was made of 1/2\u201d steel tubing. The top had a horizontal runner about 8 inches from the top of the picket. Each picket was 4\u201d apart and the tops of each picket were pinched together flat then the edges were folded in, creating a spear but without any barbs. This created a place to put your foot to hop the fence produced you didn\u2019t slip.  So luckily it was smooth in and smooth out. What\u2019s horrifying and I never thought of until now, is that how he skipped the fence and how he had to fall to impale his thigh means he hung there with all his weight on it. Jesus.",

And I could see him clearly, like 20 years later it's still so vivid.\n\nHe pulled out some gloves and put them on which is the last thing I saw him doing as I got out and ran through their garage out the front, and inside my house next door terrified. He drove around the front down the street slowly and about 10 minutes later shot 2 kids at the park at the end of my street.",

            "Before my husband and I were married with good jobs we were young and poor and didn\u2019t care where we lived.. we rented out a shitty little house behind the landlords house that was clearly a shed poorly transformed into a small studio space. At the time I worked late nights and my husband worked mornings so I would sleep till around 12 and work all night. The landlord, Greg, was this bald old man with a heavy Russian accent. He was kind of odd but seemed nice. So was his wife. He\u2019d made odd comments and invite me into his house to FaceTime (at the time it was a different program I can\u2019t remember what the OG online face chat was) with his friends in Russia. One time I complained the chipmunks were crawling into the roof, asked to patch it up better and he said \u201cBaah no need, I take care\u201d and I swear to god he would snatch them up with his bare hands and break their necks. I wish I was making that up. Weird, he made me feel uneasy but seemed kind to us. \n\nWhen we first moved in I kept waking up feeling uneasy when I should\u2019ve been exhausted. I\u2019d feel nervous and get up check the doors, check closets ect. \n\nOne week my husband went away to visit his father and I was alone and literally felt like I was constantly being watched. The bedroom window was back in the yard and it was heavily wooded, I\u2019d hear crunching of leaves and foot steps all the time. My husband said I was being paranoid because I was alone and I thought so too.\n\nBut then that same week my husband was away I offered to watch my friends dog. So I get home from work around 2am and get to sleep around 3-4am. I wake up around 8-9am to the dog barking and growling like a made man. Now, because the space was similar to a studio we had no doors on anything besides the bathroom. I spring up, and see Greg the landlord literally in the living room, hand on the front door just frozen. He was caught off guard by the dog and I yelled \u201cwhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d I thought the house was on fire or something, and I know the front door was locked. I always locked it. He quickly apologized and walked out. When I shook from my sleepy daze I realized maybe this wasn\u2019t a one time thing, I took a shower, dressed and walked up to their house. Greg\u2019s car wasn\u2019t in the driveway but his wife was home. I told her what happened and asked why Greg would use his keys to go in the house without giving me notice. She was nonchalant about it and replied \u201cit\u2019s his house he can do what he want. He like to check on things from time to time\u201d \n\nI flipped out on her. Clearly this was happening often and the eerie feeling I was getting im 10000% sure was Greg literally coming in the house, watching me sleep completely invading my privacy when he knew I was alone and asleep. We noped the fuck out of there as soon as we could. He actually tried to take us to small claims court for breaking the lease but I had already reported him to the police and found out the space we were renting wasn\u2019t even up to code or on the books to be rented.

            "When I was 15, I hung out with some friends after school and got a ride home that night. No one had been home all day, so there were no lights on inside or out. The friend that drove me home didn\u2019t stick around to see if I made it in, so as I\u2019m starting to make my way up the walkway to the front door, I sense someone waiting to meet me there. I calmly stop after taking a couple steps and say \u201cNope!\u201d loud enough for the potential criminal to hear me, then briskly turn around and walk swiftly down the street, cut through a neighbor\u2019s backyard to get to the next street over, make my way to the nearest pay phone, dial the police and tell them I think there\u2019s someone trying to rob the house. I get back when a police officer arrives and he shines his flashlight around the door and sees footprints in the snow leading from around the house. He follows those and sees they are around the entire house. There was in fact, someone waiting for me to open the door that night. I laugh at the thought of their surprise to have some teenage girl acknowledge them from a distance and tell them not today."

Knowing thousands and thousands of strangers have heard the story of your violent conception and empathize with the woman who never wanted her baby is fucking awful. Hearing someone say \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you had to experience this\u201d while I\u2019m standing RIGHT THERE without it even occurring to them to have empathy for me, makes me feel I don\u2019t deserve empathy.\n\nI look and sound so much like her (I\u2019m an actress and also a public speaker of a different genre) that I had to move away from my hometown and friends (my only real \u201cfamily\u201d) so I would stop being approached with questions about my childhood, my father or being complimented on my incredibly courageous mother. I never wanted to ruin her success, as I was The One Person who would ever know her as an emotional abuser.\n\n\nI\u2019m 41 now. I have a lot of support and help these days- therapy, meds. But I am alone on most holidays, like yesterday so it\u2019s really really hard to stay alive. May 18, 2017 was my most recent semi-colon day. It\u2019s the longest I\u2019ve gone between attempts.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if maybe this doesn\u2019t quite fit the question or is wildly inappropriate. But the stories about people experiencing illness and still showing up for work only to get other people sick is what made me think it could be a metaphor for my life.\n\n\nSorry if this isn\u2019t the answer you were expecting. And I\u2019m writing by iPhone so I also apologize for formatting.\n\nI\u2019m always going to feel sorry for existing.\n\n\n\nEDIT: the outpouring of support has been unexpected and incredible. I 100% expected my comment to be taken down. I\u2019ve never publicly told this story before, and if you can believe it, my childhood outside of that particular trauma was no short of cinematic. Which is why I never talk about my early life- its too sensational.\n\nTo those who have suggested I reach out to my mother for closure:\nWhen I was 16 she started a small, therapy-based non profit that helped victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse, trauma etc. find a safe place to heal. Since then, it has turned into a huge organization, that now includes assistance and housing, support for the LGBTQ community, helps rehouse transgender youth that has been forcibly displaced. They have block parties, fundraisers, concerts. She won Woman of The Year a few years back for all her work. And all of these accomplishments are rooted in the strength she gained from her experience.\n\nSo I just don\u2019t think I can. Can I? \n\nCan I confront her about this?\n\nI want her to stop repeating what is also MY story in front of thousands of strangers at a time. It\u2019s private. It prolongs my abuse and subsequent healing.\nHealing that would be at the expense of literally thousands of others... To confront her as an abuser... would I even get what I actually need from that conversation? How can I weigh the value of a single life\u2019s right to self worth and joy against thousands of others??? ",

Why not 100?\"  If I start at 100, I hear Bono's voice from the Rattle And Hum version of Bullet The Blue Sky, saying \"Slappin' 'em down...  100...  200...\" which eventually leads to \"Am I buggin' you?

            "**TL;DR: Narrowly avoided being sent to prison for 10-20 years for several drug crimes and instead paid minimum fines due to some quick thinking and taking a huge risk**\n\nLate to the party, but:\n\nWhen I was in high school and the few years after, my primary source of income was selling pot. One day I was just hanging out at home with the GF. We went to the Circle K a few houses down and got some beer. The clerk, who I knew pretty well at this point, asked if he knew where I could get a dub sack. I said sure and that I'd be back soon. \n\nI go home and forget about it. An hour or two later I'm like oh shit, remember, weigh it out and go back. He had already given me the money (very important detail for later), so I waited until he had no customers. He came out and we went around the ice box, just smoking and chatting. I handed him the bag.\n\nNow, there was no one around. Empty lot except for this beat up Volvo facing the record store next door. If I had been paying better attention, I may have noticed this Volvo had completely tinted windows which seemed odd to do on a beat up Volvo.\n\nTwo men get out of the car and approach us. One tall skinny guy wearing 100% denim and another guy who looks like Dog the Bounty Hunter in a beige sweater. They approach us and ask how we're doing. Me and Clerk look at each other like \"..you know these guys?\" Then all of a sudden, the flash badges and yell \"EPD!! YOURE UNDER ARREST!!\" and cuff us, separate us, and search us. Beige Dog goes through my texts, finds a couple dubious ones, a few crumpled up 20's, starts trying to get me to admit to \"doing a lot of business today\" blah blah. \n\nThen they surprise me by walking me and my GF back to my porch, saying they've seen me come and go quite a bit and just want to \"make sure you don't have a pound of heroin in there\" and they'll just charge me with a misdemeanor. Otherwise, it will be jail and a felony. \n\nSo here we are, on my front porch, me saying there's no way I will let them in my house and to call my lawyer over and over. At one point, my roommate walks out, says hi, gets in his car and leaves. At this point, Dog explains that if I don't let him search the house, he's going to park a few squad cars on the lawn, extract everyone from the house and wait on a warrant and they will charge everyone in the house with every little thing they find in any room.\n\nI now know this is not legal. Then, I was just scared. My roommate that had just left was a total nerd with a great job. Straight edge. Rarely drank and never smoked or anything at all. I was terrified of him losing his job.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I had just had an opportunity to get a quap of mushrooms at a steal of a deal. My area was super dried up on mushrooms at the time, so I asked around and basically had all my deals set before I got it. This timing was perfect, because just 30 feet away on the coffee table of my bedroom was 1/4 of a lb of mushrooms, neatly weighted out into ounces and 1/8's. Top that with all the pot in there... it wasn't looking pretty.\n\nSo, I proposed that I let one of them in to search just my bedroom and be done with it. I knew once I let them in they could do whatever, but I was out of options. \n\nBeige Dog agrees. Canadian Tux stays with my GF (who looks TERRIFIED like \"WTF ARE YOU DOING\" at me) and Dog the Sweater Hunter enters with me. I lead him upstairs, and walk right past my door (which thank god was closed) and... into the straight edge guy's room.\n\nDog completely turns it over. Takes out drawers. Turns the mattress over. The whole shibang. As he does this, I quietly turn off the computer monitor with a background of my roommate and his gf glaring on it.\n\nGuy finds nothing, sticks with his agreement and walks me and my shit eating grin back downstairs. My gf, probably assuming I'm going to prison for many years, is looking like she's about to die, but I'm just grinning. \n\nGuy *still fucking charged me with a felony.* Then they leave.\n\nLong story short, paid a lot for a great atty who was friends with the prosecutor. Since no money was seen to be exchanged, the charge was knocked down to \"deliverance of marijuana.\" The prosecutor recommended the minimum sentence. \n\nI paid an $121.00 fine, did 80 hours of community center at a local music venue, saw a ton of shows for free and retired from selling.\n\nGod I hope someone reads this.",

About 2 years ago, I worked at a healthcare facility where I would float to different offices around the county based on who needed the help. This one particular morning I was checking the doctors schedule and saw my fathers name. He was scheduled to be in the office next door to where I was working and I thought it was pretty crazy but I most likely wouldn\u2019t even see him. The time of his appointment came and he walked into my office straight up to me and says he had a Drs appointment with Dr X.

            "3-4 years ago.. I was living in this bigger european city (~2mil people) for some years now. I went with a girl to a pub - and since all tables were full, we sat at the bar. There was an older guy sitting next to me (50ish, white hair, smoking a cigar) who kind distracted me - because he reminded me of my uncle.\n\nNow mind: My uncle was living in the US for around 25 years already, he didn't look like that dude, nor did he act too similar. That bar guy just had some gestures that reminded me of him, mixed with the look of another distant relative.\n\nSoo... The girl i was with goes to the toilet, so i can't hold back anymore an look this dude in the eyes and tell him he reminds me of my uncle. He jokingly asks: \"what's his name\". I tell him, and also tell him \"weell.. he lives in the US and works in [field_of_work]\"\n.. and then the guy looks stunned and tells me the names of my whole fucking family.\nTurns out he was the flatmate of my uncle 30yrs ago for about half a year.\n\nThat was defenitely one of the weirdest bar stories i experienced!\n\n\n\nTL&DR: went to bar in big city - guy reminds me of my uncle. I tell him. Turns out he was my uncles flatmate 30 years ago for half a year. Uncle lives on another continent for 25 years now.",
            "So me and my brother are fraternal twins. My step mom passed away due to breast cancer when we were around 15 years old. She was like a 2nd mother to us and had been around since we were very young (5 years old). \n\nNow fast forward to our junior year of college. I attended a school in upstate NY while he attended a university in the state of Florida. One night I woke up in sweat with tears coming down my eyes. I had the most vivid dream. I was in a house and my step mother was there. I knew she had passed in this dream, which was a first for me. She hugged me, told me  how handsome I had become, and that she loved me. I woke up drenched in sweat thinking \u201cwtf was that\u201d. I didn\u2019t say anything to anybody and went to class. \n\nAs I\u2019m walking back to my apartment after class, I get a call from my brother. His first words were \u201cI know this is going to sound weird but I had the most vivid dream about Maggie last night\u201d. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as he went on to describe the same dream I had just experienced the night prior. \n\nWe\u2019ve never had a twin moment like this and I don\u2019t really know what to make of of it, But it\u2019s always been a story that I wanted to tell.

            "Was served lunch sometime during a flight. While eating, noticed that the women next to me is slowing down in her movements, slower cutting, slower chewing, etc. \n\nSuddenly she stops completely in her movements, fork and knife in hands, half cut food on her plate, face bowed forward above her plate and nothing else. \n\nTouched her on the shoulder, pushed a little bit, asked her if everything was okay, no reaction. Couldnt really tell if she was still alive. Was it the air conditioning or her breath? No idea. \n\nDidnt want to panic and frighten everyone else. You know. Dead person. Made eye contact with a stewardess, point towards next to me. Couple minutes later, five stewardesses including co pilot form a barrier around our seats and like in a movie tried to get a reaction aka \"dont you die on me\"...\n\nWoman wakes up, looks up and says just this one sentence: \"I took  really strong sleeping pills.\" AND GOES BACK TO SLEEP IN THE SAME TYRANNOSAURUS POSTURE! As if this has happenend before, and she had anticipated this conversation, as if she knew that her mind would be only be awaken long enough for one sentence!\n\nSo for the entire remaining 6-7 hour flight, there is this lady next to me, mimicking a tyrannosaurus, her hands still grabbing the now removed fork and knife, drooling on the table.

            "I saved a man's life, and I never saw him again. 10 years later, this is still the craziest thing that has ever happened to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn high school, I worked as a lifeguard at a country club for a few summers to earn some money. It was a cushy gig. It was for country club members only, so a large part of the job was learning people's names and interacting with them. Mostly just saying \"Good morning Mr. Gerrity!\" and listening to some generic mumbling about millennials.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, over the fourth of July weekend, there were more people at the pool than usual--each member could sign in one guest--and there was a middle aged man jumping off the diving boards who I hadn't seen before. He was over 6 feet, at least 230 pounds and was doing \"gainers\" off the low dive into the pool to make big splashes to impress his country club member friends. Well, one particular jump he got a running start and slipped off the board at the very end. His momentum was already leaning backwards to do the jump and his body came off the board a few feet and his head rotated backwards and smacked right into the diving board. I can still hear that cracking sound in my mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sitting 8 feet off the ground in the lifeguard chair at the diving well watching this all go down and I am praying that I don't have to do anything, even though I knew shit was about to go down. I didn't see any blood, which was a good sign, but as I watched his body sink down I counted \"One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand.\" No movement. Fuck. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI blew three short tweets on the whistle, the cadence to signal to the other guards that I would need the neck board, and jumped in with my buoy making as little of an impact as possible in the water. My life guard training took over as I dove down 8 to 9 feet to grab this dude. He was out. Just making no movement whatsoever. Like I said, he was a big dude, but he wasn't as heavy in the water as I grabbed him and kicked us both up to the surface. I hoisted him onto the buoy and swam over to the edge, where by now the other guards had stuck the board down into the water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI lined up his limp body with the board as we all worked together to strap him into the board. The other guards pivoted the boards out of the water while I climbed out. I took a half second look around to a half dozen shocked faces and it became clear to me that this was my show. Great. Still obeying my adrenaline fueled rote memory of my training, I shouted for someone to call an ambulance as I made a decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee, I thought he probably had a next injury. The board he was strapped into is designed to not move his head, so he doesn't further injure his neck or back. But he wasn't visibly breathing so I had to save his life at whatever cost it took. Or at least that's what my 16 year old brain decided. So I started chest compressions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat they don't tell you about chest compressions is that you are breaking shit. You can feel bones and cartilage cracking under your palms. It feels horrible. I still haven't been able to shake that feeling. 1 round of 30 and then I did two breaths into his mouth--his head was already titled back a bit from being in the board so I didn't have to move his neck. After two breaths, I went back to chest compressions, and after 5 or 6 a little water leaked out of his mouth, he coughed a few times, and the other guards picked up the board and whisked him away so fast I didn't even know what happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI rolled over onto the concrete, a tinnitus like ringing in my head, my heart racing, just sitting there taking it in. I went into some trance as my teenage body struggled to deal with what just happened. Start to finish it probably only took about 6 minutes, but it felt like a lifetime of stress and nausea had built up in my body. I was walked over to the guard shack, dried off, and walked up to the country club's nicer member buildings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe manager, who was a friend's dad and had gotten me the job, sat down with me as we talked about what happened. I gave him the basic details, signed some documents, and was sent home for the day. Like I said, I was in some kind of trance and was just operating on autopilot. I'm not sure how much sense I was making at the time, and it took me several hours to process what just happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI came back for my shift a few days later, and I was told by another lifeguard that the guy was okay. I was thanked profusely by the member who brought him as a guest, but I never saw that guy again. This was still the craziest thing that has ever happened. I'm glad my instincts took over and I remembered my training. I might not have done everything exactly right, but I tried my best and at the end of the day he lived through it. I hope that guy's doing okay.",
            "This is one long ass story but the coincidence is astounding.\n\nI am from a tiny province in the Philippines who decided to work in Manila right after college way back 2007. I got into a call center and met a lot of friends. Stayed in the company for about 2 years, graveyard shift wasn\u2019t for me. Fast forward to 2013, my widowed mom in the province met through a mutual friend a French guy and they both got interested with each other. They eventually got engaged in 2014 and married soon after (90DF France?) so they could move back to France.\n\nAs they were planning their trip, I posted on social media about possible Filipino connections in France to help my mom transition well. A former colleague of mine in that call center in Manila many years back sent me a message. Told me that she has this Filipina friend (let\u2019s call her Rowena) who has been living in France for 20+ years now and that she may be able to help my mom. So, I told my mom to add Rowena on Facebook and connect with her. They did and they got into talking. One day my mom was Skyping with her, they were talking about their husbands when my mom pulled out and showed to her a vintage photo of her husband when he was in university. An old photo of him sitting on a couch with his then best friend whom he has not seen since graduating. Career opportunities abroad and no cellphones during that time led to them growing apart.\n\nAs soon as Rowena saw the photo, she gasped. \u201cThat\u2019s my husband beside your husband!\u201d, she said. She then hurriedly went to her office and took out the exact same photo which her husband has kept through the years as well. After a few shocks and tears, two long lost best friends were able to catch up after nearly 40 years.\n\nTL;DR\nBy amazing coincidence, two best friends found each other through their wives.",
            "For context: i'm a 19 year old Scottish guy who was interrailing around Europe for a month. We were in Budapest for a few days hitting up the clubs and sparties, really enjoying ourselves. Eventually it comes time to leave and we decide to get an early morning train to Split (around 5 am). Anyways, we have 2 taxis booked to the train station and we stumble out still kind of half asleep and start loading our stuff in to the taxis. As we're loading we see 3 young guys sprinting full speed ahead up the road shouting \"fucking run\". We laughed, thought they were just having drunk fun. No, no they were not. As we get in the taxis this guy covered head to toe in tattoos and others blood comes to my door and asks to shake my hand. Not wanting to offend this crazy lookin fucker i shake his bloodied hand and he wishes me well. Phew, got off lightly. Guy tries to do the same with our big fuck off Bulgarian taxi driver. He refuses. Bulgarian taxi driver gets in taxi and starts to back out. Crazy fuck is not happy with this and starts to go to town on this guys taxi with elbows, fists, knees etc. We start to drive away thinking theres no chance hes gonna be bothered to follow a taxi going 20mph? Right? Nah this fuck is fuckin superman, sprints faster than humanely possible after our taxi with this mad look in his eye. Taxi driver goes to turn a corner, thinking wed got away from him, but as we turn theres a bin lorry blocking the entire road. Crazy fuck rounds this corner like an atom out the fuckin hadron collider. At this point im shouting half asleep Scottish at our taxi driver \"LOCK EH FUKIN DOORS\" which he thankfully does. Crazy fuck starts battering the windows in with fists, blood smeared everywhere, knuckles burst. Rips off the wing mirrors, starts smashing the windows in with them. At this point our friends in the taxi behind us are buckled in laughter as we sit in pure terror as the fuckin grim reaper looms ready to take our souls. Both taxi drivers get out to get him to fuck off, spits in both their faces and throws the wingmirror at them then books it out of there. Maddest thing about it is as he was leaving he very nicely apologises to one of the locals watching this in awe. \nTLDR: dont refuse handshakes from men covered in blood, its rude. ",
            "This is a long story from the early 1980's that has Kentucky justice in it.  My family lived just outside of Cincinnati on the Kentucky side of the Ohio river.  My father's older brother lived here as well and was a father to four daughters.  One of his daughter's at the age of 18 or so was dating a guy who was a little older than her, who convinced her to move down south with him.  My uncle approved and his daughter headed south with her boyfriend into a Kentucky Holler that his extended family lived in.  Time passed and my uncle hadn't heard from his daughter in a while, and he started to grow concerned.  My cousin called my uncle in distress from a pay phone at a grocery store, saying she was being mistreated by her boyfriend's family and being held hostage and worked like a slave.  Before my uncle could learn more, the phone was cut off.  At this point in the story, it's important to know my uncle was an avid hunter and gun collector.  He explained to his wife and other daughters the situation, he packed up his Oldsmobile Delta 88 with his favorite guns and headed down to the holler his daughter's boyfriend was from.  He was going down in hillbilly country, where there were no street names, just dirt roads and family farms.  By the time he finally found their farmhouse it was night.  The boyfriend's family was on the porch shooting shotguns off into the air, fully expecting to scare my uncle away.  My uncle stopped his car 50 yards from the house and popped the trunk.  He methodically lined up his rifles on the hood of the car facing the house, tooling up like Arnold in Commando on the beach.  My uncle was an extremely large man, who was well known for having an explosive temper.  Completely unfazed, he shouted up to the hillbillies, \"IF MY DAUGHTER DOESN'T COME DOWN IN FIVE MINUTES, I'M GOING TO COME UP THERE AND KILL EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD I SEE!\"  The boyfriend and his brothers ran back inside the house and not even one minute later my cousin came running out of the house with her single suitcase.  \n\nSame uncle another time, was driving on a bridge that spanned some small river.  The bridge was old and only had enough room for one car to traverse at a time.  He came to a standoff with three hillbillies in a pickup truck who were honking and yelling at him to back up.  My uncle ever stubborn refused and instead got out of his car figuring he'd show them how big he was and they'd change their tune.  One of the hill billies shouted to my uncle, \"You don't scare us, there are three of us!\"  And my uncle like a psychopath shouted back, \"Do all three of you know how to swim?\"  To which they relented and backed up their truck to let my uncle pass.",

Remember, everyone is posting their Greatest Hits. Remember, everybody poops \u2014 even the girl posting glam pics from Greece, she probably pooped right before or after the pic.

And, as long as it will not launch you into a huge debt, it IS ok to Major in something you might not end up getting a career in. (To an extent). College is more than career training. It\u2019s a much bigger learning experience about... everything! People, the world, yourself.

Appreciate the experience for what it gave you, and move on. \n5.\tLastly, and where I go all old lady, Please put your phone away in the car. Even at stoplights. Just wait until you arrive. You may be super used to it, but it only takes one second of inattention to become potentially fatal. Someone just died in my neighborhood for this very reason. Sending a snap. It can wait.\n6.\t(edit to add #6) Teach yourself personal finance basics. Your school and maybe parents probably neglected this, if times haven\u2019t changed all that much. But... The internet is wonderful! You can teach yourself. Take an edX or Kahn or iTunesU course. Learn the basics and start saving. Really truly understand student loans before taking them. And save. Saving sounds like something you have plenty of time for later... when you make more money... but tomorrow never comes. Learn and save now."

He was smiling and saying something in an eastern European accent.  I left the area and went to the other side of the terminal.. but I was so tired I feel asleep again and again woke up to this same creep groping me.  This was in the 1980's before ubiquitous cameras and there were no cops around... not that I would have been able to tell- I was embarrassed and traumatized.  I can still see his creepy smile and I was so angry and afraid."

I love you very much!\" A few weeks later, my mom, sisters and I went to visit her in the home, as my mom is her primary caretaker. I pulled the dollar from my pocket and read the note aloud.

I'm just a student and Wall Street guys must know what they're doing...'\n\nAnd then 2008 happened...",
            "Late to the party here, but what the hell, 'cause this story is BONKERS.\n\nBack in the early '90s I was in my early twenties and, as people in their early twenties often do, I spent a lot of late nights at my local Denny's hanging out with friends and drinking cheap coffee.\n\nThe late-night wait staff was pretty small, so my friends and I wound up getting to know them pretty well -- socializing with them as well. Some of them would hook us up with free fries or sodas, that kind of thing, and every now and again if things were slow, they'd sit at our booth with us. One of the people who would hang out with us was Charles.\n\nCharles was an older guy in his 50s who was very nice to my friends and me, but he was a little... creepy. He would never get overt about it, but he definitely embraced the whole 'creepy uncle' persona, maybe even being a little tongue-in-cheek about it. He'd tell the girls in my group how pretty they were, and how he wished he was still young, that sort of thing. Reading between the lines, he was telling them he wished he could have sex with them. BUT THIS IS NOT GOING WHERE YOU THINK IT IS. I'm just setting the stage, y'all. \n\nThe guy was a little weird, but he *was* a nice guy to us. All the same, I remember telling people \"Charles has a secret. He's in his fifties, slinging coffee at an all-night restaurant, but he comes off as educated and sort of worldly. He talks about traveling and living well --  I don't know what it is, but Charles is damaged. I bet he killed somebody or something.\" I was convinced that the \"nice guy\" bit was a cover for something dark.\n\nUH, YEAH.\n\nSo as my group got older, people came and went, some of us fell out with others, some of us got real jobs and couldn't stay up until 4:00am at a Denny's, and we eventually stopped hanging out there. Never really gave Charles much thought after that, for YEARS.\n\nThen I saw Charles on the news.\n\nTurns out Charles was Charles Rothenberg, a man who, in 1983, was going through a bad divorce. In what I understand was originally intended to be a murder-suicide, he drugged his six-year-old son David, doused the boy in kerosene, and lit him on fire. \n\nDavid survived, but was horribly scarred for the rest of his life. Charles continued to get into criminal trouble, and was ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison as a result of California's \"Three Strikes\" law. He's still in prison today, but in the late '90s he changed his name to \"Charley Charles,\" because sure, why not.\n\nIn 1988 there was a TV movie based on the incident called \"David,\" which starred Bernadette Peters as his mother.\n\nMeanwhile his son David became one of Michael Jackson's child-friends and eventually an artist. \n\nWhen he was 19, he visited Charles in prison, apparently reading a prepared statement to him: \n\n\"Charles, you are not my father. You are an impostor. Parents don't hinder their children from experiencing a normal childhood. I wish that you could experience the trauma and pain that I have gone through.\"\n\nAfterward, David told the press \"He wanted me to know that he loved me. The last thing I said was, 'No you don't.' And I walked out.\"\n\nIn a somewhat bizarre turn, David later legally changed his own name to \"Dave Dave,\" mirroring the \"Charley Charles\" name his father adopted. I have no idea if this is coincidental somehow, but the irony is not lost on me, that's for sure.\n\nDave Dave even appeared on the Larry King show to talk about Michael Jackson when he died. If I recall correctly, he defended Jackson against the reports of child molestation and denied he was a victim of Jackson's. \n\nUnfortunately Dave Dave himself passed away last year, at the age of 42 -- his ongoing medical issues, which were the result of his burn injuries, eventually killed him. And in my opinion, that means Charles was ultimately successful in murdering his son.\n\nSo, yeah. I called it -- Charles was harboring something dark when he was getting free fries for my friends and telling the girls how pretty they were. I just had no idea HOW dark.",

            "Not exactly being offered sexual favours for a grade, but when I was a TA in a certain small humanities department, there was this anonymous 'campus confessions' site that was a big trend with the undergrad students at our university. Lots of confessions about wanting to fuck certain professors/TAs. One day, a confession appeared on the page from a student who had a crush on a male TA from our department, which went into rather lurid detail about everything she (or he, couldn't tell) wanted to do to him, and it mentioned the TA's 'gorgeous blue eyes'. I suppose the student didn't think that was too identifying, but they severely underestimated how small our department was. We had 10 graduate students total, 4 of whom were TAing that semester. I was one of them, but I'm a girl, and two of the guys had brown eyes. The only male TA with blue eyes was... mighty uncomfortable and had to go through the rest of the semester knowing that one of the students in his section was sitting in class everyday having elaborate sexual fantasies about him.

We stayed in the classroom with both doors and all windows wide open. I sat down next to her to go over some material and about ten seconds into it she put her hand pretty high on my inner thigh. I pulled away and told her that it was inappropriate, and I wrapped up our meeting with some instructions on what she should work on. I left and had no interest in making a big deal out of it. A couple weeks later I had a colleague approach me and say that she had heard that I had made a pass at this very same student, and that I had put my hand on HER thigh and that she rejected me. I got out in front of it and didn't experience any repercussions, but that was a bit scary. I never helped another student anywhere but a public place on campus, like a cafe or in a park.

The student from the club starts emailing, mostly just asking questions about her project and such. Nothing untoward. Eventually, it starts getting a little flirty.  She starts coming over and going out with us occasionally.\n\nWe ended up hooking up when she had two weeks left in my class and like six weeks before graduation.

A few others might have been hinting, but I steered the conversation away and if they were, they clearly took the hint.  I had a man, maybe early to mid 20s try to offer sex for a grade.  At the time, I was maybe 27.  He was failing because he plagiarized his entire paper worth about 45% or the semester grade.  I had called him to my office to say I found it was plagiarized and he was getting a zero.  He knowingly submitted his assignment through safe-assign.  I spend part of the first class discussing plagiarism and consequences.  Still he plagiarized.  I have an option to file to have them expelled, but I\u2019ve never done that.

I shut him down quickly and we went to the department chair and explained the situation.  He had to sign a letter saying he understands his actions were inappropriate.  It was filed with the college.  No other actions were taken.  He didn\u2019t try again.  He kept attending and did an extra credit project that I offer to the whole class at the end of the semester.  He passed with the lowest possible score.  \n\nAs a grad student, I had a professor proposition me.  In exchange he offered to put me on several of his upcoming publications.  I declined.

At its worst, I began misremembering important life events, only to find out years later that what I felt I so vividly remembered to be true, was actually not. But I guess that's psychosis for you.

Otherwise, just get some sleep.\n\nEdit: so like I have a million responses in my inbox, and it's fucking making me anxious. I won't be responding to any of them directly.\n\n1. If you're concerned, see a doctor. I went to my GP first and he referred me to specialists.\n\n2. The reason it's bad if they acknowledge you is because if you're just sleep deprived or mentally wonky, the shadow people tend to disappear when you focus on them, and don't appear to be up to any real funny business.\n\n3. Shadow people. What are they? Humanoids of questionable origin and intent; also made of shadows.\n\n4. For the one guy who was offended. Why? I'm describing symptoms. Ily though.\n\n5.

Prevents thinking, conversation and encourages conforming\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Several speeches from my upline about how we shouldn't spend our time with people who don't want to be apart of the company, including family and life long friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Planning on moving into the same community together that was referred to as the 'Primerica Estates'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Parents had a halloween party planned the same night as my Primerica office's halloween party.

They wanted us to go on a bus or van together.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The idea that someone would be happier doing something other than Primerica?  Comical.  Surgeons, lawyers, military officers, scientists, all would be better off joining Primerica and giving up their jobs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Doing something that wasn't Primerica related?  You better be ready to explain yourself.  One guy got chewed out in front of the office for going to his grandmother's 80th birthday party.  I went out of state with my then wife to celebrate our anniversary required me explaining to those running the office about my actual dedication to the company, even though I was only gone for one fucking weekend.  I even had to explain myself when I stayed home one Sunday to replace the brakes on my car.  I was asked \"How is that going to improve your business?\"  My answer was \"I have to drive to people's homes to sell policies.  I shouldn't have to explain how car maintenance is a business related thing.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Hobbies had to almost be company approved.  If you're reading a book, it better be one to improve your business.  Have a hobby that doesn't have any relation to Primerica?  Drop it and focus more on Primerica.  Sell your television if it's a distraction from your business.  When it came to getting to the company event in Georgia, we were told that getting there is our highest priority.  Sell anything you can if you can't afford to go (tickets alone were over $100), including televisions, video game consoles, computers, so on and so forth...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Kids weren't safe either.  Those members who were dedicated 100% to the company who had kids, drug their kids to the office on nights and weekends.  I saw kids the day after Christmas, with some of their new toys, playing at the table in our breakroom, fighting off boredom.  One pair of parents had a kid who got a laser tag birthday party invite that was the same day as one of the big dull events where higher ups from out of state came in to speak to us in long dull speeches.  The parents told their kid, nearly in tears as we were in line to enter the event room, that going to this event was more important than playing laser tag.

            "FAs: you guys are fucking awesome. when I was 16 I moved from the US to Germany as an exchange student. I was alone, had never flown by myself, and didn\u2019t speak German. From Frankfurt to Bremen I got RIDICULOUSLY sick, I think it was a mix of altitude sickness and anxiety. \n\nI was so embarrassed and upset and I hadn\u2019t slept in 24 hours. The flight attendants let me move to a seat closer to the bathroom, and kept checking in on me every ten minutes with cold paper towels, water, and sprite. They also kept me up to date with how much longer until we landed, etc. \n\nAnyway. I was very scared and very lonely and just wanted my mom. I\u2019m so thankful for the kindness everyone showed me. ",
            "When people ask for the reason for a delay, we usually give a bullshit response because the REAL answer would spook passengers. \"We have a minor technical problem and engineers are on their way\" And in reality: The cabin pressure isn't working.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso here is another thing: It means A LOT to us if a passenger actually says hello back to us and smiles. We'll remember your face. Believe me, because we got 150+ people who usually ignore us. One guy said \"Hey good morning!\" to me, and all flight I gave him alcohol on priority right away, while I made others wait 5-10 minutes because I was busy. Also, say 'thank you'. It really makes my day. I took count of how many \"thanks\" I got. 200 passengers at 18 said \"Thanks\". Sometimes I load my pockets with cookies, nuts, crackers, mini whiskey bottles, and whenever I pass by, I offer them. ",
            "Top things I get asked:\n1: What\u2019s your route? \nIt\u2019s rare that a flight attendant does the same thing over and over again. In some cases, very senior flight attendants will bc they can hold the best trips, like NYC-LAX turns giving them 12 hours pay for one day. Most of us fly a variety of things, and we all like different stuff. I prefer turns that get me home every night by 3pm. Some people like 3 days that have fun layovers. So many options\n2: How long do you get to stay on the layover?\nAnywhere from 9 hours to 50. There\u2019s are times where we land at a place at 10pm and have to be up for he first flight in the morning. On the flip side sometimes we get to be in a place for an entire day or even longer for some overseas. And everything in between. (My sweet spot is 13 hours bc it\u2019s long enough to get decent rest but not too long that I\u2019m away from home unnecessarily)\n3: Do I fly for free?\nDomestically yes, internationally you pay taxes in the flight home. This is all standby and you never know if there will be a seat or not. I\u2019ve been stuck places many times (looking at you Athens)",
            "The lack of stability in my schedule is a huge thing that people don\u2019t really know about, I find out where I\u2019m going for the month on the 21st of the month before. Unless I have my booked leave there I have no idea what my days off will be.\n\nIn January I turned up to work for a Nairobi trip and got reassigned to a Chicago 20 minutes before I was due for my briefing. Arrived in ORD dressed for the African summer.\n\nAs for things you don\u2019t know, almost always we pick our BFF or Boyfriend for the Flight who is simply the most attractive guy on the flight just for a bit of fun. We also discuss amongst us how nice out \u2018side\u2019 is. On wide-body aircraft there\u2019s 2 aisles and we work each side. Once we\u2019ve done the initial drinks round we often have a casual chat over what they\u2019re like; \u201cMy side is pretty nice, they\u2019re drinking a lot of alcohol though. 34D is a dick but there\u2019s a family of four at the front who are lovely.\u201d\n\nIf you drink too much and we cut you off when you ask for your 4th double vodka tonic in an hour, don\u2019t try and pull the wool over our eyes and ask someone else. We know about you, the onboard manager will know about you and the Captain will know about you. As soon as I cut someone off I let the crew working with me know that I\u2019ve stopped giving 28B alcohol. When the manager calls us (every half an hour at my airline) we let them know that 28B has been cut off, and in turn they\u2019ll let the Captain know. It\u2019s nothing major but I don\u2019t think a lot of people realise how much we keep the flight deck in the loop on everything that\u2019s going on.\n\nPeople in business and first class don\u2019t realise they\u2019re cracking off their warm smelling bed farts all the time when they\u2019re trying to sleep and it\u2019s disgusting.\n\nAnd yes we know when you\u2019re getting handsy with eachother.",
            "This is more of a question, really. I'm Deaf and I usually tell that when I'm getting my ticket -- mostly for pre-boarding but also so that in an emergency, they know that I can't hear the overhead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the reaction I get from FAs is SO bizarre sometimes. One time I was given a braille safety instruction guide (Delta). One time a FA sat next to me and pointed at all the pictures on the safety instruction guide (American or United, I believe). But most airlines, I get off the plane and... there is a wheelchair waiting for me???? WHY?",
            "To add to this, most airlines I've worked with have a monthly minimum, meaning I get paid for 75 hours a month regardless of if I'm actually flying that amount.",
            "A few years back, I was flying home from college on vacation freshman year. I had fallen asleep before the flight attendant came around handing out packs of peanuts, and woke to find a few packs in my hand. \n\nNo one was sitting around me. To the flight attendant who put peanuts in my hand while I was asleep, I salute you. o7",
            "Thanks OP for your interest!\n\n1) Hairspray can set off the lavatory smoke alarms. Also, yes, your vape. \n\n2) Whenever I take a flight as a passenger out of uniform, I always greet the flight attendants in the front and usually the pilots, and let them know I\u2019m a flight attendant. It\u2019s not industry standard, but the idea is to let them know where my seat is incase there\u2019s an emergency and I\u2019m an extra set of helpful hands.\n\n3) Junior flight attendants are exhausted.  Zombies walking around, facing minor hypoxia, sleep deprivation, negative bank accounts, and general anxiety. That was me during our airlines required \u2018reserve\u2019 period. It\u2019s comparable to new RN\u2019s and doctors who are on call.  You can be on call for 24 hours, which means at any point you have two hours to be at the airport, in uniform, ready to fly any flight they assign you. Once you finish that assignment, which can be anywhere from 2 hours to 4 days, you have 9 hours of \u2018rest\u2019 before you go back on call. \n\n3) Every flight attendant has a \u2018base\u2019, but not every airport is a base. Many flight attendants are therefore \u2018commuters\u2019. For example, you can live in Ohio but you\u2019re a new hire who was assigned SFO as your base. You can move to the most expensive city in the country, or commute before your assignments from the Midwest to SFO every time. Many flight attendants (and pilots!) mitigate this logistic by staying in \u2018Crashpads\u2019 a few nights a month, apartments under one name on the lease but with bunk beds and shared spaces and divided rent. \n\n5) Salary and union representation are interesting topics as well, some great comments already in this thread about that.\n\n6) Most of us love our jobs!",
            "\"where are we flying over right now?\"\n\nWe never know.\n\nAlso, to open a bi-fold lavatory door, simply push in the middle. Where it says PUSH. One of the negative aspects of the job is when people yank off the ashtray thinking it's a door handle and then ask WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE THOSE STILL. It's an FAA requirement, ashtrays need to be on every plane in case someone decides to fuck the rules and light up.",
            "Unless you're extremely lucky and your aircraft just rolled out of the hangar after major maintenance, there will absolutely be something broken in it. An aircraft can have a whole host of parts be broken and still be allowed to fly, the broken parts just get labeled, recorded, and put on the to-do list for the next time it goes to maintenance. "

Weeks after the deaths of several children, from what was originally misdiagnosed as tonsilitis, Dr. Welch confirms the presence of diptheria in his hospital.

Everything flooded. Countless people lost everything. Grand Forks/East Grand Forks got hit the hardest and when you thought it couldn\u2019t get worse, buildings downtown caught fire (yup, water up to the second floor, top floors on fire.) \n\nI have never seen people band together like during the flood. I was just a kid, but between sandbagging, cleanup, and getting lives back together, it was heartwarming. People were taking in families and schools all over the place were making room for kids. Volunteers were everywhere for every step of the way. People put in the labor, donated food and clothing, gave money. Together the Valley was rebuilt. It was insane watching everyone work together. \n\nEdit: Thanks for the silver! I love reading your memories about the flood. We went through it again in 2002 in Roseau, MN. Much smaller town but just as bad for flooding. It was awful. Roseau is my mom\u2019s hometown and she watched her childhood drown. There again, the community banded together to rebuild. And again in 2009 in Fargo. We were sandbagging in a blizzard. We worked so hard on this one house. The water was coming up so fast and we sandbagged our little hearts out. The water started coming under the pile and the firemen pulled us out of there. My heart broke for the family, but we just bussed to the next house and started over. ",

The letter was incredibly emotional\u2014it was clear he was beloved by those who worked with him.

            "Not my house, but the school my friend worked at.  \n\n\nA pipe had leaked and ruined a wall in the building, one of the oldest schools in the city.  It was a beautiful property.  Anyways the pipe leaked so they pulled down the ruined wall and behind the wall found a door. \n\n\nA fully furnished apartment was there.  Had a coal burning stove to heat it. Early 1900s appliances and decor. It was for the caretaker of the school.  \n\n\n",
            "My house has a two person jacuzzi tub with mirrors on three walls around it. When I was looking at the house there was a four post canopy bed with a mirror inside the canopy. Needless to say, the previous owner had his thing. \n\nWhen I was moving in I found in the basement a bar with cuffs on either end hanging from the ceiling and two eye bolts in a board on the floor that would have made this a perfect place to tie someone up spread eagle. I strongly suspect that is what it was used for. \n\nI have a room that used to be a bar (previous owner took the bar itself with him despite it being a built in). It has a dropped ceiling and the lights are above with clear panels to let the light thru. I was moving ceiling tiles to change a bulb and got hit in the face by what I\u2019m guessing was a home made sex swing that was bolted to the rafters above. \n\nI\u2019ve been in this house 15 years and I still occasionally find a secret panel in a wall. It seems anywhere there was an extra bit of space he put a removable panel to make a hidden storage space. \n\nAnd despite all that, the single most surprising thing I found in this house is the light switch in the bathroom that has power going to it but doesn\u2019t seem to actually switch anything in the house! What do you go to you mysterious switch? When will you stop taunting me and give up your secrets!!!",

Behind it and under the stair were some way old toys. Most likely from the 50s. In the same house about a year later. We paid a company to come put new insulation in the attic. When he was done he told me we had a portion of our attic sealed off. So we busted through. Found a super old sewing table and about 15 boxes of PINECONES",
            "My dad moved into an apartment and the whole place had its nice original wood flooring from the 1940s except for the living room, which had carpet. Kind of a bummer because the wood looks nicer but oh well.\n   One problem, though. When it's warm out the living room smells. Can you guess where this is going?\n\nMy dad decided to investigate and eventually peeled the carpet up to find a large black stain on the subfloor. \nA black stain so large a person could lie inside of it. \n\nThe last Tennant died and melted in the living room and all they did was pull the hardwood up.

His mom left a few boxes behind in the garage and one of them was full of all his old arrest info, letters from his parole officer, and most depressingly...a letter from the judge recommending he be remanded to a psychiatric facility instead of prison.  Apparently he lived his adult years in a home for schizophrenics and died a few years ago.  The whole thing was just very sad.",

As well as several (about 10) old 50's cars just scattered around the property and hidden in the tree line. \n\nThe owner had a small shed on the property she asked us to never open. No worries. It sat between the garage and an old mobile home trailer that was never used.\n\nWe moved away, and shortly after the owner died. New property owners went into the shed. Found tons of old WWII and older equipment. Guns. Bayonets. A Nazi flag. All sorts of shit. This shed even had an old school dirt wall basement that had old radios and tons of other crazy stuff. \n\nUnfortunately, after the new owners started messing with the shed, the basement, being dirt and all eventually gave way and a lot of stuff was damaged. They were able to salvage a lot and sold it all so it worked out. \n\nMost I found was a previous tenant's porn stash, as a teenager in the old trailer.  Best find ever.\n\nEdit: words."

            "Countless times at the go-kart place (summer job) where I work I\u2019ve had to put up with special needs kids whose caretakers or parents dropped them off and drove off because they wanted a break from them. these kids (and adults) have a mental age of anywhere from 3-15 and many times they are unable to follow the directions that we provide or even listen to us. They are not only a danger to themselves but to the other riders and to us the staff. An easy solution to this would be for their parents to ride with them in a double and to drive for them allowing them to have fun without having to put anyone in danger. However that \u201ccosts more money\u201d and \u201cthey don\u2019t want to\u201d one parent even said \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just ride with him?\u201d and when I asked if she would be comfortable with other people she said he wasn\u2019t. I wanted to call her a shitty parent but I didn\u2019t want to lose my job. We can\u2019t deny them as they have the physical age to ride. But are hopefully putting rules in place to require parents of children with special needs to ride with their parents.\n\nEdit: I hold nothing against these kids, but the fact is that their parents are responsible for them. If they want a break from them they could hire a caretaker. Even then though I understand that bad parents do exist, however it is the caretakers who refuse to take care of the kids who are unacceptable. YOU ARE GETTING PAID! Do your job!\n\nEdit 2: typo",
            "TL; DR: Toyota Service Advisor working his bloody feet off alone.  quits after returning everything to the state is was when I got there while Boss had to deal with the army of customers he allowed to set unlimited appointments. \n\n-------\n\nI worked at a Toyota Service Department for a few months...it was terrible in general but one day was the worst.\n\nDuring the week I had a nail go straight through my foot so I'm bandaged up and have to walk around to get everything. Probably 100 yards to the car wash, 40 yards to the shop etc.\n\nMy team for Saturday (4 people) had 1 person quit on Wednesday and 1 person had a funeral to leave early for. The other guy was new so he was slow to get stuff done. My boss says he'll come in and help.\n\nWednesday we lock it at 60 appointments since we have short staff up front and back. We do take walk ins too. Thursday it's at 80, and we tell our boss to lock it. Again on Friday before closing we see 110 appointments. He never locked it. Come Saturday morning we had 130 appointments from 7am-4pm. \n\nI'm having to walk around a lot and ended up bleeding through 3 pairs of socks and bandages. I had to chase down about 80% of our customers cars because our Porter's were goofing off.\n\nI had 53 opened tickets at 12pm, we had a 4 hour wait for walk ins, and 2 with appointments. Haven't had lunch or a snack since they banned food/drinks at our desks. My friend is about to leave for the funeral so I cover his work. and my boss leaves for lunch throwing his 20ish tickets on my desk.\n\nSo I'm now 110 tickets deep, helping the new guy with stuff, moving cars, and trying not to pass out. Oh did I mention 95F outside, no AC in our covered area (not inside) and 90% humidity? We didn't even get a breeze. Can't have snacks/drinks at our desks either. \n\nIt gets to 3pm and I'm rescheduling people, trying to get everyone out when their cars are done but have to limp them down to pull them in front to leave after they pay. My boss still isn't back and the new guy quits.\n\nI end up getting in one car and blood from my sock drips onto our paper mats in the car. I cleaned everything out, vacuumed the car, washed it, and pulled it up. Customer went APE SHIT that she saw blood on the disposable paper mat, about the wait, not getting a discount for her non-appointment service, and demanded to speak to my manager. That was it.\n\nCalled him up and sent to voicemail. I explained it to his mailbox then called the GM to explain that I have been alone for about 3 hours dealing with an un-capped amount of customers, 5 technicians walked out, I'm still not recovered from my workplace injury, and that I'm finishing my paperwork to take my lunch break at 4:00PM.\n\nBoss shows up when I'm about to leave to eat my lunch I brought knowing their \"provided lunch\" would be gone before I could set foot in the break room. He told me that in our state I'm not legally allowed a lunch break during a shift & I have to stay to finish out the customers on my tickets. I mentioned being here since 6am pre-printing everything saying I just need to relax and he said \"You didn't even clock in this morning so unless you do what I say, you aren't getting paid\". \n- Service advisors are paid commission here, and % of parts profit for stuff sold. I don't even get $0.10 an hour. -\n\nSo I walked to my station, removed all of everyone's login copies of my permissions, deleted all of my notes, deleted all of my warranty macros, all the spreadsheets, and reset every custom line I added to our programs before I removed my admin permissions. Walked out & got a call when I got to my car asking \"Why isn't your login able to collect credit cards?\" so he had to either write down credit card info, take cash/checks, or let them go. \n\n\nMy GM asked me to come back at a pay raise and less hours but I knew it was bs. My boss ended up getting let go the following month since he couldn't get things back up to speed. My good friend moved to Mercedes parts so he's happy.\n\nI ended up going to BMW for a bit after that and handled a few other franchises later\n\nEdit: Wow this blew up, if I get on a YouTube video please unsub. I'll reply to all comments but it will take some time. Thanks guys!\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the Silver & Gold kind strangers.

As he peered at me over his glasses he said, \"I like it really wet, ladyandluna,\" and licked his lips. I put in a whole bunch, but kept repeating how wet he liked it, asking for more oil. I put in at least half a bottle of oil.\n\nThen he goes on to say how he loves parmesan cheese, like A LOT of it. I shook in a bunch of cheese, but he still wasn't satisfied. I was pissed off and creeped out at this point so I took the lid off the cheese and dumped the entire shaker full into the bowl. He was fucking thrilled. \"Ladyandluna, you're the best. You make the best salad, no one anywhere else gets it like you do. You're perfect.\"\n\nHe came back several times, asking for me, and if I was there he refused to be served by anyone else.

Because of the nature of the program, I often worked in bad areas and a lot of section 8 projects. \n\nWe have a generator on the back of our truck that we use daily (the power supply in most of these run down homes wasn\u2019t enough to support our tools). As you can imagine, the generator is pretty loud. A lot of the time, you\u2019d hear it sputter and kick on and off. This usually meant some debris/dirt got into the fuel filter. No problem. Clean it out and start it back up again. One morning, we fire up the generator and get to work. While I\u2019m 12 ft up on a ladder, installing a bathroom fan vent, I hear the generator start to slowly quiet down. I roll my eyes because I know I\u2019ll have to get down, go out front to the truck and clean the filter.

And gets fainter and fainter. I knew something was up.\n\nI get down from the ladder and go out front. About 5 houses away on the sidewalk are two gentlemen, trying their best to run away with our generator while it was still on. The thing weighs about 300lbs and it awkward as fuck to carry (even with two people). The strain and back crippling run they were doing was impressive. I really couldn\u2019t even be mad.

            "How normal it seemed until I was out from under that. You grow up knowing how to stay off the radar and not bother the wrong people. You see wild, crazy, scary things on the regular, and learn to keep your mouth shut and pretend you didn\u2019t. You are just a kid, like any other kid, but you have to be preternaturally aware of the relationships and hierarchies and happenings around you all the time to make sure you don\u2019t end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. For example, there was a guy who let his big mean dogs (I don\u2019t remember the breed) run loose in the neighborhood, but the dogs respected boundaries in terms of how close you could get to their house before you got your throat torn out. Stay far enough aware and they just sat watching you, with the occasional menacing growl. I spent the year we lived there thinking it was perfectly normal that I couldn\u2019t walk home from school on that one side of the street on penalty of death. It\u2019s just what happens. It\u2019s just your normal. ",
            "Couple years ago I was leaving my house for uni when I heard a huge bashing sound coming from my neighbours house, who I didn\u2019t know well but had always seen around and chatted to occasionally. I lived with my bro and it was a rough neighbourhood with lots of break-ins and fights so I always tried to keep my head down and be polite. Anyway, I had a look and saw a guy (who later turned out to be a plain clothed policeman) with a battering ram breaking into the house. Police then swarmed the house and removed about 4 women (who looked like they had been abused), a whole bunch of dudes, and a shit-tonne of drugs and weapons. Turns out they were running a brothel and had been monitored by police for months. I knew something dodgy was going on because guys would come and go in the middle of the night and could always smell weed, but I had no idea it was that serious. Turns out they were keeping the women hooked on drugs and threatened them if they ever leaves the house. Scary stuff.\n\nWas always polite to them and kept my head down whenever possible. This was in the UK but I guess the same thing would work anywhere else.\n\nEdit: This took place in Leeds. Love the debates in the comments, also love seeing everyone assume it was the midlands.

            "Not me but my mom, who was and still is a flight attendant. She was working a flight from DFW-BOS that morning, they were approaching the northeast when they were diverted to Akron, OH. I\u2019m not sure what she was specifically told but I know they knew something was up. Their flight communications are even included in transcripts from that day. \n\nBy that time both towers had been hit and they were headed west over Pennsylvania to land. My mom said they were all on edge not really comprehending the severity of the situation and wondering whether they might be hijacked themselves. They were communicating with Cleveland on the ground when the hijacking of United 93 began over western PA, so there was communication between both flights and ground trying to confirm that the screaming etc they heard on the frequency was really a hijacking? Apprently United 93 was right behind them and my mom says the crew was back and forth up in the cockpit and in the galley looking out the windows trying to see the plane, while trying not to scare passengers. ",
            "My father was actually on the runway in Newark about to take off on a business trip when the first plane hit. They waited on the the runway for awhile and then the pilot came on and said that there was a tragedy in new york and that they were returning to the terminal and that the flight was cancelled. Back inside the airport, they were greeted with SWAT forcing everyone in the airport to the baggage claim. At this point everyone knew what happened. My father has extremely poor hearing and accidentally went outside instead of down to the lower level where the baggage claim is. He said there was no one outside, and that it was very eery. He was then met by a few officers with long guns who yelled at him to get to baggage claim. Once he got his luggage in the chaos of people, he walked all the way to the private carpark place a mile or two away. The buildings had already collapsed, and the whole walk he could see the smoke rising high above the skyline. \n\nI was 4 years old and in preschool, and that morning I was out of school due to illness. I called my mother into the living room when PBS lost its sound (its antennae was on twin towers) and she flipped through the channels and discovered what was going on. Obviously she freaked the fuck out since my father was on a plane from the airport where a plane just exploded from. I vividly remember once the second plane hit, she freaked out much more, screaming like crazy, and I hid under the coffee table covering my ears. The view of the towers on the TV from under the coffee table is my only vivid memory of 9/11. I have a few other foggy memories, but another clear one is the next day at preschool, when a kid said that the towers fell down, and a teacher told him to stop talking. \n\nNorth Jersey lost a lot of commuting fathers in the attack, and my town's library has a large piece of bent metal from the wreckage as a memorial of the couple people from my small town who died.",
            "Here is an old thread on flyertalk regarding being on a plane during 9/11:\n\nhttps://www.flyertalk.com/forum/united-airlines-mileageplus/499645-listening-channel-9-september-11-2001-a.html\n\nand Excerpt:\n\n>On 9/11, I was listening to Ch. 9. I was on a flight out of ORD to AZ (757) seated in 5F. We had just taken off and where climbing to cruise. A flight out of Rockford, IL was squeezing between us and the UA in front of us. I watched as he lined up to get on the highway westbound. Then, abruptly, the Rockford flight called ATC and requested immediate clearance to return to home. ATC responded with some quick direction and asked if they were experiencing trouble. No, just directed to return home by company pronto. Hmmm, strange I thought. \n\n>Then the UA in front of us requested emergency clearance back to ORD. Loooong pause from ATC. Now, this is Chicago Center air space. There are no pauses. Certainly not 30-40 seconds of dead air. Hmm, man that is weird, I thought. Then like a starters pistol went off, the comm light up. Another plane req. clearance, then another, another.... boom, boom, boom. Nothing from ATC. I nudged the guy next to me and said put on Ch. 9. He could see by the expression on my face, I was serious. \n\n>ATC got on the air and started by saying this was going to go quick and pilots needed to listen up. \"Protocol responses are not required, just do exactly as I say quickly\". Then it began. \"UA ###, turn right heading blah, blah expect Springfield airport. SWA ###, turn left heading blah, blah expect Rockford. Delta ###....\" This went on for about 3 solid minutes before I rang the bell for the FA who was passing out breakfast. Our number had not yet been called. The FA came by and I said \"We are all going back to O'Hare, they are landing every plane in the sky. What is going on?!?\" She looked at me in disbelief and kind of leaned down to look out the window. I could see that she was about to start to tell me not to worry about it when we pitched right at about 45*s. It was so quick it nearly dumped the FA in my lap. \n\n",
            "Not entirely plane related, but my Dad worked near the towers and got out the train to see the second plane crash. It really messed him up inside. We lived in the Bronx, and everyday he went to the Park Ave. Armory where people lined up to find out about their loved ones. My Dad noticed that many didn't speak English and they were having a hard time communicating. He wrote Translation Services on a piece of paper and stapled it to his shirt and spoke Spanish, French, and Russian. He got the relief effort to spread the word to get translators. It was all over the radio and TV. The Japanese government heard and sent their best translators by special permission on a direct flight to New York (one of the few planes that could come to New York.) A Japanese bank had workspace in the towers, and the relatives of the workers also came. By the end, hundreds of people came, even those of more obscure languages from Algeria and Azerbaijan, among others. There was a fleet of Punjabi, Afrikaans, Creole, Korean, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Polish, Chinese. It's wondrous to see how something as simple as talking binds all of us. The City began implenenting translation services everwhere since. I was 12 years old at the time and didn't understand the impact. Today at 28, my Dad was a hero. \n\nEdit to show you all an article about my Dad's translation effort shown in the Spanish language newspaper, El Diario NY.  https://eldiariony.com/2012/09/08/distintos-idiomas-un-mismo-dolor/ \n\n/u/letsdraw2 ran the article through Google Translate in English: https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Feldiariony.com%2F2012%2F09%2F08%2Fdistintos-idiomas-un-mismo-dolor%2F&edit-text=&act=url \n\nThank you all for congratulating him! And thank you for the gold, kind internet stranger! I love my Dad very much. \n\n",
            "My dad was an armed high ranking federal agent. He was flying from DC to Miami (I think - definitely FL). He was woken up somewhere over Southern Virginia, and asked to come to the cockpit. The pilots told him to guard the cockpit, and that he was authorized to shoot - he spoke to someone confirming the authorization. He was given the jump seat next to the cockpit during landing, so he could see if anyone stood up. He told me later that the reason they were allowed to continue to Miami instead of putting down in the Carolinas was because he was on the plane.\n\nWhen he died in 2010, my mom showed me the piece of paper he had kept, with his notes from that radio transmission. I think my older brother has them now. \n\nSide note, when he landed, he was met by the three guys he was flying down to meet with, and they all drove back overnight, getting back just in time to help oversee the search at the pentagon. I\u2019ve never seen him as shaken as the day he brought home a piece of the desk from his office.",
            "A friend of mind was a pilot for Singapore Airlines flying Singapore to Seattle I think he said.  He was diverted into Canada, but only told the passengers the bare minimum that they were being diverted to another airport.  It wasn't until they got inside the airport terminal and saw the TV that they understood why they were diverted. (Even he was surprised at the scale compared to what ATC told him.)\n\nHe was also the pilot in command of the first commercial aircraft to enter US airspace when it was reopened, and he recalled being terrified of deviating from his planned track.  He had an uneasy feeling in the back of his mind that there was likely an F-14 a few thousand feet above him ready to vaporise them if he moved unexpectedly.",

No announcements were made on the plane. \n\nJust as we got to the gate and people started turning their phones on, i hear phones start ringing everywhere. \"What happened....\" \"a plane hit what...\" at that point my phone started to ring as well. It was my wife wanting to make sure i wasn't on one of the planes. And she filled me in on what was known then. The pilot and cabin crew did not say anything about what happened. \n\nThere was an eerie silence in the terminal. I did not see any tv screens. I went directly to the car rental company got a car and started driving north, back to NY. Listening to the radio as much as i could the whole way back...",
            "I flew from Sweden to Turkey. Before boarding the plane I remember that everyone in the airport stood in silence watching the news on the different tv-monitors in the airport. It was a really weird feeling that it was so silent in a usually hectic place. The flight went on as usual. The attack happened just before we checked in to the airport. ",
            "My wife was flying Paris - NYC; the pilot first came on the PA and said \u201cbombs were being dropped on US soil\u201d, airspace was closed and they were diverting to Halifax because they didn\u2019t have enough fuel to return to Paris.  Then they came on and said Halifax was closed and they would have to return to France.  Hmmm...not enough fuel?  The plane landed in Brest, on the west coast of France.  No clue how much fuel the plane was left with.  My wife was put up in a very nice hotel with the rest of the Business class passengers, and was stuck for 4 very surreal days in Paris.\n\nThere was a doctor on board who was flying to NYC to do an organ transplant; he was able to access a fax machine in the cockpit to tell the medical team in NYC that he wouldn\u2019t make it and they should halt the organ harvest from the donor.  Fascinating.",
            "I was on a plane from LA to Melbourne, with a stop-over via Auckland, and 9/11 happened while we were in the air.\n\nHalfway through the flight, all the flight attendants got really nervous, and the pilot told us that due to a safety issue, the seatbelt sign was kept on throughout the flight, which we all found really confusing.\n\nWhen we landed in NZ, there were armed guards with machine guns to greet us - which is very out of the ordinary for New Zealand. The first reports the flight attendants gave us was that it was the Empire State Building that had been attacked, that was how confused initial reports were. We were luckily allowed to fly on to Melbourne, but after that all international flights were grounded for a few days . "

I once found his comics in my mom\u2019s closet when I was younger but that was about it.  It is almost like it\u2019s just a story and he wasn\u2019t a real person.

Also I had his age wrong as I realized reading his memoriam, I had taken the year he was born and the year he died and came up with 16, when in fact he died before his birthday that year, making him only 15.

A few minutes later, I realize that the smell is growing at an exponential rate and I had that terrible thought: someone shit their pants and now they\u2019re either too embarrassed to come tell me in front of their peers or scared they will get in trouble (remember, they\u2019re 5 year olds). \n\nSO, I decide my plan of attack will be to continue teaching my lesson as planned but actively walk around my classroom with and extra heightened sense of smell so I can literally \u201csniff out\u201d the kid that did this while still acting normal around all the students. Sure enough, I get to one of the tables and this one kid just smells terrible and it\u2019s obvious she did this.  I get the kids started on their art projects and ask this girl into the hall to have a chat.  I ask her if she pooped her pants and she says no.  I ask her if she\u2019s sure she didn\u2019t and she says yeah she\u2019s sure.  We go back inside the class and the smell gets even worse. A couple minutes later I ask the same girl back out in the hall and I tell her I know she pooped her pants and that she needs to go to the school nurse to get a change of clothes.  After it takes some convincing, I get her outta there and get things cleaned up on the sly so that way a lot of the other kids wouldn\u2019t find out what happened and therefore wouldn\u2019t tease the girl later.\n\nThat was a rough day.",

We talked to his mom. The nurse gave him deodorant and said he could get some whenever he needed it. They even offered to let him use the shower in the gym. Nothing helped.

I literally miss being able to work retail, and retail is a special hell of its own lol. \n\n  I'm still in my 20s and can barely walk even with my cane some days. I spent 23 years of my life in constant movement- doing physical jobs, hobbies, everything. And now I have to relearn life without that. Oh and in its place crippling pain. \n\n  Plus, you lose so many people. At first people are nice and even supportive, but then they see you aren't improving. You're a bummer to hang out with, and it's a pain to have to plan around stairs and standing too long, and seating options. People talk to you in a weirdly condescending way, like you're a slightly dumb child everyone pities. I can't support myself and help my family like I used to, my old life is as gone as my shitty body. I hate my body so much sometimes it feels like an iron maiden around me. I just want 1 day without pain, but it won't happen. \n\n  The only way to escape this pain would be to die, but then I'd be passing that pain to my spouse and family, and that's shitty too.

Big thanks to everyone for the support and suggestions, really appreciate it. Here's more info:\n\nSaw neurologist for first visit, I'll go back in 2 weeks. Among blood tests they did, ANA was negative, C reactive protein was mildly elevated at 5.8mg/L. B12 normal, vitamin D barely low but I'm correcting that.\n\nBrain MRI report mentions no lesions, but I have substantial belief I found something the radiologist overlooked and plan to discuss it with my doctor at next visit. Understanding the anatomy right, I believe there to be a substantial dark lesion and nearby enhancement from contrast in my left cerebellum peduncle, near the brain stem. If anyone's curious, it's posted [here](https://i.imgur.com/Wki72B8.jpg). I don't believe that can be explained by normal anatomy, but I'm not a doctor.\n\nI do have visual symptoms. My night vision is a bit degraded, I notice blurriness, especially around lights. I seem to have normal vision during daytime. Not sure about color balance, or if one eye is worse than the other.\n\nEdit 2: I believe my color vision is slightly worse in my left eye. When I compare the two, colors look slightly dull.\n\nHad a nuclear scan of dopamine centers to rule out parkinsons. It was negative.\n\nEven if I'm right and what I found is a lesion, it's only 1 lesion and I know the diagnosis process can be complicated. Neurologist is going to do CSF analysis and peripheral nerve studies as well. it may be a while before I get a formal diagnosis, if it is indeed MS.",

            "Not a cop but I've got a story. I already posted it to /r/storiesaboutkevin so if you've seen it before, that's where.\n\nA little over a month ago my apartment was broken into whilst my Boyfriend was still inside. He works nights so at midday he's still fast asleep and didn't notice this guy come in and rummage around until he throws the bedroom door open, panics at seeing my BF, and runs off.\n\nMy BF looks around the apartment and find that the laptops, tablets etc are still there and he must hae run off before getting to all that, but a handful of smaller valuables such as USB's, keys, Wallets were gone. He also did a fair amount of damage rummaging around and spray-painting our walls. Also ate our biscuits.\n\nWhat WAS there however, were the idiots bags.\n\nHe'd left his school rucksack containing some schoolwork, some of our possessions, his ID, some years old school papers with his parents phone numbers on it etc...\n\nSo already he's an idiot, we know who he is. The police are having a laugh with us a little later about it, and as one of them takes my BF's statement, we hear a knock at the door. I go to answer it as a friend said he was coming over anyway and I find the same guy from the ID outside my door.\n\nHe looks at me, then at the police officer behind me (still holding the bags) and asks:\n\n\"Can I have my bags back please?\"\n\nAfter a stunned moment, he's grabbed by the police officer and my BF confirms that this is the guy. He's arrested on the spot.\n\nThe police said it was the dumbest thing they'd ever seen, like something out of a sit-com. It made local news.",

I detain them and sure enough they had a couple Coronas and some off brand whiskey. I confirm with CVS they were the suspects, the alcohol was their property, and they are desirous of prosecution.  All is good, my state requires I take them to the station to book into jail and get fingerprinted, then they are issued a citation and released with a court date a couple months out. \n\nWhile driving to the station I ask what they were doing stealing the alcohol. One guy says that they are only 20 and since they weren\u2019t old enough to buy it, they just decided to steal it instead. No big deal, young people make stupid mistakes.  I get to the jail, book them in and start filling out the citation. The citation requires both birthdate and age. I do the math on the birthday, and sure enough the guy is 21. Meaning he is old enough to buy alcohol. I go back into the jail and verify his birthday. Yup, same one he had listed on his drivers license. I re-do the math out loud. 21 years old. I ask \u201chow old are you again?\u201d  He replies \u201c20 sir.\u201d  I said \u201cyou turned 21 last month.\u201d  Again he is adamant \u201cno I turned 20.\u201d  I just left it at that...\n\nTldr; Guy stole beer because he forgot his age and thought he wasn\u2019t old enough to buy it.

They seemed to have dropped damn near everything while running because there was literally a trail of broken glass leading to the apartment accross the street. Cops came, followed the glass trail leading directly to someones door. Looked over the little fence to their bottom floor balcony and saw 3 guys all cut up smoking from a broken bong.

            "Being around driven and accomplished people. \n\nI realized the joy they felt after they accomplished a milestone was far greater than any happiness I felt by doing nothing. When they rested they *rested* and when they partied they partied hard. It was amazing to see people living edge to edge on life and pushing themselves to their limits because *they can*.\n\nAnd I've always wondered what can I do? It may not be as great as them, but it's better than if I'd done nothing. And I can build on successes.",
            "Changed my method of thinking.\n\n- Do a task while I'm thinking about it and just be done with it. Gets it out of my mind and I no longer need to be thinking about it.\n\n- Do not paralyze myself into inactivity. It doesn't need to be done perfectly, it just needs to be done. I can always revisit and look for ways of improving or being more efficient.  \n\n- Challenge your brain to be hyper efficient. How you can optimize your time in a given moment, to get the max things that need to get done in the shortest amount of time. You have 10 things that need to get done, you only completed 5. You still completed 5 things. Next time, you have a target for improvement.\n\n- Use laziness as a reward and not a barrier. I reward myself with doing nothing for 3 hours, once I've cleared off all my tasks. Few things feel better, than doing absolutely nothing with a clear mind.\n\n- I pretend I have a drill sergeant in my brain and I'm in boot camp. Every time I am tempted to leave something until later, the drill sergeant tells me that is not an option. To get the fuck moving and get shit done NOW. And then I get it done because I don't want to \"be that guy\" that can't seem to leave things better than I found them.\n\n- Finally, appreciate the effort. When you do something, give yourself some credit. That shit matters. Remind yourself that taking care of your life, in all aspects of it, is a benefit to you. YOU are worth taking care of. Lazy is a label, it's not a word that defines who you are. You are either doing what needs to be done, or you make the choice not to. Make the choice to do it. Be proud of how productive you are while feeling good about the mindset.\n\nYou can do this.",

            "About the big stuff, I realized I wasn't really lazy, I was just afraid of failure and lacked confidence. I think my subconscious logic was that I shouldn't bother to try because I was likely to fail and end up in the same place anyway, so why put in the effort?\n\nAs clich\u00e9 as it sounds, what got me out of that was to start to think of \"failures\" as just practice runs for whatever I wanted so I could learn to do it again differently until I got it right. I also tried to train myself to feel excited about the potentially positive outcomes, rather than dwelling of the dispiriting nature of the possible negative ones. \n\nAnother simple thing that keeps me trying is thinking about what my PhD advisor said about applying for grants, which are so much work and competitive now it sometimes can feel like it's not worth the effort: \"There is only one way I know to guarantee that you won't get a grant, and that's not to apply for it at all.\" It's a pretty good counter to my old argument of \"why try if I am going to fail anyway?\"",

            "One recent revelation that I had about motivation and action was that soooo much of what I decided to do was very much based on whether or not I was sitting. Sounds kinda dumb, but, you know. Do I need more water? Yeah, but I'll get it next time I get up. Do I need to check my work email? Yeah, but I'll check it next time I get up. Do I need to chop those veggies for dinner? Yeah, but I'll do it when I get up.\n\n\nIt's inertia. I don't want to put in the effort to start something if I'm already at rest. I enjoy rest. Rest is comfy. Rest feels nice. So, I started to turn it to my advantage, at least a little. I sit on my ass, at rest, for as long as I please. Eventually, I will have to get up. Everybody's gotta go to the bathroom sometime, right? So instead of just going to the bathroom, doing one thing while I'm up, I do two things. Doesn't matter what they are. I'm standing, so I'm in action. Take care of whatever forced me to get up, then do something I know I also need to do. I don't push myself, or go on cleaning sprees or anything, but once I'm up I just think, \"might as well do this while I'm up.\"\nSilly little idea, but it's been working for me. And then when I've done TWO THINGS, I return to my sitting-on-my-ass position. Until the next time when I will accomplish two more things.\n\n\nOlder revelation: squeaky wheel theory.\nI have a theory that there are big stressors and little stressors in our lives. You got the big ones: money, jobs, relationships, etc. The ones that individually feel like they're enormous, life-fucking stress bullets aimed directly at our brains. Then you got the little ones: bookshelf that's crooked, squeaky door hinges, etc. The shit that you notice all the time, every day, but never take action to change... because you think you should be working on the big stress stuff. But big stress shit doesn't change in a day, a week, a month, or years. Sometimes the big ones are just a part of life forever. What happens is that eventually, you ignore the little shit, because what's a squeaky door mean to you when you're in a lot of debt, or your relationship is on the rocks? Why bother with it?\n\n\nHere's why: because stress adds up. For a mathematical metaphor, let's say you're in debt, and that debt-stress is causing a massive 30 pounds of stress that isn't going to go away anytime soon. Then you have a shitty job where you hate your boss and loathe going into work every morning. 40 pounds of stress right there, and it ain't changing anytime soon. That's a lot of stress. But then you have that squeaky door, but that's just annoying and inconsequential -- but it's still 1 pound of stress. Then you have that bookshelf that's one inch lower on one side, but that's not a biggie -- but it's still 1 pound of stress. And you really should clean your bathtub, but no hurry -- but it's still 1 pound of stress. And then there's that mess on the table that you should really clean up, that's maybe a 2-pounder. And then you have, well, 80 other 1-pound stressors in your life. Added up, that's about as much as the few big stressors.\n\n\nThe main point is that probably a good half of all the stress we feel can be fixed in, like, two hours. Money problems ain't gonna be fixed on a Tuesday night at 9:30pm, but by golly, you can WD-40 the shit out of that annoying door hinge in like 20 seconds. You can slide a block of wood under the side of the off-center bookshelf in 30 seconds. How long does that dirty tub take to clean, 2 minutes? Just take an hour a week, maybe two hours a week. Deal with the little shit, and I guarantee you that your world will get better. The big stuff will still bother you, but that's okay. It'll just mean that there's not 80 tiny things hanging maliciously over your head all the goddamn time. For the low, low cost of an hour a week.\n\nEDIT: Okay, I guess *don't* use WD-40 on hinges, use a proper lubricant.\n\nEDIT: For all you *supremely* lazy people:\n\nTL;DR:\n\n1. Be lazy in bursts. Then when you are *forced* to be not-lazy by something, do two non-lazy things instead of just one.\n\n2. Big stress things are hard to fix. Try fixing the small stress things a bit at a time, because they add up just as harshly as the big ones. Oil the squeaky hinges of your life when you can't buy a whole new door.",

My personal theory is that it was such a disaster for government planning that everyone bought into, there is a sense of loss of face so no one wants to bring it up. Not sure what light it's painted in in Chinese textbooks as I left the country as I was entering gradeschool.\n\n-edit-\n\nIn a modern context and a much lighter note, many of my friends who grew up in China and never went abroad know nothing about the Western meme culture.

For comparison, I was aware of Tiananmen as it was talked about, as a child.\n\n2) If you're telling me to pay attention, please extend me the same courtesy and pay attention to the fact that I specifically said that I left China as I was entering 1st grade, well before this would have been taught.

            "Chinese immigrant here. My family has political ties so I heard more propaganda than usual. It\u2019s common for people to join the communist party to get ahead in life, connections are pretty important.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was that people outside China seem to hate/dislike China so much.\n\nInside the country, the focus of our education was less about censorship but more about propaganda aka China is BEST PLACE EVER. All 5000+ years of beautiful art and heroes etc. That\u2019s why so many Chinese people will defend China so passionately, and ignore any contradictory facts. No need for censorship because people were already non-receptive to any bad things said about their dear motherland.\n\nAnyway that\u2019s why it\u2019s extra shocking to hear people hate on a place that felt like the BEST. Even knowing all the facts now, most Chinese people will only appear to be \u2018enlightened\u2019, to fit in = not make trouble or cause people to judge them. Secretly they remain loyal to China. It\u2019s like this: imagine if you had a great childhood (subjectively) and your mom loved you and you loved her. Then imagine some strangers present \u2018concrete evidence\u2019 that your mom is a terrible person and did terrible things. Can you hate her? Agree with the strangers? Just toss away all the good memories?\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for the rewards, internet strangers! Some context:\n\nThis is my perspective based on personal experiences. Due to the geographic and population size of China, you'll see huge variety in the stories people tell. My family's upper-middle class (doctors, engineers, professors, a few local government officials), so they're fairly educated, living in the capital of China - Beijing. A farmer or those overnight Chinese millionaires will have very different views.\n\n**Why immigrate?** Because engineers get paid a lot in Silicon valley, and my parents went to California on vacation and loved the weather there. Other common reasons: too much pollution/not enough nature or there's too much competition in school for their kids --> problems of overpopulated cities. Political refugees or people escaping from poverty immigrate for better lives aka \"the American dream\".\n\n**When do Chinese people learn the truth?** Largely depends on the family, the person, and your location. Curious teenagers in major cities will start to question things and vault over the firewall. But if you have any family in the military, or you have zero interest in politics/history (like my cousins who just play games on their phones everyday), or you're a rural factory worker - you'll probably never know the truth.\n\n**Were/are people in China happy?** Yeah, people are adaptive and most have no points of comparison. My parents lived through periods of intense communism where they barely had enough to eat (and there's much more state control and extreme dystopian measures than today), but still they ENJOYED that time. For example, nobody could be 'fired' from their jobs - they had absolute job security and 'assigned' jobs = no stress at work. Most people were equally poor and happy. Now everyone's standard of living is going up, but new problems arose...corruption/bribery/jealousy/over-consumption/unemployment/wealth gap/dangerous business practices/competing with neighbors (who has fancier car or child going to Ivy league). Now life is really stressful - again, based on their personal experiences. Everyone has their own lenses to see the world.",

I knew people who had insights about the living condition in the \"re-educational\" camp where they hold the cult members in my city, at least it wasn't too bad in my city, it sounded like somewhere between a prison and a summer camp.\n\nI already knew people in HK hated China, only because I watched Japanese TV while I was traveling in Japan with my parents, summer 1997 when the CCP got HK back to China from UK.\n\nI already knew the CCP army surrenders in Korean war had the choice to be released to Taiwan and many many of them chose so. Only because my grandfather went and fought in combats during the entire war.\n\nI was a teenager who was a rebel and felt oppressed so I did my fair part of research, plus I had the advantage of knowing people who participated such historical events in person. But I doubt the majorities of Chinese would care to learn as much as as I did. Sometimes being ignorant and dumb is a blessing if you are stuck in a situation you can't change.\n\nWhat I did not know was how CCP did little to nothing during the WW2 in order to preserve power, while the Nationalist party gave everything to defend the country. Later CCP won the civil war by brainwashing the uneducated majorities, then twisted the whole story totally to the opposite in history textbooks and forced generations of people to believe the CCP was the legitimate ruler. The CCP even promoted for the idea of having multiple political parties to avoid tyranny and corruption, up until they took over China and took a huge turn.",

He's terribly inbred, and kind of a lunatic. He doesn't keep concepts like \"don't do this or you get in trouble\" in his head (we tried training him, we've never had a problem doing this for any cat in the past), and he thinks the proper response to anything he doesn't like is to rear up on his hind legs and attack, thankfully without claws or teeth. But that does include simply walking past and not feeding him. He's just a small ball of uncomprehending, cross-eyed rage and poor wiring. He also runs into walls and furniture constantly, and he loses his little crippled shit over balled up paper, which often *causes* him to run into walls and furniture. He sleeps in the paper recycling bin with all our junk mail. He doesn't paw at doors, he licks them.\n\nWe adopted another cat, about 6 months older than him, in January. The other cat is like the dictionary example of perfect feline poise and prowess. When he is standing absolutely still. Otherwise he's every single episode of Jackass and Fast & Furious movie crammed into 14 pounds of pure muscle. We have wood floors throughout most of the house, linoleum and tile elsewhere, with a few carpets. He hurls himself around at warp 9.9 everywhere. His feet aren't even under him most of the time, he just slides around. He's a thief, and he takes whatever he's stolen down to the basement. We haven't found his stash yet. He prefers to be held upside down, with his head and paws dangling. If you try to pick him up normally he'll twist in your arms until he's in that position.\n\nIt wouldn't be so bad if they got along. The smaller cat wants to play, but he weighs a whole 6 pounds, so the bigger one just knocks him around. They can't even play with toys together because the smaller one is also nearsighted. If we have the laser pointer out the bigger one becomes the fucking Predator, and the smaller one loses it 10 seconds later, and stands around confused.\n\nWe love them both, very dearly, but they are the absolute worst and most entertaining cats. Currently they have to be kept separate while we do physical therapy on the smaller one in preparation for surgery to repair his patellas.

            "This has been a thought of mine for many years.  I am a Christian and a father who loves his family.  Since I became a father later in life, I would never think about having an abortion. However, Mercy, common sense and empathy dictate that you have to think about each case of unwanted pregnancy on an individual basis and provide appropriate advice and support to the mother and the baby. Many people who are out there fighting to stop abortions are not really pro-life...  they are pro-birth. Once the baby is born, many could care less what happens to it. Pro-life is for LIFE.  In fact many anti-abortion activists also want to eliminate most social programs designed to help people take care of unwanted babies, such as: help with adoption costs, provide quality housing and educations to both the mother and child in order to try and get them out of poverty, providing free childcare while the mother goes to school or until her income can pay for it without making both her and her baby homeless...In essence, expand the social net to ensure the well being of the child who\u2019s life you so zealously defend. Adequately fund and monitor state run foster care in order to ensure that the child is being raised in a safe environment in order to protect against physical and sexual abuse and assault. You can\u2019t buy love but as a society we can at least provide a good education and a decent upbringing. No one wants a pit bull that has been chained up, abused, untrained and hungry set loose in their back yard, but many people fail to see that in failing to provide a stable,caring, nurturing environment for these unwanted kids, we are creating monsters who are far more dangerous,cunning and scary than a mere dog.        TL:DR. : Take care of the mother and baby like they were your family or at least how you would want your family treated if you couldn\u2019t do it yourself. As a society, we would all be better off.

The child had been sick for a few days that turned into a couple weeks. The teachers told the parents over and over something was wrong. The parents ignored the signs and claimed it was nothing bad or it was a cold, something minor, etc. \n\nThey finally came to me and the child showed signs of Measles. Within about 10-15mins I indicated that this is not a cold and this seemed to be measles(based on what they verbalized to me and what I saw). To confirm, I examined the child's inner cheek and did a full body exam where she (the child not the parents) pointed out a rash both confirming Measles. \n\nThe parents indicated that they did not believe in Vaccines because their previous doctor told them it was unnecessary as long as the child ate healthy and stayed active (it was a family friend who worked in Naturopathic medicine, not a licensed doctor). After making the diagnosis and having a very tough conversation and informational session with the parents, I provided them with prescriptions to help with the measles and bring as much comfort as possible to their child. I had to break down that their child: 1. Couldve infected children and families with a very dangerous but preventable disease, 2. Couldve had permanent brain/nerve damage and 3. Could have fucking died(I didn't curse at them but boy did I want to). \n\nThe child had Measles for at least a month before seeing me. To show how serious this is, Measles does not show signs or symptoms in some cases for 10-14 days. So because they refused to vaccinate their child, at least 2-3 weeks of exposure to other kids and teachers went by. Somehow they were able to bypass school district requirements for getting vaccines (they did NOT have a religious exemption). \n\n\n",

I didn't actually have the heart (or felt there was any reason in the moment) to explain to the parents that what was happening to their child was fully preventable. \n\nLong story short; their child came into the emergency room, quite febrile, and non-responsive. The whole work-up was done and he was diagnosed with HiB meningitis and sepsis and was admitted to the NICU. Unfortunately he was already fairly advanced into the course of his illness and went on to develop multiple awful complications. Despite being started on the kitchen sink's worth of antibiotics, he developed multiple brain empyemas (large collection of pus and bacteria that fill the skull), requiring multiple drains to be drilled into their skull to relieve pressure (or else the brain would have been compressed). To make things worse, the kid incurred multiple ischemic strokes (dead brain) and also developed hydrocephalus (the brain has its own 'circulatory' system which can get clogged with pus / bacteria causing fluid to build up and exerting pressure on the brain).\n\nAgainst all odds, this tiny baby survived the ordeal. You can have your own ethical debate over whether a child that neurologically compromised should have lived, since they will be so profoundly disabled that they will likely require full-time nursing care, and may only live a few more years before dying of pneumonia, but that was the situation.\n\nEdit: grammar",

I don\u2019t remember pressure, but as you can imagine it was astronomically high. We got the kid as stable as we could and transferred him to the PICU. He ended up living, but lost three of his extremities due to sepsis. As well as severe cognitive impairment as a result of the high pressures. Cultures showed H flu meningitis, which is the most common form of meningitis. He was never vaccinated. The HIB vaccine is > 95% effective in preventing meningitis. It was sobering to watch the parents realize their decision to withhold a vaccine has unimaginably altered the course of their lives and the life of their child. \n",
            "Not necessarily anti-vaxx, but a sad story related to not wanting to listen to the doctors mixed in with not being a good parent.\n\nI'm in medical school when this happened. Seeing a new patient to establish care. Patient is a nine year old girl. Get into the room and she is on the table wearing glasses. Okay that's cool, I had glasses at a young age also. Then I notice she has strabismus (is cross-eyed). Talk to the mother to get better history.\n\nTurns out she was born with strabismus. Now, there is a relatively easy way to fix this. Involves surgery and then wearing an eye patch. For most people, this fixes the issue and their vision is unaffected.\n\nThe mother was against the surgery, but was someone finally convinced her that it would help so she got it done. Patient was sent home and mother was given specific instructions...keep the eye patch on constantly. Well, guess what? Eye patch isn't exactly comfortable and kid gets fussy all the time and doesn't want to keep it on. So mom decides not to make her wear it. Strabismus returns.\n\nBy the time I saw her, the patient's vision was terrible, and she was almost legally blind (she could read the big E on the eye chart, nothing else. And that was with 1 month old glasses). She is cross eyed. I inform the mother that they can get the surgery again, it will help prevent her vision from worsening and help with being cross-eyed. Mother says the surgery is cosmetic, and the eye patch is too bothersome so she doesn't want to do it.\n\nThis nine year old girl is on track to become legally blind in the next couple of years. She will remain cross-eyed for the rest of her life. All because her mother couldn't be a parent and force her to wear an eye patch for a couple of months.\n\nTurns out there is other evidence of bad parenting. Kid brushes here teeth maybe once a week because mother doesn't make her brush her teeth if she doesn't want to.\n\nLong story short...if you are a parent, be a fucking parent."
