    "post": "I have been at it 6 hours trying to do it myself.  My lawyer has a guy that does it for $2,500 - but that is way out of my wheelhouse.  I'd pay for help if the video was recovered, but I'm not the kind of guy with more than $500 to \"play\" with.  I know your time is valuable, so let me know what you need to do it.  I will answer any questions you have up-front and with pure honesty.\n\nEDIT:  Anybody in the Houston area I will come to personally.\nEDIT 2:  All good advice got gold, I left a comment asking for PayPal info to compensate the best of the thread.  Thank you.  Please send me your PayPal info.\n\nEDIT 3:  Got up to take a piss at 2:30am, and holy shit.  Let me clarify a few things.  1) I was not belligerent - not until I had the knee in my face - then it was mostly \"what the fuck.\"  2) I don't care to waste my time suing anyone who doesn't deserve it.  Karma in real life might actually be a real thing.  3)  I don't need to beat a DUI.  They took the blood without an arrest and without a warrant.  In Texas, that gets suppressed with a quickness.  4)If I was acting like a belligerent asshole,  show me one cop that wouldn't take me in right then.  5) Regardless of all that other BS and the court of Reddit administering a verdict, I still really, really need this video.\n\nEDIT 4:  2 things - 1... I am working through all of your suggestions (making a list now, setting up in the morning). PHONE IS OFF.  I had 20GB of free space on the internal.  No SD, no Cloud, No Hamster.  2....  I know as much as the next guy how people can be on the internet.  That's not me.  Know why?  Because I'm trying to get the video back, that's why.  What the fuck would I want of a video of me deservedly getting attacked after treating a medical team like shit?  \"I'm Rob Lowe and this is Dickhead Asshat Doctor Provoking Rob Lowe with cable?\"\n\nEDIT 5 (Tuesday): No rooting programs are working.  I copied every folder from my phone to my computer.  It turns out that Verizon's SM-N910V has something called a bootblocker or some shit like that.  So I am on to manually try this out.\n\nEDIT 6 (Tuesday Afternoon):  There is no way to root this phone without dealing with a bootloader or something that every forum says we have to wait for.  I contacted a Data Forensics company in Austin that might be able to do something, but if I have to go that route I am going to have to wait until I get paid on the 15th.  They are going to call me back sometime today to let me know if they can even do anything.  Meanwhile, any suggestions that require the phone to be rooted are no good.  I can't thank y'all enough, though.  I'll deliver something as soon as I figure out what I need to do next.\n\nEDIT 7 (Tuesday still):  I have a call with the guy from Austin at 2pm or so Central - I'll let y'all know what he thinks.\n\nEDIT 8 (Tues.):  They are going to email me some detailed info regarding what they do to get the video.  Obviously, I probably won't understand one fucking detail, but I'll post it here.  For now, you guys stay awesome.  I need to get some work done.\n\nEDIT 9:  YOU GUYS ARE ABOVE-AVERAGE!!!!  A company in Oklahoma just offered to forensically recover the video for me as pro-bono, pro-civil right, just plain badass way to help me out.  Once again, no matter what....  I will post the video as soon as I can, no matter how it makes me look.   I am Fed-Exing the phone there this afternoon.\n\nEDIT 10:  Continuing my policy of \"surely delivering\" I give you a copy of the [overnight shipping receipt.](http://imgur.com/xCeaNpf)\n\nEDIT 11:  Not much new today to report except that my phone arrived at the Data Forensics facility.  FedEx Tracking 807519987715\n\nEDIT 12:  Wednesday activities:  Phone will be dumped by Thursday morning when recovery work will commence.\n\nEDIT 13:  Got an email this morning (Thursday) saying they are recovering the data today.  That does not mean shit to the great reveal.  I made the mistake of scrolling too low in some of the other threads this ended up on, and I am not having my integrity questioned anymore - at least where I can do something about it.  [This is my Uber receipt](http://imgur.com/iRjEBul) from the night of the incident showing that I went HOME and did not, as some claim, have a DWI that I am just covering up for.  Check the address, it is the hospital - not the jail.\n\nEDIT 14:  I had another update from the guys in OKC with my phone.  They were able to pull a lot of old contacts, messages, etc. from my phone, but no video.  They want to use a new code they have for this new phone (Verizon Note 4) to see what they can get.  They estimate a Tuesday completion.  That does not mean I am going to upload the video if I get it right away.  My attorney and ABC-13 in Houston are going to make sure that anything I upload does not violate HIPPA laws.  I am here for any other questions anyone has, but you have to be as patient as I am before I upload the video.  I spoke with my attorney today and he is being very cautious about how we go about this.  I got a copy of my medical records from that night which are full of contradictory statements.  You all can expect no updates over the weekend.  Not because I am being deceptive, but mostly because my attorney has a newborn, I need to catch up with my job, and the guys in OKC don't work over the weekend.  This is going to be a process, and as much as I want to deliver ASAP, the data is going to be delivered and the story develops --- and that shit takes time.  I am always available to answer questions if you message me.\n\nEDIT 15 (Monday Night):  Nothing new to report.  Last Friday I was told that there would be either a yes or no on recovery by close of business on Tuesday.  I'm not rushing anybody, so I didn't ask for an update today.  I probably will tomorrow.  I see all of the \"RemindMe\" things, and I want you all to know that it is still in the works.  The sheer amount of professionalism going into this is going to be a valuable addition to the people on this sub that I intended to interact with before this blew up.  I think we are all going to be in a position to learn \"real(ish) time\" how they are handling this.  I don't know dick-one about what is going on technically with my phone, but I'm sure we'll get some insight soon.\n\nEDIT 16 (Tuesday Night):  There is still nothing new to report.  \n\nEDIT 17 (Wednesday Afternoon):  The email from the data forensics company:\n\n>Hello again Reddit friend,\n>\n>Long story short, you are boned. Our forensic devices were able to semi-dump this phone, but the video you are looking for was not in the dumps.\n>\n>So here is the long story. The Verizon Note 4 is bootloader locked with no known exploit. It has several security systems in place to make sure you (the owner) don't get to do anything with the phone that Samsung and VZW dont approve of, UNLESS you buy the Verizon Note 4 'Developer Edition'. The reason that this matters to you, is that there is no way currently to access a full bit-for-bit copy of the internal storage.\n\n>Our resident Android Guru has been working on this solid since we got your phone (partly because of the almost $15000 reward for it), but is up against a wall as well.\n>\n>In effect, you are out of luck on recovering the video until an exploit is found for this phone (which it may or may not ever be). Your options are to keep the phone safe and unused somewhere until the phones security is broken, or to move on.\n>\n>I wish we had better news, and I wish that Android phone manufacturers would keep these open source phones open, and not locked like Fort Knox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Knox).\n\n>Please get me your shipping address and we will overnight the phone back to you. I am sorry, and I know this is not what you were hoping for, us either!\n\nThey also included a spreadsheet breaking down the bounty for unlocking the phone.  Either way, this is good information for this sub, I'd assume, and bad for the people with the pictchforks and such.  My attorney is still moving forward, and that is going to be a long process, so if your \"RemindMe\" shit doesn't have \"months\" somewhere in it, you can forget that.\n\nSeriously, the internet is awesome when you look at it from the standpoint of I cane to this sub to get a result and I got one (good or bad).  It sucks when apparently I became a \"Karma Whore\" somewhere in here.  You all can think what you want, but seriously, how does this matter to your life?  Stop being so cynical.  In the words of [Conan O'Brien.](http://youtu.be/AcF1OoWqXBc?t=3m47s)\n\nEDIT 18 (Feb 16):  Some of y'all need to get a life.  I'm not some cop-bashing anti-anything attention seeker.  I came here for a tech support issue and got exactly that.  If the result isn't what you had hoped for, too goddamned bad, go upstairs and cry to your mom.  The people who help out in here are awesome, and shouldn't have to deal with some of you terrible, terrible human beings who for whatever reason think that the reading and commenting on a story makes them somehow entitled to anything. Nobody owes you shit, get used to it.  \n\nFinal Outcome (November):  The company from Oklahoma tried to get the video out of the phone for no charge and could not get it. I knew that the hospital had cameras and I tried to get a lawyer where I am to take the case on a contingency fee basis which was unsuccessful. Not an exciting conclusion to the story, but it is what it is.  Thank you all, I hope you all have a happy holiday season.\n\nSuper Three-Year-Later Edit: This pissed me off so much, I went to law school and became an attorney and now do defense work in Texas. \n\nSuper Duper Edit - This turned into a radio episode, and yes, apparently you can edit this shit in perpetuity. http://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2018/09/07/tim-from-texas",

      "I want to clarify the story.  I was on the way home from the Super Bowl at a bar in Houston.  I was not drinking as my first day of my new job was today.  I was driving through a residential area when I got clipped by someone.  I spun out, hit a curb and lost my right back tire.  No airbags, but I bounced my head around pretty good.  The police showed up along with a lot of very nice people.  The cop there checked me out and recommended that I go on the ambulance.  He asked if I had been drinking, I said no, and asked if he wanted to test me out.  He did not.  I got to the hospital laying there for 2 hours when I decided that I wanted to go.  I have Uber and I was refusing all treatment asking to leave.  The doc wanted to give me a CT Scan, but I did not want to spend the money on it as I was currently uninsured (new job and new insurance today).  I said I was refusing all treatment and I wanted to leave.  The video is of me standing at my door asking the staff to let me leave as I was coherent and able to answer all of their questions, and had a ride home.  They had 2 sheriffs there for whatever reason and when they saw I was recording my request they all attacked, one dude put his knee into my eye socket and had me strapped to the bed while they force drew blood from me.  The thing is, in Texas, you need to be legally arrested and be served a search warrant to have your blood drawn.  They did not.  The police refused to act on the assault and after the analyzed the blood they let me walk out.  One of the nurses grabbed my phone and deleted my video.",
      "I don't know how far you're willing to go (and trust a stranger), but I work in data forensics and have access to an [MPE](http://accessdata.com/solutions/digital-forensics/mpe).  I could pull everything off for you.  I'm not in Texas, so you'd have to mail me your device.  Probably more than is feasible.\n\n[Here's sort of proof of what I do](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/comments/qpilb/27usa_traveling_data_forensics_professional_edc/), a post I submitted ~3 years ago.\n\nEdit: disregard everything above.  You're in Texas and data forensics from Texas require specific licensing that I do not have.\n\nAnd just FYI, $2,500 is a huge cost for the kind of work that needs to be done.  $350/hour is a standard charge for VP-level involvement. I actually know a guy who does forensic work in Texas since a specific P.I. license is needed in the state.  I could put you in contact with him.",
      "put it down and don't touch it until you have help from someone. I can't personally help you but i know that much.\n\nyou don't want to accidentally overwrite something and make it unrecoverable. put it down. don't touch it.",
      "turn it off. the more data that gets put on and off the drive further  eliminate the chance that it is recoverable. turn the thing off pull the battery and call a drive recovery expert, it will cost you though.",
      "I just want to be clear.  You wizards help me get this and I'll pay you something.  I'll also publish the video, regardless of how stupid I look in it.",
      "I would say it's worth it to do a professional recovery.  You might even be able to claim the $2,500  as a loss incured to recover from malicious destruction of property  (Unauthorized forcible deletion of your property from your phone  that was also evidence of a civil offense and possibly a crime).\n\nIt would be nice to be able to say that deleting or damaging the patient/visitor's phone or content cost them an extra $3000.\n\n",
      "**Stop using the phone and turn it off**\n\nIf the video was saved to sd card, pull it out and recover it via a pc. Feel free to use any of the non-modifying tools recommended, but do NOT install any apps. \n\nThe guy your lawyer knows probably uses a [Cellebrite](http://www.cellebrite.com/) for recovery. Everything this machine does is repeatable manually afaik, but you will need a serious expert.",

Please make a post instead. Your files are at stake.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Purpose & Scope of this Guide:**\n\nThis guide is designed to assist you in removing malware from an infected system *that successfully boots*. If your computer is completely unable to boot due to malware, please make a post, as this guide will not help you. If you perform the following steps exactly as described, this will solve your problem in over 90% of scenarios. That said, not all malware is created equal, and not all malware removal tools are created equal. The tools recommended in this guide were picked because of their high success and low failure rates, measured on a very large scale. However, there will be times that this guide fails in removing malware. If that is the case, please make a post for further assistance, stating that this guide was unsuccessful. It is recommended to only accept advice from a \u201cTrusted\u201d technician. I am writing this guide in layman\u2019s terms so that most people will be able to understand it with ease.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThe following instructions are recommendations only. You take full responsibility for any steps you choose to perform on your computer. While the following recommendations are performed without issue on countless machines, there is always a risk of damaging your Operating System or experiencing data loss on any machine. **It is solely YOUR responsibility to save all work and back up any and all important data on your system before proceeding.** Also note that once a computer has been compromised with malware, it should not be considered clean until a complete reformat has taken place.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Malware Remediation Steps:**\n\n*Before proceeding, go into your browser\u2019s extensions and remove all suspicious items. Also go into your browser\u2019s settings and remove any default search providers and unusual homepages. If you are unsure how to do this, proceed to Step 1.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Download and run the following tools in this order. Run all tools unless otherwise instructed. All tools should be run in Normal Mode (not Safe Mode) unless you are unable to boot Normal Mode, or the scans fail in Normal Mode. All tools must be run under an Administrator account. Do not remove any tool-generated logs in the event a helper needs you to post them to further assist you.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**1) Run [rkill.com](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/dl/10/). Sometimes it takes a few minutes to finish. Do not reboot when done.**\n\n* Kills running malicious processes\n\n* Removes policies in the registry that prevent normal OS operation\n\n* Repairs file extension hijacks\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2) Download an updated copy [Malwarebytes 3.0](https://downloads.malwarebytes.org/file/mbam_current/). Turn on the \u201c[Scan for Rootkits](https://i.imgur.com/nYxdVDq.png)\u201d option. Then, run a \u201c[Scan](http://i.imgur.com/X1t78tZ.png)\u201d**\n\n* Successfully removes the vast majority of infections\n* Has an industry-leading built-in rootkit/bootkit scanning engine\n* Has built-in repair tools to fix damage done by malware\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**3) Run [Malwarebytes ADWCleaner](https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/) using the \u201c[Scan](https://i.imgur.com/448N4mn.png)\u201d option.**\n\n* Removes majority of adware, PuPs, Toolbars, and Browser hijacks\n* Fixes proxy settings changed by malware\n* Removes certain non-default browser settings\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**NOTE: It is no longer necessary to run JRT. The JRT definitions have been rolled into ADWCleaner by Malwarebytes. JRT no longer provides additional benefit.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Optional, Advanced Step (only run if previous tools fail to solve problem):**\n\n**4) Run Sophos [HitmanPro](http://get.hitmanpro.com/)**\n\n* [Here](http://i.imgur.com/qVs3f3n.png) is HitmanPro.\n\nHitmanPro is a phenomenal \"second-opinion\" malware scanner.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Please note:** If malware has prohibited you from browsing the web or downloading files, you can try running the [NetAdapter Repair Tool](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/netadapter-repair-all-in-one/)  with [all options checked](http://i.imgur.com/XLv1ZUW.png) which will attempt to restore your internet connection & default browser settings. You may have to download these tools on another computer and move them to a flash drive that you can plug into the infected machine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Have adware or spyware on your Mac?**\n\nTry [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac (formerly Adware Medic)](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mac-download/). Please make a post if it is unsuccessful.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you have run all of the above tools successfully, you should be malware-free. If you are still experiencing problems, please make a post in /r/techsupport for further assistance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Follow-up Steps (highly recommended):**\n\n* Using a computer that has not been infected, change passwords to all your online accounts. \n* Consider enabling two-factor authentication.\n* Install a better anti-virus. See recommendations below.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What is malware?**\n\n[Malware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, including computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. [Source: Wikipedia.com]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How did I get infected?**\n\nIt is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher\u2019s website directly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How to prevent future infections:**\n\nBe very careful what you download and install. Keep programs like Java & Flash up-to-date, but do so using their official websites or [Ninite](http://ninite.com) installers. Use [Unchecky](http://unchecky.com/) to prevent accidental installation of adware & spyware during product installations. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The following tools will aide you in keeping your computer clean:**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Free Anti-Virus Suggestions:**\n\n* [Malwarebytes 3.0](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/) (Next-generation anti-virus replacement)\n* [BitDefender](http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html)\n* [ESET Free Online Scanner](http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/)\n* [Avast](https://www.avast.com/en-us/index)\n\n**Helpful Tools:**\n\n\n* [Malwarebytes 3.0](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/) (Next-generation anti-virus replacement)\n* [Unchecky](http://unchecky.com/) (Unchecks options in installers that install PuPs)\n* [uBlock Origin Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) (Blocks ads)\n* [TronScript](https://reddit.com/r/TronScript) (FOSS - Automates malware removal and system cleanup)",

    "post": " \n\nI've been a huge fan of Google up until now; I bought 3 Pixel phones, converted my GF into using Pixel (from iPhone), I have the Pixelbook, and every room has a Google Home or Mini. I even paid to be a Stadia Founder. My GF and I bought a house together and decided to furnish it together as well. She bought over $4,000 worth of furniture, and I sent her something like $2280.58 via Google Pay. She wasn't able to claim the money. We spent hours talking to customer support and each time they swore they would fix it \"in 24 hours.\" Finally, we decided to try and send the money back to me, and now I'm not able to re-claim the money I sent to her! We both get a message saying that fraudulent activity has been detected, but each time we call customer support, they swear it'll get resolved (\"in 24 hours\").\n\nI've lost count of how many times I've called customer support only to repeat the same thing over again and have them swear it'll get fixed. This nightmare started September 28 and it's now October 11. I'm wondering if going to a lawyer might be the only way to get it back by getting their attention, but I know they can afford a team of the best lawyers and I'm lucky if I can even get someone that knows corporate law.\n\nHas anyone had similar problems?

Like plugging the drive into a sandboxed machine with the date set back?\n\nMy team's archives are valuable to us and represent years of work, but are only a small fraction of what the rest of the company has lost.",
    "postTitle": "Our company was hit by a ransomware attack. They didn't pay. Vast swaths of critial data are gone, we're rebuilding from paper copies of things.

      "I would not admit to it if I were you. Taking company data home is certainly against policy for very good reasons and I would be highly surprised if you did NOT get fired. I also would not be surprised if they tried to pin the blame of the attack on you, saying that your external hard drive from home introduced the ransomware into their network.",
      "My suggestion is don't say anything. You said that it's only a small fraction of what the rest of the company has lost, so everyone is probably on damage control. Your small backup will not be a deciding factor if it saves or cripples the company. If it was critical data then that would be something different. The only people that care about your data is your team, and that may not save you from losing your job. \n\nPlus you never know if people may start blaming you for the ransomware attack. Saying you are bringing in external devices that you are connecting to the network. So I would also quit doing your backup too. If you present that you have been doing backups and then people find out, everyone will start secretly backing up stuff. If not done correctly could lead to more problems.\n\nI feel sorry for your IT team. I have been there during critical recovery and it sucks. Hopefully, they learn to get backups often and some offsite. \n\nIf what you have won't save the company then it probably won't save your ass either.",
      "No one here can tell you if you will get in trouble for sure, but I'd put money on you would.\n\nFor number 2, that's highly unlikely to work if already infected. They typically reach out to C&C servers which would give them the current time, assuming it's even using time as a trigger. You could put it on a machine that you don't care if you have to reformat and see if it's infected. ",
      "Is no one really going to ask what he was doing taking backups, without consent, then taking them home? Very weird.\n",
      "1. This is a slippery slope if it's against policy. Do you have any devices that weren't hit that you can copy the data to that you can have a 'eureka!' moment and remember you made a backup to test that your backups were working and then restore the files from there (assuming doing backups wouldn't be out of the norm for you for the job you're in anyway)?\n2. If the drive wasn't plugged in at the time of the attack odds are it's going to be fine and the data should be usable.",

Try loading it on a computer that is separate from the network but still has internet access. See if it falls victim to the malware on it's own. Also might want to run some deep scans on it. I'd recommend Vipre. It's the business i work for uses and also what we use on our clients computers as well as reccomend to household customers. You can get a trail and use the deep scan feature.",

Did they do this ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they acted complicit in the action then they cannot blame anyone but themselves.",
      "The first thing this industry taught me was to cover my own ass whenever possible. Now I don\u2019t mean lie, when you mess up, own it without throwing someone else under the bus. But it doesn\u2019t sound like this breach/loss of data is your fault. 100% under no circumstances should you disclose this, not to a boss, friendly co-worker or head of company. They will blame you for the company data loss. They will fire you. Right now they are out for blood and I think everyone here knows this. It\u2019s in your best interest, legally to not disclose this. Now you could use the data you have as a \u201ctemplate\u201d to recover your teams info but that could still be tricky. I\u2019d connect it up at home in a vm and see what is worth recreating (documents etc). Obviously don\u2019t copy it 100%. If there is any software I\u2019d also maybe just download a portion of it that \u201cyou remembered.\u201d \n\nDo not speak to anyone on your team. Your direct boss and everyone under him as well as you are under a huge amount of stress. Everyone is looking for a scapegoat to save their own asses. You stand to gain nothing and loose everything and more if you disclose this. Do you want a visit from the FBI? There are no hero\u2019s here (except if you find a good backup of ALL data) only scapegoats. I\u2019ve seen it happen to co-workers of mine, I\u2019ve seen it happen to a family member that also works in IT. You will 100% be fired and possibly blamed for this. It\u2019s shitty either way you look at it but at least you won\u2019t get fired over taking company data home or possible jail/sued. You and your whole team could still face disciplinary action from your company and you may still end up having to look for a job (seen it happen) but at least once you pick up your last paycheck that\u2019s it-no court, no jail. \n\nI saw something similar happen when I started in IT. We (outsourced IT) had a power user who against our advice assigned everyone domain admin rights to every user that got a new computer. The inevitable happened a couple of months later and we had to wipe 30+ machines and reload all the software. They didn\u2019t loose much data but did have a ton of downtime. We even sent them documentation proving what we recommended and that it wasn\u2019t followed and they still tried to get money from us (think in the end we ended up writing off 70+hours). I think time and effort would be better spent discussing how to prevent this, researching best practices or a weekly lunch and learn with the employees about what not to click on and stuff. There are services you can sign up for that can send dummy emails out to your company and report back who clicks on what so you can re-educate specific user-this 100% needs to happen. I guarantee that your company is not happy with you or anyone on your team at this time and are looking for scapegoats. Do not disclose this information. And do not take backups home. Extra backups are a great idea but leave them in the server room next time.\n\nFinal edit: I\u2019d delete this post. It\u2019s too specific, if you\u2019re on reddit I\u2019d bet money that your fellow team members are. "

      "This reminds me of two situations that would seem benign but were incredibly frustrating...\n\nSituation 1: The first week of my first permanent job in I.T. after obtaining my A+ cert, my coworkers decided to flip my screen. I forget the key sequence, but it might be shift+alt+arrow key. Long story short, it took me a good 10 mins to fix it, and it required me to turn my monitor on its side so I could make sense of my google searches. Fun times. SN: My favorite prank to pull on ppl was to change the target of their shortcuts if they left their computer unlocked. \u201cI\u2019m clicking Chrome, but Solitaire keeps opening.\u201d\n\nSituation 2: I don\u2019t even know if I ever fixed this, but I had a problem with a Lenovo laptop where periodically the shift key would stop working. No idea why, and only when it was hooked to my docking station. Only way to resolve it was to restart the computer. VERY annoying.\n\nI say that to say, I feel your pain. Good luck.",

I\u2019m no \u201cgamer\u201d but I\u2019ve owned several playstations and Xbox\u2019s over the years and play mostly offline; Skyrim, fallout, red dead redemption 2, etc. My 9yo enjoys the video games much more than I do these days and that brings us up to the hack. \n\nThe hacker wanted my PlayStation network game tag. A quaint 4 letter tag that would only be available if you\u2019re old enough to have generated it many years ago on ps2. Apparently I blew him off when he tried to contact me, I say \u201chim\u201d but who knows, so now he has hacked and stolen the psn online name. Ok whatever, but he got ahold of a gmail and yahoo email in the process. \n\nHaving those emails he was able harass me by changing passwords and settings on Netflix, Spotify etc. He gained no access to any financial info that I\u2019ve found and he says he has no interest in that, oh yeah, we chat often. He messages me to see if I\u2019ve changed my mind about paying his bitcoin ransom for the emails. \n\nSo I\u2019ve contacted all the credit cards and banks. Which, btw, I\u2019ve found the best way to get ahold of a person at financial institutions is allowing a payment to go delinquent and at that point a real live person will call you! In any case, most all the changing passwords and securing accounts was time consuming but not difficult. That brings us to PlayStation network (Sony) and xboxlive (Microsoft). \n\nBetween to two platforms I have downloaded content that I value over $2000. Games, movies, subscriptions etc. not including the cost of the systems themselves. All of which I am locked out of because the stolen email addresses are listed as contact and I can\u2019t change passwords without PlayStation and Xbox sending the \u201cchange password\u201d link to the guy who stole all my shit in the first place. \n\nAll attempts to contact customer support at any of the involved companies(Microsoft, Sony, google, yahoo) is an utter disaster. Although yahoo did offer their account recovery tools for $9.99, which is the closest thing to \u201ccustomer support\u201d I\u2019ve obtained from any of these modern marvels of the tech industry. \n\nI\u2019m frustrated beyond the limits of my vocabulary and my 9yo is heartbroken. We were starting Halo 2 together and of course he doesn\u2019t understand that we can\u2019t play now because some neckbeard in his moms basement is having a laugh with our accounts. \n\nI\u2019m not mad at the hacker, more annoyed, people like these don\u2019t deserve the energy that anger requires. But I am absolutely infuriated by the disrespect with witch I\u2019m treated by these companies that have pushed them selves into our daily lives. They promise security, they promise ease of use, they promise that they care for the people who purchase and use their products and they fulfill none of those promises. \n\nI won\u2019t ramble any further. It seems at this point there\u2019s not much left to do but write off the lose, learn the lesson and drive on. \n",

Also this gives you legal foothold in case this dude starts stealing money and credit from you and you it becomes a legal issue.\n\nThe most important thing is to NOT freak out. This shit happens but fortunately hackers get bored easily, fast. Whoever this person is will move on eventually, it's your job now to watch your accounts and your footprint for awhile. You maybe should contact the police and share the logs to them from your accounts which will have IP addresses and so forth. Don't get excited now, these are 99% NOT the actual attackers location but it gives you and the police an excuse to open a case against said anonymous individual so when and if ever the time comes that this person slips up, you have legal support. ALSO contact Sony and let them know what's going on, especially if you make a case with the police. They will HAVE to do something which in turn could mean turning over access logs to the cops from the person now using the PSN account which might actually hold some good info cause gaming over a good cloaked VPN forever is not usually viable. This person will HAVE to access it from a weakpoint if they want decent connection, unless they're just assholes stealing your name and squatting on it for money...\n\nStay strong dude and thank you for being a Fire Fighter!

Then in turn use them to contact Sony and Microsoft legally to get information about the stolen accounts. At worst, they might freeze the accounts under legal investigation.

      "First thing to do is to set yourself up with a new email address with a strong unique password, randomized security questions (so not the real answers). I'd recommend paying for it with actual money so you get support. I like Fastmail but there are others. Do it from a friend's house and on their machine.\n\nContact your cell service provider and update your email, change your password, change your secret question answers if you can. Alert them that you have are a victim of identity theft and to enable whatever security options or locks are available.\n\nSame for your landline telephone provider, if you have one.\n\nThe reasons for this are phone numbers, cell especially, can be used for two factor authentication. (\"something you know\" - **Password**, and \"something you have\" - **Cell Phone**. Another factor that's not relevant in this case is \"something you are\" - **Biometrics like fingerprints**)\n\nDon't regain access to your accounts and lock them down with 2FA (two factor authentication), only for the scumbag to hijack your cell service by ordering a new SIM card or setting up a phone divert or something.\n\nContact the police or FBI or whoever. This is a crime, the person you're dealing with is a criminal. They know who are you, they know where you and your child live, they know who your friends are. \n\nDon't assume this is some neckbeard in his mom's basement. That's a woefully naive look at someone who appears to be a significant adversary.\n\nIn the immediate term, write your passwords (which should be unique and secure) on paper. Once you know your devices haven't been compromised and you have a secure email address (like Fastmail), you can look at using a password wallet like Lastpass or Dashlane etc. \n\nIf you have a Facebook account, warn your friends, and lock it down. If you don't have a Facebook account, have one of your friends check to make sure this asshole hasn't set one up as you.\n\nCheck with credit reference agencies too, and let them know, if you've not done so already. I'm assuming you're American, and I'm pretty sure there's something like a \"freeze\" you can do on them to prevent services being taken out in your name without having it removed first.\n\nI'd also be tempted to have someone who knows what they're doing take a look at your machines and home network. Laptops, desktops, smartphones etc. I'd err on the side of paranoia at this point.\n\nOnce you've done that, you can look at regaining access and resetting your access to your older email accounts. This may prove easier when you have crime reference numbers or whatever from law enforcement. Worst case, you can try having a lawyer draft a letter to send to their legal department. The latter I've no experience with.\n\n---\n^^Edit: ^^accounts~~,~~ *^^and* ^^lock",

    "post": "So I'm in an online college course and I got a weird, vague email from the professor a few days ago claiming that I plagiarized. She threatened to report me to the dean of academics at my university (I'm taking the online class through the school I attend full-time). When I asked her what she was talking about she told me that I had uploaded another student's assignment with her name on it.\n\nThat was true, but it was an honest mistake on my part. The reason I even had another student's assignment on my hard drive was because we were supposed to upload our assignments to a forum, and the submission instructions included the sentence \"Post your assignment here so everyone can view your ideas\". The assignment was confusing, so I downloaded a PDF another girl in my class had already posted. Looking at her assignment helped me get started, and after I finished my assignment and exported it as a PDF I went to upload it to the forum. The girl's PDF had a similar name to mine so I accidentally uploaded hers instead of mine and here's where the shit show begins.\n\nI sent an email to the professor apologizing and explaining that it was an honest mistake. I sent her my PDF that I had intended to turn in, provided a screenshot of the file's metadata showing that it had last been modified before the assignment's deadline, and even told her how to view the metadata for herself if she didn't believe me. Then she sent me another email telling me I'd still receive a zero on the assignment because I \"crossed a line\" by downloading another student's assignment and \"using it as a model\" for my own. Pissed, I emailed her back telling her (politely) that the submission directions literally told us to do exactly what she just described, and I quoted the exact sentence that encouraged us to do that verbatim. I sent the email and began texting a friend to tell them what happened, but when I looked back at the submission page for that specific assignment, the sentence I'd quoted was removed from the page completely. This was not even 10 minutes after I sent the email.\n\nAnyway, I'm guessing she deleted the sentence so that she could deny the fact that it was ever included in the directions. I'm hoping I can somehow roll the site back at least a few hours so I can prove that she deleted it (rolling it back to yesterday or something would work too). I already checked, and the site was never archived on Wayback Machine. The forum in question is on my school's Moodle page, if that helps\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** professor accused me of plagiarism, I called bullshit, emailed her and quoted a sentence that was very important to my case from the course's website, she deleted it within a few minutes after I sent the email. Need to know if there's a way to look at previous versions of the site (other than Wayback Machine) or a recent archive of some sort\n\nUPDATE: Thankfully the professor told me that she deleted the sentence to prevent further confusion and assured me that she wasn\u2019t trying to hide something. Thanks for the help yall. \n\n**IF YOU WANT A MUCH LONGER, FULL VERSION OF THE STORY...** check my profile! I explained it all in much more detail on r/TIFU",

    "post": "  \n\nLate last year I noticed strange things happening on my computer, like browser tabs moving without my input and songs playing by themselves on iTunes, the mouse cursor would move by itself too. Then on my Android phone icons would move around by themselves, i'd also be browsing Reddit and the page would scroll down by itself when I was reading a post.\n\nOne time I got home and a video of a boxer training starting playing by itself on my Android phone when I got to my front door (and could reach wi-fi.) I'd have to open 2 folders on my Android phone to reach the video, then i'd have to play it. I remember I used the phone 30 minutes previous in town using the calculator to add up the price of my grocery bill, then I turned off the display. I did not go at the phone on the bus yet multiple folders were opened on the phone and a video started playing without my input. I remember one time talking to my cousin and I heard the sounds of phone numbers being pressed and a man mumbling in an odd fashion, neither me or my cousin didn't make that noise, I feel like we were being listened in.\n\n   \n \n\nI ended up getting rid of the computer because one day I opened up Firefox and saw \"4chan\" on the bottom left of the screen very briefly, like when you visit a website and the address pops up when you are connecting to that website. I looked at my hard drives under \"This PC\" and saw that my \"D\" drive, which previously had no files on it, had 6.3GB of data on it all of a sudden despite me downloading nothing to that drive. I felt like this person could have downloaded anything to my PC, like child porn for instance but because he had root access to my computer it would look the exact same to the authorities as me downloading it. I could get end up getting arrested over this stuff, I wouldn't be able to prove to the police that a hacker had done it. \n\nI ended up getting rid of the PC, the internet and the Android phone. I got a basic phone which has no internet since I thought i'd be less likely to be hacked. It is an Alcatel phone, but over the past months i've had \"Notification: Unknown Application\" appear on the screen of this basic phone, despite me having no access to the internet and the phone not having an App store. I also hear this clicking sound when I lock and unlock the phone despite me finding no option for enabling or disabling this sound in Settings. Draft messages get deleted at random too.\n\n   \n I communicate with my cousin often and I feel like the hacker was able to send malware to his smartphone from mine, and when my cousin and & I sent texts to each other the hacker could somehow get access to my Alcatel phone (SOMEHOW) despite me having no internet and the phone not being a smartphone. \n\nI was thinking of getting the internet back on at home, getting a laptop and then formatting the hard drive whenever I notice suspicious activity but I read that malware can be installed on a router and you'd have to replace the route to get rid of the malware. Or what if my cousin visited and he connected to my wi-fi, the malware from his phone could infect my router. I am thinking of going to the Police since this person hacking my computer and phone is a crime but I read that hackers are practically invisible so I feel like this would be a waste, I feel like i'm being held hostage.",

When I first got my phone my battery was dying super fast but its fine now.... My mom said some stuff today that made me super suspicious that she can see what I'm texting to people. Is this a spy app or something how can I check?\n\nEdit: (rewrote this whole thing on my computer, was on phone before and awful)\n\nSummary of this I've been depressed for a long time it has recently gotten worse because I broke up with my gf a few months ago and my dad was recently diagnosed with leukemia and is going to die soon. Mom asked me why I didn't have anyone to go out with this weekend (I had been dating a girl and going out with her on weekends but she ghosted me all of a sudden) and then when I told my mom that I didn't have anyone to go out with she said something like \"oh are you guilting her into hanging out with you by saying your going to kill yourself\" Which is obviously a super weird thing to say without knowing anything. No I don't guilt people or force them to do anything by threatening suicide..But I had been talking to people about my feelings and suicide so maybe that's why mom would have brought it up if she had been seeing my texts. Thanks to the people who reached out and talked to me but I really do have people I can talk to already.  I'm really never going to kill myself unless some really bad stuff happens to me all at once; for now I want to live long enough to see sum aliens LMAO(really though I know I will be happy one day, I want to have a family and a beautiful wife one day). I would also like to defend my mom I guess I made her out to be a crazy lady but she is my best friend and favorite person in the world and I kind of doubt she would be spying on me in the first place although she is a very nosy person...I think its possible that she just knows so much about me, she is my mom after all, that she could just tell I have been depressed since she knows I have a lot going on and was just worried about me.

      "From what I've read so far, you want to first make sure that she's spying on you, right? Then lay the bait, and wait. Say something really urgent and scary to some random friend, and see if she reacts. If she does, you know it's her.

Even when it was first bought?\n\n2: If not, then it is very unlikely she would have been able to unless it was delivered as a sort of \"malware\" tied with another app.\n\nNow, you could always test it by sending horrible things to get her attention. Ideas:\n\n1: Text someone to hang out and do something she would not approve of, then tell her you're going to hang out with said person and do something normal\n\n2: Text that you're hiding (illicit item of your choice) at a certain location in your room and then keep an eye on that to see if your mom has tampered with it",
      "Hey I'm pretty late to the party, but keep in mind that a factory reset will remove the app, but if you automatically restore previous apps, it may install again. \n\nAdditionally if anyone knows your Google account credentials, they may be able to remotely install apps from a different device by signing into your account. \n\nTo mitigate this risk: \n1. Log into your Google account from a web browser and set up MFA (text, authenticator etc).\n2.

There's a lot of other people that have gone through similar experiences. Its human nature and nothing to be ashamed of, even if it makes some people uncomfortable and if they don't seem to talk about it themselves. \n\nIt may seem like seeking help from someone that expresses interest in you is the most comfortable or accessible for you, but an even better option is making an appointment with a therapist. Therapists interactions are generally confidential, and they help people through depression all the time. In general they can just help people transition through different phases of their lives. Their job is literally to hear you vent, but also to listen and provide helpful feedback.

Human beings increase their chances for survival (not to mention their levels of serotonin and dopamine) by fighting together. My dad and I never got along until my mom got diagnosed with breast cancer. One day the dam just broke and we were both crying, talking about the same fears. After that conversation, we knew we both had an ally in each other. It was an amazing relief to be able to voice the fears I had. If you feel you can\u2019t do this with your mom, I am 100% available to talk. You are not alone, and it\u2019s ok to need help."

    "post": "I work at a business that is located in a strip mall and over the last few years, I've noticed that there is an insane amount of wireless networks all with excellent signal strength, usually between -40 to -55dBm.  What got me suspicious is that these wireless networks are almost all clones of customers and staff WiFi SSID's, including mine and even friends and family who have come into my place of work.  I felt something was amiss but I didn't feel confident in trying to solve it, so I just never really looked into it any further.  However, I had an itch to check it out again recently and used a WiFi analyzer on my phone to see if I could discover anything and I'm fairly certain that what's going on is a honeypot operation.\n\nViewing the analyzer, all the rogue networks have the same MAC address and interestingly, one of the SSID's is called \"Pineapple\\_XXX\" with the X's representing the 6th octet of the MAC address all the rogue networks have (Note: It's not actually XXX, but I'm just currently paranoid so I didn't want to put the actual octet).  I decided to look up what a pineapple was and it turns out, it's a pentest tool used to test network vulnerabilities.  The company that makes them is called Hak5 and upon reviewing their devices, it seems it's a pretty popular and relatively easy to use tool to exploit networks.\n\nAgainst my better judgement, I attempted to sign into one of the networks and was greeted with a Facebook login I needed to do before getting access to the network.  I don't have Facebook and even if I did, I wouldn't put my actual credentials in, so I just put in some random bullshit and surprise surprise, it gave me access to the network.  I then went to google to check my public facing IP and it was different than the IP I recorded when I was my work WiFi.  I should note that I shut off mobile data for this to make sure it wasn't just pulling my mobile IP but for the sake of transparency, I checked my mobile IP several different times and it always had the same network part, different than the IP I pulled from the rogue network.  Upon looking up the IP address, I find out the provider is AT&T (SBC) which is not the provider my work has (we have Comcast Business).  Tonight, I had time to get a good look around to see if there were any devices I could spot that might be the source, even took a good look up in the ceiling panels to make sure there were no devices up there, but I couldn't find anything.  I'm of course assuming this thing is plugged in for how long it's been operating.\n\nI obviously can't confirm this is a honeypot, but I feel all the indicators are there.  I did some signal strength testing and it gets stronger the closer I get to the wall of the adjacent business.  One final thought; there was a network that showed up and continues to show up called \"kali\" and upon looking that up, it turns out it's a Linux distro specifically designed for pentesting.  This can't all just be some big coincidence, can it?\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone.  It seems the most common advice is to contact the building owner/managment along with different law enforcement agencies.  I'll see where that takes this.  Thanks again!",

      "[This](https://shop.hak5.org/products/wifi-pineapple) is a pineapple, it is a purpose-built rogue access point for security testing and it's definitely an attempt to steal credentials with the facebook captive portal. It could be a jealous ex, a criminal hacker looking for financial gain, a corporate security audit, or something else along those lines. \n\nYou should report it to the mall's security if you haven't already. Pineapples are relatively low-power devices and are easy to camoflage in a plastic shell with a large battery. It could be just about anywhere, but HAM clubs usually *love* the opportunity to chase down a wifi signal. The other suggestions about police, FCC, and AT&T's abuse deparment might be worth pursuing, but someone with the right RF equipment will let you quickly confiscate the device and resolve the situation while you work with the authorities. If you do find the device and if you think the police will treat it seriously as a criminal investigation, you might need to worry about evidence and chain of custody. \n\nThe basic guidelines would be to wear gloves and minimize contact with it so you don't smudge any existing fingerprints. If it's battery powered, place it in a box lined with aluminum foil or a metal trashcan so the attacker can't remotely disable/wipe it and keep it somewhere secure until it can be turned in to the police. If it's plugged in it might be a little harder to surround it in metal and improvize a farady cage, but it's the same idea.",
      "Dont report to local authorities report it to FCC they will take it seriously",
      "I would say start with the mgr of your store, mgr of other stores that this device is impersonating.   Make sure they understand the importance of what's going on, ie xSomeonex is using their brand name and harvesting credentials.  You can possibly report to facebook but it might get lost in the shuffle of info.  I'd hope at least 1 of the local stores has a security person that can work the issue, find the physical device and confiscate it.\n\nPerhaps ask over in the monthly Q & A on r/netsec [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/cy5q9v/the_rnetsec_monthly_discussion_thread_september/)",
      "This absolutely sounds like a spoofing/honeypot/credential scraping situation. As others stated, pineapples are a really common spoofing tool used both legitimately and illegitimately to spoof SSIDs and act as rogue access points.\n\nYou have a few real options. If you live in a relatively urban area, local police may have people who can help out and will take this seriously. I say this because most rural police have no knowledge of cybercrimes or the like, and certainly down have any measures against cybercrimes. But if you're in a more populated area, they very well may be able to help. \n\nOtherwise, reach out to FCC as others stated - they also may be able to help.\n\nAlternatively, and I don't really recommend this unless you know how to be inconspicuous and understand you should not approach the origin without proper support (security/police), you could use a wifi analyzer to see if you can triangulate the origin of the broadcasts. If you're in a strip mall, it is likely coming from a neighboring store with a 'malicious' employee if you see it frequently (meaning every day). If it comes and goes, you likely have someone who pops into the mall to scrape creds with a hackpack whenever they feel like it.\n\nI would also advise informing your manager or building ownership. They should take this very seriously, and if they don't, you should explain to them WHY it is serious.\n\nMy personal course of action would be to inform building ownership of your findings, explain to them what it means if they don't understand, and make a call to authorities WITH them.

      "I know a bit about this as I used to mess with people (usually in shops or public places) this way. Here's what probably happened.\n\n1. Your camera is set up to be accessible from an external IP address. Anyone who knows your IP address can try to access your camera.\n2. Your camera got indexed on a search engine like [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/). People can use Shodan to find specific types of devices such as your camera, which has a remotely controllable speaker.\n3. Your password wasn't changed from the default, or was insecure enough to be easily guessable. Most cheap cameras have no password, or have `123456` or `admin` as the password, which makes them incredibly easy to \"hack\".\n4. Someone found your camera on a search engine, guessed (or bruteforced) the password, and gained full control of your camera.\n5. They decided to play a sound effect down your camera to scare you, which was clearly successful.\n\nSomeone with a bit of patience and technical knowledge could easily do this to you. Your first port of call needs to be **changing the password** on your camera to something **secure**. This should keep out anyone looking for a cheap laugh at your expense. Do the same to any other devices you have.\n\nYou shouldn't be too worried about this, as it's almost certainly not an attack targeted at you personally. If you still get people doing this to you after changing your password, you probably have a camera vulnerable to an issue where your passwords could be disclosed, at which point you should consider buying a different camera from a reputable manufacturer.",

Doesn't seem to harm my computer from what I've seen, but is this maybe indicative of a bigger problem or something? Please help I know this sounds stupid but it's driving me crazy.

We are very causal with our internet use, causal gaming and using our laptops and junk. Our 4th roomate is an avid PC gamer, spent several thousand dollars on equipment and what not, and he is able get speeds of 800mbs per second download on his PC and on his IPhone. I\u2019m concerned because none of us in the house are able to obtain these speeds. He bought a Net-gear Nighthawk and set it up himself, is it possible he prioritized all of his devices leaving us shit speeds? \n\nHope this makes sense, my tech knowledge is very surface level.\n\nUPDATE: First of all thank you for all the help, this has been a real frustrating situation.\n\nRoomate did a hard reset on the router and then ran a speed test on his phone that was getting roughly 15mbps and it shot up to 130mbps. He has an older iPhone 6s, don\u2019t know how much that would effect signal strength, but still a massive improvement. What does this mean in our situation? Can we confirm we has throttling our internet for his use?\n\nUPDATE #2: After the hard reset of the router the hardwired PS4 speeds went from 60mbps to 230mbps.",

      "Absolutely. I have done this to a roommates torrent traffic, specifically. \n\nHe probably followed this guide\nhttps://kb.netgear.com/24266/How-to-enable-Quality-of-Service-QoS-on-routers-using-the-NETGEAR-web-interface",
      "Yes, it's possible to limit speeds to specific devices on the router. Also, make sure you're not comparing Megabyte (MB) and Megabits (Mb)",
      "Reset the router to default settings when he's not home.  Then try it again.  If you get better speeds it must have been a setting he changed.\n\nIf you wanna be sneaky about it, just say everyone couldn't sign in and you needed internet, so you figured it be easy to re-setup again later.  \n\nAt first I was thinking maybe he was on 5gz and you all were on 2.4, but then you said even hardwired, so I'm leaning towards him being a dick.  \n\nI would make him pay you all for months that he had this setting. If he gets 90% bandwidth then he's responsible for 90% of the bill. If he wants to keep it that way then he'll be paying for it (which I'd take if I were you, 80mb is pretty fast anyway).\n\nRegardless, please let us know how this plays out.",
      "You sure you have your speeds right? You basically are saying that you are all getting 640mbps, but your roommate is getting 800mbps\n\nThis seems pretty normal, depending on the situation. It also very much depends on how you are measuring speeds. What servers are you using to measure? What service?",
      "I can almost guarantee you he is. It's very easy to throttle devices through a router.",
      "It's definitely within possibility that he throttled your speeds. So if you run something like [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/) do you consistently get lower speeds or is it only at certain times of the day, or during high traffic times? Also, 80MB/s = 640Mb/s, don't confuse megabits and megabytes, (1 byte = 8 bits). You're still not getting your full bandwidth anyway but just thought I'd make sure you're aware of that. \n\nAnyway, I'd ask him about it. I wouldn't go behind his back or anything and login to the router and adjust settings, but definitely ask him to reset it, if he is unwilling, you have your answer.",
      "\\> He bought a Net-gear Nighthawk and set it up himself, is it possible he prioritized all of his devices leaving us shit speeds?\n\nYes.  He is throttling your devices, and that's an asshole thing to do.  I immediately do not trust him.\n\nYour whole house depends on his Netgear, so you should all have its username / password.  If he refuses to share the password, it's because he's a liar and a thief.  You and your roommates can share money and buy another router, and he will probably start a fight over it, because he wants to be in control.",
      "The nighthawk can allocate bandwidth accordingly. Just allocate your devices equally. Problem solved. You all pay the same. Take your chunk of the pie. Btw gaming does not require a lot of bandwidth. Very little actually. Gaming is about latency not downstream.\n\nAnd it's Mbps not MB/s. Totally different speed measurements. Make sure if you're using WiFi that the 5ghz channel has a different SSID from the 2.4ghz channel as well.\n\nIt's very easy to login to the router settings to check bandwidth allocation.\n\nHandle it with care. There's no reason to get heated. It's internet, not the end of the world. He probably has prioritization setup. Let him know the problems  y'all are experiencing and ask him to make sure all devices have equal prioritization in the router settings.\n\nHere's a vid of what the settings look like on the router: https://youtu.be/DzPWRTMgZM0",
      "i'm going to make an assumption that doesn't add anything to the thread.\n\nthat guy is an asshole",
      "Here is a thought, and the first thing I would check given the information you have provided.. if everyone is getting 80, and 1 person is getting 800, you might be using Cat5 cable, limited to 100Mbps.. Cat5e (different than Cat5) will get up to 1000.  So check your cables for markings... or put your cable on his gaming PC and then run a speed test.. \nsee if he still gets 800 or if he gets under 100."

The video continued to play for a few minutes, but eventually stopped. The \"searching\" has not stopped. I've turned it off and on, restarted the modem/router, and looked through the TV's settings trying to find a way to turn off automatic updates to no avail. \n\nI'm at a loss here, and my TV is now completely worthless whenever it's connected to the internet. The searching constantly interrupts everything that I'm doing, even just going into the menu.

Once your television begins the WPS connection process, cancel out of it. This disconnects you from the network. Now reconnect to your network of choice (you will have to retype your password). This should stop the searching. It worked for me and many others.\n\nFor those using wired connection: Haven't used this myself, but others have reported success.

Then looked for a jpg with that date modified and found [this.](http://i.imgur.com/A1p9G17.png) I realize now that [this](http://i.imgur.com/ssPO0Wo.png) should have been a tipoff. I deleted the picture, disabled the startup in task manager, and moved the .vbs to my desktop to post it here. That script is below. I'm going to restart my laptop and see what happens. I think it's possible there's something else too.\n\n**Update 2:** Monkeys are back. Found another copy under \"C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.4\\Doc\\EULA.jpg\" instead of \"\\Intel\\download.jpg\". Restarted after deleting and we're good so far. One was in startup and the other in task scheduler. Unless there's something else in that script you guys see, it looks like that's all folks.\n\n    Dim shell : Set shell = CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\")\n    Dim wallpaper : wallpaper = \"C:\\Intel\\download.jpg\"\n    Set oSHApp = CreateObject(\"Shell.Application\")\n    \n    Do While True\n\tshell.RegWrite \"HKCU\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\Wallpaper\", wallpaper\n    \n\twscript.sleep 3000\n\n\tshell.Run \"%SYSTEMROOT%\\System32\\rundll32.exe user32.dll,UpdatePerUserSystemParameters\", 1, True\n\n\twscript.sleep 10000\n    Loop",

I closed the app and saw she had sent me a text. I asked why, and she said she was responding to my text. I absolutely did not text her anything. She has a Samsung S9. Her thread looks like this:\n\n1:28 (from me) Love you...\n\n1:28 (from her) I love you.\n\n1:36 (from me) Lies!\n\nMY thread looks like this (IPhone 8)\n\n1:28 (from her) I love you.\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. I got her message, but someone else very clearly sent her two messages within our text thread. What\u2019s even creepier is that those are definitely things I would say, but there isn\u2019t an instance of me saying exactly that anywhere on my phone. I also wouldn\u2019t use the fragment \u201cLove you...\u201d, as I use full sentences. \n\nTrying to figure out what\u2019s going on, and what to do.

After three unsuccessful warranty repair attempts for an acknowledged factory defect in their display, **Lenovo disposed of my laptop, won't replace it, and will only refund me half of what I paid for it.** \n\nGet a quick overview in this [imgur album](http://imgur.com/gallery/UJfkx) or read on for a lengthy timeline of the whole saga.  With pictures!\n\n**April 30th, 2014** \u2013 I bought a sweet new refurbished[ Lenovo Thinkpad Laptop](http://i.imgur.com/xPnNqGE.jpg) through Amazon.  I love Thinkpads and have been using them since before they were Lenovo.  Hurray!\n\nIt was sold through an Amazon marketplace third party but despite being refurbished, it specifically says it has a full factory warranty.\n\n**July 23rd, 2014** \u2013 My laptop starts having ghosting/image retention issues.  It is a very common issue on the [forums](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-Edge-S-series/Thinkpad-Yoga-ghosting-after-image-watermark-issue/td-p/1412737).   Lenovo has no official solution and mine is still tolerable during every day use, so I wait.\n\n**November 4th, 2014** \u2013 Lenovo officially [acknowledges that there is a defect in their hardware.](http://i.imgur.com/cv6iznl.jpg)  Some users have been reporting that the replacement panel also shows symptoms of ghosting, but Lenovo denies it.\n\n**November 24th, 2014** \u2013 My display has [deteriorated quite a bit](http://i.imgur.com/ncaIKCe.jpg) so I call Lenovo tech support.  They are very friendly and overnight me a box to ship my laptop in to the service depot for a screen replacement.\n\n**December 2nd, 2014** \u2013 I receive my laptop back.  They have replaced the display with the updated panel.  A quick test shows very mild image retention still, but it is much improved.  However, now there are [two dead areas in the touch screen](http://i.imgur.com/BzctX5Q.jpg) that don't respond.  One of them is right over the start button.  Several other people [have this issue in the forums.](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-Edge-S-series/ThinkPad-Yoga-touchscreen-dead-spots-on-lower-corners/m-p/1728329)\n\n**December 3rd, 2014** \u2013 Called back tech support.  They are not quite as together this time but ship me another box to send my laptop in again.   I send it in December 9th.\n\nThis time they hold onto it for a week. The status says \u201cHold for customer information\u201d instead of \u201cRepairing\u201d but support assures me that's just a placeholder and that they don't need more information from me.\n\n**December 17th, 2014** \u2013 I get an email saying the repair was complete and the laptop was shipped back to me.  UPS tracking shows the laptop was delivered to North Carolina somewhere.  I live in California.\n\nHere's what the nice lady on support chat said:\n\n> **Tiffany**  \n> Per David O****** sending machine to lenovo for investigation. SBU  \n> You should recieve a call for a posible replacement.\n> \n> **Me**  \n> do you have a number I should call?\n> \n> **Tiffany**  \n> They will contact you.  \n> Is there anything else I can help you with?\n> \n> **Me**  \n> Will they contact me today do you think?\n> \n> **Tiffany**  \n> maybe not today unsure.  \n> Is there anything else I can help you with?\n> \n> **Me**  \n> So there's no ETA on when the laptop will be repaired or replaced at all?\n>\n> **Tiffany Snadon**  \n> NO  \n> You will be contacted the just recieved the machine it's a process.  \n> Is there anything else I can help you with?\n> \n> **Me**  \n> Okay  \n> That's all, thanks \n\n**December 19th, 2014** - Still haven't heard anything.  I call Lenovo customer service.  Same number I've always used.  The guy says that he doesn't do Thinkpad support, but he'll transfer me.  He transfers me, I wait on hold, another man answers.  He says he's in Ideapad support and doesn't do Thinkpad support.  I tell him I was just transferred here BECAUSE he did Thinkpad support.  He's like nope, let me transfer you back to Thinkpad support.  He hangs up instead of transferring me.\n\nI call Thinkpad support again.  The lady on the phone is baffled and calls the support depot for me.  We wait on hold for about 30 minutes, finally the support depot answers.  The customer support lady hung up at some point during the wait and is no longer on the line.  Whatever.  The support depot says  \"yeah we sent it off to engineering, someone should have contacted you.\"  I was like \"no one contacted me.\"  they were like \"huh!\" then they gave me the number of the guy they sent it to.  I call, but no one answers.  I call back the support depot, wait on hold for 20 more minutes, then explain the situation again.  They use phrases like \u201cthis is so weird\u201d and \u201cI've never seen this before!\u201d  She calls Lenovo HQ for me, and eventually comes back and says that the guy who has my laptop is one of their top engineers but he's out of the office for the day already.  It is...  1:16pm.  They have no idea what he's doing with it or when I will get it back.\n\nRight after I hang up, amusingly, FedEx knocks on my door and delivers my laptop back to me.  I open it up.  It is exactly the same, same screen ghosting, same dead spots in the touch screen, and also now the [covers that hide the screws are missing.](http://i.imgur.com/sUBsOkR.jpg)\n\nI call back Technical support, explain the whole situation.  Since they have tried twice to repair and only made things worse, I ask for a replacement laptop or for a repair tech to come to my location instead of sending it to their depot (a service they offer for more expensive warranties.)  They refuse.  The lady says she will escalate this to their \u201ctop techs\u201d this time.  I explain that it was already sent to their \u201ctop engineer\u201d at Lenovo HQ and still wasn't fixed.  She says she can't do anything except put a note on it for the service depot to escalate it.  I ask why that didn't already happen after they didn't fix it the first time.  She says she's positive they will fix it this time if it is escalated.  I ask what happens if they don't, she says then they would discuss a replacement but she's positive it won't come to that.\n\n**December 23rd, 2014** \u2013 They've had my laptop a few days, the status is back at \u201cHold for customer information.\u201d  I'm also not getting email confirmations this time for some reason.  I call the service depot, wait on hold, and finally ask if they need any more information from me.  They say no.  I ask why I'm not getting emails.  She says that no email address is listed for me, even though they had my email the last two times.  I ask her to add one, she says she can't modify service requests, only view them.  Great.\n\nAt some point after the first failed repair I filled out one of those [\u201cHow are we doing\u201d automated surveys](http://i.imgur.com/u2sETmT.jpg) regarding their customer support, and later that afternoon, a Customer Satisfaction Advocate emails me.  I reply within 20 minutes explaining the whole situation.  She [replies](http://i.imgur.com/SNykhU4.jpg) immediately:\n\n> I am out of the office until 12/24/2014.\n \n> I will respond to your message when I return.\n\nShe never responded.  Hilarious.\n\n**December 29th, 2014** \u2013 I receive a call from a new guy in escalations asking me to call him.  I call him back twice, no answer.\n\n**December 30th, 2014** \u2013 I call him back again.  He asks why I called.  I said...  he left me a message asking me to, and I was just checking on the status of my laptop.  He says he doesn't know but he will contact the service depot.\n\n**January 2nd, 2015** \u2013 Haven't heard anything.  Call back escalation guy.  The second time I call, he answers, says he hasn't heard anything, but he will email the service depot manager.\n\n**January 5th, 2015** \u2013 Haven't heard anything.  Call back the escalation guy.  He says they can't fix my laptop, but someone should contact me about a replacement.\n\n**January 12th, 2015** \u2013 Haven't heard anything.  Get a call from escalations guy.  He asks if I'd been trying to call him, because they changed his number.  He says the service depot has said they can't repair my laptop but they haven't officially marked that down on the service request yet.  Lenovo can't proceed with a replacement until they officially say they cannot repair it.  He says he will email them again.\n\n**January 13th, 2015** \u2013 I miss a call from a new Customer Advocacy Case Manager in the morning.  I call her back and she doesn't answer. Over the next few days, I call several more times.\n\n**January 15th, 2015** \u2013 Finally get a hold of her.  She says because my laptop was purchased through a third party vendor, they can't replace it, but they can refund me what I paid for it.  She has to request a refund, confirm the amount, and then money is coming from China so it will take a couple weeks.  I tell her they've had my laptop for months and ask if there are any other options, she says no.  This is the first I'm hearing about the \"can't replace laptops sold through third parties\" rule.  She says she just needs me to ship my laptop back to them to get the process started.  I tell her that it is... still in the their repair center.  Where it's been for months.  She's like \u201coh good that will speed things up!\u201d\n\n**January 16th, 2015** \u2013 I [emailed the customer advocate lady back](http://i.imgur.com/uzolegt.jpg) (she specifically told me to email her since she was too busy with customers to answer the phone.)  I explained I had been thinking about her refund offer and decided I thought it was unfair.  Even if I got my full purchase price back, because I got a deal on it originally, it wouldn't be enough money to replace it with the exact same model without spending additional money out of pocket.  I requested a replacement of my exact same laptop, if not the newer version that was just announced that would presumably fix this hardware issues.  If that wasn't possible, at least a discount on a new laptop that would bring it down to the $1400 I paid originally, especially considering the length of time this had taken and the fact that it was a known hardware issue in the first place exacerbated by the service department.\n\nShe never replied.  She also never contacted me to confirm anything.\n\n**January 27th, 2015** \u2013 I receive a check from Lenovo for $864.06.  I originally paid $1399.99 for my laptop.  I call back the customer advocate, she doesn't answer.  I call the escalation guy at the depot, he tells me to send him my original receipt and he will forward it along.\n\n**January 28th, 2015** \u2013 The customer advocate rep calls me back.  I recorded it, but in summary she says that they only refund the amount that Lenovo was paid for the laptop, not the amount I paid, and they won't replace the machine because it was refurbished.  Literally she claims if I bought a Lenovo laptop at Best Buy that they couldn't repair they would only refund me what Best Buy paid for it.  \n\nI say I never would have accepted a refund had I known it would be for half of what I paid for it.  She maintains my only option is to go back to the original vendor.  I tell her fine, send me back the laptop so I can return it to Amazon.  She says she will email the service depot to see if they even still have it.\n\nI ask for a discount on a new one, she offers me a 15% discount.  That would make a new laptop of the exact same model cost roughly $1500, which is more than the $1400 I paid originally and much more than the only $860 I have now.\n\nShe tells an unrelated story about a lady in Afghanistan who bought a Lenovo laptop off eBay and received one that had been opened and parts swapped out.  She claims in my case that they can't prove that Lenovo caused the issue, because maybe my seller modified the laptop before I got it.  I say that's ridiculous because it's a known hardware issue in this model and also the *service depot* caused the second issue.  She says she is \"baffled\" that I never got an email about the refund price.\n\nShe claims the seller lied about it coming with a new factory warranty, even though their own refurb factory outlet specifically says all computers come with a full factory warranty.  She promises to send me the warranty information but never does.\n\nShe refuses to believe the service depot made the issue worse after the first repair. Exact quote: \"They're in the service of fixing your computer, why would they break something?\"\n\nAnyway.  I continued our communication with emails, to get things in writing. \n\nYou can read the whole [email chain here](http://i.imgur.com/g6IfBRW.jpg), but some select quotes:\n\n> **Me**  \n> Are you saying if I bought a Lenovo laptop from Best Buy, and it had a hardware defect that couldn't be repaired by the service depot, Lenovo wouldn't replace the machine and would only refund the amount Best Buy originally paid Lenovo for the laptop?\n\n> **Lenovo**  \n>We would only refund you the price Best Buy purchased our machine from us\n\nand\n\n> **Me**  \n>Can you show me these policies somewhere?  Because as I said in my first email the outlet website specifically states the laptops come with a standard warranty and... Doesn't make any mention of only replacing refurbished with refurbished or similar.\n\n> **Lenovo**  \n> These are internal policies.\n\nAnyway, of course the service depot had already scrapped my laptop, so they can't return it, and won't pay me more than $860 for a refund that I never agreed to in the first place.\n\nHer final email:\n\n> As already stated, we will not be giving you any further compensation for your machine that was purchased from a third party vendor.   Buyer beware.\n\n\nTL;DR Buyer beware indeed.\n\n[UPDATE: Lenovo responded to a BBB complaint, should be resolved in another month.](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2vgrf4/update_on_lenovo_customer_support_horror/)",

      "Hello, I worked in the cable industry for about 10 years so hopefully I can help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right in the sense that nothing on your personal home network is likely to be causing any issues.  What he's talking about is ingress on the Coax connection.  This is when unwanted frequencies are getting into the cable line, and causing issues for likely yourself and your neighbors.  This can be due to many, many things.  Anytime a cable, connector or splitter somewhere along the path has been compromised, it can create a situation where the line becomes a sort of open antenna, allowing all of those random frequencies in the air to get into the local network.  Analog TV stations, cell phone signals, radios - ANYTHING that is open air frequency can get in and it jumbles everything up in the closed network - your street.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cable technicians all are equipped with DSAM meters, which do a very good job of helping them track down where ingress is originating from.  It's very likely they traced it back to your residence and are just coming by to do a very common proactive fix.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese practices are actually great for everyone, as anyone whos ever had cable issues before should know - cable is a very fragile system that requires constant maintenance and surveillance to keep you - the customer - from having any issues.  So the fact that they came by shows they are trying to stay ahead of any problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I missed your edits, glad it all worked out.  Hopefully this sheds some light for anyone who was curious how that could be a thing that happens."

Your router at home tries to recieve these ping attemps, but cant keep up. Because of this, it drops all the incoming signals it cant keep up with. Those signals could be other ping attemps, a webpage your trying to visit, or online gameplay data.\n\nIf enough data packets of what youre trying to use get dropped (which, they will) it will cause you to lose connection or have a slow intermittent connection.\n\nTheres nothing you can do to STOP the DDoS attack pinging you, but you can change your external ip address. Call your ISP and request that. Also let them know you think youve been a target of a DDoS attack. \n\nLet them know what i said above if they dont understand.",

      "Make sure your phone is connecting to a 5GHz wifi network. There is 2.4 and 5. 2.4 has wider range but slower speed. 5 has smaller range but high speeds. Also make sure your wifi / phone is not outdated, old devices can clog up the traffic and slow it up. One way to check is to change the wifi password and only connect your phone to the 5 ghz network and see if it made a difference in speed. If it did, then there is a device that is clogging up the traffic. You can start joining other devices with the new password but make sure you check the speed every time. Thats how you can figure it out. Other possible issues are WiFi channels. Wifi operates on certain channels and the more of tour neighbors use the same channel, the more confused the devices get and the more interference there is. For example you can download a wifi analyzer app and see what wifi channels are used for 2.4 and 5. If your wifi is on the channel with most neighbors, i recommend changing it. (For example if your neighbors are all on channel 6 of 2.4 network, change your wifi channel to 1 or 11. You can google why i mentioned 1 and 11). Also one more thing, check the dns settings on your phone, when you connect to wifi and go to advanced settings of that wifi network, it will allow you to change dns. It will probably have your ISPs dns. Try changing it to 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare dns) or 8.8.8.8 (Google Dns) and see if it helps your problem. Also some wifi routers will have something called QoS which might prioritize other devices over your or prioritize other programs over what you are using. On top of that check the router settings to make sure the bandwidth is not being throttled. Sometimes wifi routers have rules that say to reduce the speed for certain ports during certain hours. Good luck my friend and let your download speeds be fast and your ping low.",

In a few words: Format and reinstall.\n\nSince you said you do not know much about computers, what I'd like to focus on is what you should do to not have this happen again. There is one thing that is pretty simple to learn, and that is good browsing habits. Behold the 5 commandments of safe browsing:\n\n-Don't visit random sites or links people tell you to. \n\n-Do not download executables from sites you do not trust. \n\n-Install a Noscript and an Adblock addon for your browser. \n\n-Do not open ANY email attachments from people you do not trust. An excel file for example (who would guess?) can infect your pc through vba macros.\n\n-If you like browsing risky sites do so through a sandbox. Sandboxie is the easiest one to install and use as it does not require much configuration and a google search can get you going.\n\nI am sure there are a couple of things I am not remembering right now, but if you follow those rules you will not get infected again and you don't need to buy fancy antivirus suites. Malwarebytes and windows defender are good enough nowadays. A very thorough firewall which would show you a pop-up anytime ANYTHING tries to access the internet would not go amiss either (I personally use windows 10 firewall control by Sphinxsoft.)

Just remember to give at least 4 hours of drying time (the alcohol should evaporate by then) before adding the battery back and getting the charger. \n\nAt this point, don't try to use anything else to dig at the center hole anymore as may damage the port or push dried mayo even deeper. \n\nDepending on the model of laptop, the DC port may even be modular, meaning that if you remove the bottom of the laptop, you may find that the DC port can be replaced if it connects to motherboard via plug rather than soldered to board. Replacements are as cheap as $15 and with a guide on ifixit.com can be replaced in 15 min or less.",

Nowadays, most electronics use some Lithium polimer and will actually shut down or stop charging when nearing 5% or 95% (even though the display says you reached 0% or 100%) to protect your device. \n\nSome of the devices we designed at work will even continue reading in the diaplay 100% until you go down to around 90% to stop people from wanting to charge again. \n\nBack to your question, keep it charged between 20% and 80% if you really want to maximize your battery life.",
      "With a modern phone you need not worry at all about when to charge you battery. The battery is charging is managed by software which prevents the battery remaining in any state which would reduce it's life. For example it will never actually be a '0%' charge - regardless of what the phone tells you. \n\nFast charging reduces life somewhat, but being able to juice your phone up in minutes is usually worth the trade off. That said it can be worth getting a 'slow' charger for your bedside as charging overnight does not need to be quick.",
      "Modern battery packs have their own little \"computer\" inside them to monitor the charge level and temperature which means they can't be overcharged so leaving them plugged in is fine. The older nickel cadmium batteries were susceptible to \"memory effect\" and modern lithium batteries don't have this issue but are temperature sensitive at the higher ends of hot and cold. Near freezing temperatures will slow or stop current flow and heat will degrade the ability to charge. Most battery studies I've seen say to routinely charge between 40% to 80% with occasional 10% to 100% charge for calibration and to keep the charging process as cool as possible with around 92F to 105F (33C-40C) being the norm.",

There is a component that is failing when the system is powered by battery. This is due to normal wear and tear and is not considered to be a potential safety issue.\n\n We are shipping the system back to you since the warranty on the system does not encourage any repairs unless you pay for the repairs to complete. I will update you once the tracking details are available.\n\n Regards,\n\nSuneel Prasad\n\nDell | Executive Customer Support Team\"\n\n \n   This was the email I had received by the Dell representative Suneel Prasad in an attempt to close the complaint I had opened months ago about my Dell Alienware laptop catching fire.  Only 3 months prior to my Dell laptop catching fire, there had been issues with the computer straight out of the factory.  Dell had my laptop returned to them and fixed the issues, deeming it safe for use.\n  After my laptop had spewed fire out of then back, leaving scorch marks on my desk, I contacted Dell and they simply told me \"If you are out of warranty then we unfortunately cannot do anything for you Sir\", with absolutely no concern for the fire.  I contacted the Better Business Bureau to assist with my case, and so they did.  \n  After the Executive Dell Support team from Austin, Texas had been contacted it took months for the case to go anywhere.  This is mainly because Dell had lied to the BBB and myself, saying that they had already had an examination team examining my laptop and that they had found nothing of harm.  At this point, I had not sent Dell my laptop yet (I have this email documented from Dell).\n   After I had caught them in their lie, Dell immediately sent me a box to return the laptop to them for actual examination.\n   A month after sending them the laptop, Dell responded to me with the email stating that no component they had found was of any harm, and the incident was caused by normal \"wear and tear\".\n  Regardless of what component has failed, and regardless of why it has failed, fire and smoke have came out of the back of the computer.  The inner components of the computer wouldn't be scorched and melted unless they were heated to a temperature where fire was produced.  There is very clear evidence showed in the pictures I had taken of the laptops inner components.  It has become a regular occurrence for Dell to now tell me that my case is harmless.  I realize now that Dell deems fire coming out of the back of their computers as long as it was produced from \"wear and tear\" as a non-safety hazard.  From how this has been handled so far, one could think that \"wear and tear\" is expected to cause a Dell system to set fire, and that there is no surprise to my case.  Regardless of whether or not Dell thinks the situation was harmless, it very well was not harmless, as documented by the local PC repair shop I had taken the system to (I also have a picture of their formal report from the laptops attempted repairs).  It is clear to me that Dell's support team would rather every other option then customer satisfaction and product safety.  \n    If I was not standing next to the computer when it caught fire to unplug it from the wall to disconnect power, it could have potentially burned my house down.\n\nNot only do I have a video that shows what happens when I plug the battery into the computer, but I also have pictures of the scorched components and of the formal document given to me from the local PC repair shop.\n\n\n***EDIT MUST READ***: Earlier today after I emailed the Dell CEO I received a call from Suneel Prasad.  He told me their stance remains the same, and that the situation has already been escalated to its fullest.  I don't think they like all this bad publicity, what do you guys think?  Lets keep pushing the right buttons and see what kind of reaction we can get out of them next.\n\n\nSO, can you guys help me get some publicity?\n\nPictures of Components:\n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/l1p7KMc.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bzgIc6t.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lepaV9x.jpg\n\nPictures of the Computer Itself:\nhttp://imgur.com/iBGrFQ8,O7QLJkh,fp5npuD,HW4DEVU,yo4vWOj,oHWw3Mt#0\nhttp://imgur.com/iBGrFQ8,O7QLJkh,fp5npuD,HW4DEVU,yo4vWOj,oHWw3Mt#1\nhttp://imgur.com/iBGrFQ8,O7QLJkh,fp5npuD,HW4DEVU,yo4vWOj,oHWw3Mt#2\nhttp://imgur.com/iBGrFQ8,O7QLJkh,fp5npuD,HW4DEVU,yo4vWOj,oHWw3Mt#3\nhttp://imgur.com/iBGrFQ8,O7QLJkh,fp5npuD,HW4DEVU,yo4vWOj,oHWw3Mt#4\nhttp://imgur.com/iBGrFQ8,O7QLJkh,fp5npuD,HW4DEVU,yo4vWOj,oHWw3Mt#5\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***WATCH THE VIDEO ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE***\nhttps://www.facebook.com/alienwarelaptopfire?skip_nax_wizard=true&ref_type=bookmark\n\n\n***ALSO VIEW EMAILS OF DELL LYING AND REPORTING THE CASE TO BE HARMLESS ON FACEBOOK PAGE***\n",

Unfortunately it seems these companies have no problem selling expensive gaming laptops but refuse to actually support them or even admit that they are dangerous due to them generally using power adapters that can barely meet demand and thermal designs that aren't up to spec.

In decimal notation, one megabyte (MB) is equal to 1,000,000 bytes, one gigabyte (GB) is equal to 1,000,000,000 bytes, and one terabyte (TB) is equal to 1,000,000,000,000 bytes.\n\nPrograms such as FDISK, system BIOS, Windows, and older versions of\u00a0macOS use the binary (base 2) numbering system. In the binary numbering system, one megabyte is equal to 1,048,576 bytes, one gigabyte is equal to 1,073,741,824 bytes, and one terabyte is equal to 1,099,511,627,776 bytes.\n\n**Simply put, decimal and binary translates to the same amount of storage capacity.** Let's say you wanted to measure the distance from point A to point B. The distance from A to B is 1 kilometer or .621 miles. It is the same distance, but it is reported differently due to the measurement.",
      "You buy 4000000000000 bytes of data (\\~4GB)\n\nbut 1KB = 1024 byte, 1MB = 1024KB, 1GB = 1024MB, 1TB = 1024GB\n\nso 4000000000000 / 1024 = 3906250000\n\n3906250000 / 1024 = 3814697,265625\n\n3814697,265625 / 1024 = 3725,290298461914\n\n3725,290298461914 / 1024 = 3,637978807091713 \\~ 3,6GB",

      "Because marketing people won that battle and there haven't been any significant repurcussions to them for deceiving customers, yet.\n\nBytes are usually measured in base 2, but marketing figured out that they can convert that into base 10 and the base 10 number is larger, so it sounds like they're offering more in their product.\n\nPersonally, I think it's totally wrong that they do this, but what can you do?",
      "The capacity is 4 TB. Windows (and some other operating systems) show Tebibytes as Terabyte. 4 Terabytes equal roughly 3.6TiB.",
      "Two reasons.\n\nOne: the manufacturer is counting in groups of 1000 (1000 B = 1 kB, 1000 kB = 1 MB, etc.) Whereas the computer counts by 1024 because 1024 is a power (exponent) of 2 and can be represented easier in the circuitry than 1000s can be.\n\nTwo: formatting. Which is minor but plays a part. Assuming you're on Windows, every drive you have needs to be formatted as \"NTFS\" for Windows to know where it physically put data on the disk. This itself requires some storage space, which is why in nearly every case I've seen, formatted size is not package size. But like I said, this barely makes a dent.\n\nLet's do some math.\n\nAssuming groups by 1000, your 4 TB drive has 4,000,000,000,000 bytes of capacity.\n\nTo the computer, 4 TB is actually 4,398,046,511,104  bytes, meaning you're 398,046,511,104 bytes short. Round that up, you're 0.4 of a TB away from 4 TB. 4 - 0.4 = 3.6, computer reports 3.6",
      "In addition to what people already told you and what makes the largest effect there is also a small effect in the fact that very likely you are using a journaling filesystem, where some metadata is stored apart from the files and space for that is allocated statically as soon as the file system is created. I recon a few hundred Megabyte are used for that on a 4TB drive.",
      "Type this in google \n\n\"4  terabytes to tibibytes\"\n\nYour computer when it says terabytes its using base 2 which to make it clearer tibibytes was invented term",
      "TB = terabyte = 10^12 bytes = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes  \n\nTiB = tebibyte = 2^40 bytes = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes  \n\nSo 4TB is about 3.6 TiB   \n\nOr your drive includes 0.4TB of factory-installed malware that isn't counted in the capacity."

Adobe Premiere doesn't work properly at all with multi CPU systems and only scales up to a certain amount of threads. As far as GPU encoding with it goes, I think it prefers CUDA from Nvidia to OpenCL from AMD as well. \n\n[Puget Systems developed a good benchmarking suite for content creation and also recommends what hardware to use for doing it.](https://www.pugetsystems.com/recommended/Recommended-Systems-for-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-143/Hardware-Recommendations)\n\nedit: Although keep in mind that the charts on that site don't seem to have the newest released CPUs in them yet. The R9 3950x from AMD is a solid choice for your workflow as well and if you render a lot of videos in large batches the new Threadrippers are amazing too. \n\nGamers Nexus reviewed all 3 of them on their own and I think [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QbzcqObIdI) should have them all.",
      "An SSD would be ideal over the 500GB HDD you currently have. Possibly could be the cause of your issues as well but I couldn't say for sure without troubleshooting first. Regardless an SSD would run faster than the HDD. With specs like this, I'm honestly surprised the SSD wasn't specified in the order. HDDs are more prone to failure than SSDs and can fail if they're hit too hard the wrong way, it's certainly possible that the drive became damaged in shipping when the computer was sent to you. Unlikely but possible. A failing hard drive can cause intermittent slowness but you would be seeing that across your entire computer, not just within one program.\n\nYou can pull up task manager while video editing and see if any particular component spikes when you experience the lag. You can also test the hard drive with a number of programs, I use SeaTools which is just a quick download or you can use the built-in Dell diagnostics to test it by booting to F12.",

      "I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nI think this is something I would have professionally printed. Something like Vista Prints photo flip books, and I'm sure other companies offer similar products. You provide the pictures and text and create the layout and they print it. I'd also order multiple copies, because if you are showing it to her or she reads it on a regular basis they will wear out. Not to mention that little hands can have accidents with books.\n\nYou may not need to worry about archival ink if you are going to print this journal out yourself. The reason I say that is if you have all the files, and everything laid out and put together you can just print out new copies when you need them. You could invest in a thermal laminator (I've seen one on sale on Amazon.ca recently) and laminate the pages you print out.\n\nAnd as /u/hobbykitjr said, make sure you back up your photos. Cloud storage like Amazon Prime or Google Photos or Dropbox or whatever. But make sure you have a copy of those files outside of your home. If you have a safety deposit box it might be worth putting a USB stick in there as well. Speaking of USB sticks, if you have a safe and plan on storing a USB stick in it make sure the safe is rated to protect electronics. Most fire proof safes are rated to protect paper from combusting which is apparently a higher temperature than what a USB stick or hard drive can handle.\n",
      "As others have stated, digital format is the way to go. It can potentially last indefinitely. If you're going to do this, please keep in mind the 3-2-1 backup rule to ensure its safety: have at least 3 copies of your data, on at least 2 different types of media, and keep 1 copy offsite.",
      "I'm very sorry to hear what you're going through Ray. I lost my father when I was young, much older than your daughter though, but the redditor who recommended the photobook idea is right on. I absolutely cherish the photos I have of my father and keep them backed up more securely than even my most important encryption keys. \n\nYou might want to try and back up any voicemails you have of her, any texts or emails as well. Maybe ask around for any people who could maybe have video/photos/voice of her. Anything possible that could help your quickly growing daughter to get a better grasp of who her mother actually was on a more personal level. I even cherish some of my father's old Usenet posts. They weren't even of anything really meaningful, just him flaming some Yankees fans about the 2004 Red Sox win. But being able to look back and see a reminder of his personality was a valuable thing to me.\n\nI would recommend having a professional service print the photos, and then backing up all the digital content to multiple places so that they will be accessible for the long distant future regardless of the quality of the actual prints. Photos are going to degrade no matter what they're printed on, digital backups will last for as long as the device is still accessible and will remain the same quality. Don't quote me on this but I'm pretty sure a standard USB flash drive would outlive a printed photo by quite a margin. Maybe buy a good one and throw it in a safety deposit box or something? Anyway, Shutterfly did a great job for me when I made a family photobook a few years ago, they have 50% off deals going on pretty much constantly.\n\nIf you need to have physical photos digitized, there are plenty of services that can easily do so. Just be careful that they don't get lost in the mail, so maybe try to find a local place that can do it. You can do this yourself with Google Photos, but you MUST be sure that each photo was scanned properly. Otherwise you might find out years down the road that an important photo turned out distorted or something.\n\nIf you need any help at all with anything technical now or in the future don't hesitate at all to reply here or send me a message or something.",
      "First of all, sorry for you loss. \n\nSo to start I would focus on digital storage for the long term and physical storage for he short term. \n\n* A paid for service for cloud storage. There are some free services but be careful what they provide. There are some B2C services (business to consumer) and they may also very quickly disappear. (Copy.com a dropbox clone - closed their service last year giving people 3 month's time to move their data)\n* B2B services like AWS S3 tend to be a little more complex to learn (actually it's really easy) but they are industry standard and given the investment of many companies in this technology I don't expect them to go anywhere quick. You should find a college student doing a few websites here and there to set this up on the cheap side if you are not happy to figure it out yourself. AWS Glacier is another service that is even cheaper, but aimed specifically at long term low latency access.\n* Even with a B2B solution, you will have to keep track on a couple of elements, ensure the bills a paid, ensure if the service is closed you will be notified on an email you regularly use, etc. \n* My guess is the best insurance is to use more than one service and a provider that stores in more than one data centre (ie. Nuclear bomb going off scenario) and ideally on more than one continent.  \n* Formats are less likely an issue. Common current formats (JPEG, ...) will be here to stay and even if other standards will take over, digital formats are likely not going to become inaccessible. \n* Physical storage is very different it can both break and access to it may not be possible in a few years time. Even though USB drives may seem the obvious choice - and I'd use that for local storage - they may not be in 20 years time or might fail in the meantime. \n* If you really want to preserve them with no hassle, I am pretty sure services like Arkivum offer long term plans, but their actual commitment will stand and fall with breaking even year by year, so don't trust them blindly. \n\nDo consider the mental aspect.\n\nDon't plan for the next 80-100 years, focus on the next few years when your daughter will be at an age where she can - if she wants - take over control. You have no idea how she will turn out. You may want to keep these images for yourself until you are old, but it should be up to her what she does with them after that. \n\nBut I would plan for the next few years. Don't overburden your daughter with too many pictures, but maybe get a calendar service to print calendars. Link pictures to memories and stories, so your daughter associates the human aspect. At her age she has seen your wife, may associate words with her. Try to keep that memory alive with a few pictures at a time, keep an eye on ensuring she won't be sad. Share or add a new picture every few years. \n\n",
      "Hey, this is a tough situation.\n\nIf you really want to do all the legwork yourself you can but if you're looking for something that will be of quality and easy for you to do, I suggest Shutterfly.\n\nWhen my father died I wanted to make sure my daughter knew him. So we used Shutterfly to make a series of books (they're cheap too)\n\nAll you have to do is create an account, pick your book, pick your layout, upload photos.\n\nwww.shutterfly.com\n\nSorry for your loss I can't imagine.\n\nHope this helps.",
      "Couldn't read through everything but have you considered creating an email address for your daughter?\n\nRegardless of what you do right now with the physical print, I'm sure your daughter would like to have the digitals later in life.\n\nEmail them all to that address for safe keeping and for her future ability to make more of them.\n\nSorry for your loss. Good luck to you.",
      "First off, I'm sorry for your loss.  \n  \nIf you want to make story books and journals of archival quality you are better off letting a professional print it. The reason is that consumer printers are generally crap compared to the professional printers. They might also offer a service to bind the pages as a hardbound book. It will be expensive but you will have a product that will be of much higher quality and as such should also last longer.  \n  \nI would also recommend keeping MULTIPLE (digital) copies of ALL photos and important documents. there is no single format that is bulletproof. I would recommend you keep one copy in the cloud, and 2 copies on external harddrives (they are more reliable then cd/dvd and usb sticks/ssds), preferably 3,5\" models because unlike the 2,5\" ones there should be a standard sata drive in there (making it easier to recover data IF they fail because in my experience the usb chips in the 2,5\" drives tend to fail more often). Those 2 external drives should only be plugged in when you need the data. one of those drives you should keep at your home and one you should keep as far away as reasonably possible (think good friends of family) this is in case your house burns down or in case a natural disaster hits the area where you live.  \nEvery few years you should also create a new copy of the data on the drives to make sure the magnetic fields stay strong and fresh (harddrives can hold data just fine for at least 10years IIRC before weakening magnetic fields might start to become an issue).  \nAlso be sure to check all the files every few years just in case something ends up corrupted.\n  \nI know this sounds like a LOT of work, I won't lie, it IS a lot of work but this should give you the best chance to keep all your important data around in the long run.  \n  \nTL;DR, BACKUPS, BACKUPS, BACKUPS!"

    "post": "Hi There,\n\nSo I figured I should contribute to reddit or something and write maybe a quick guide on how to be successful as a craigslist computer repair technician.  \n\nQuick background on myself.  4 years ago, my wife and I were really poor, I was unemployed, she was working a minimum wage job, we were BARELY paying the bills every month, and we needed to find a way to pay for things without paying $1200 a month for daycare.  So one day I decided to put myself out there on craigslist, and have learned many of these things as I've become successful doing it.  I started out doing this with literally a phillips screw driver and my home computer.  I now have a new car, an ipad I use solely for work, and all kinds of stuff, plus the ability to work from home, life is good. \nI help between 3-4 customers a day.\nI work typically about 3 hours a day, on my own schedule.\nI make about $150 a day on average.\nThe average cost of doing this is roughly $10-15 a day depending on your vehicle, ISP costs, etc.\n\nThings you will need to start.\n$30 to purchase tools. (tool recommendations below) Lots of guides will tell you to buy a big computer toolkit, but you really don't need that. You need \n\n1. PATIENCE, I cannot overstate this enough, this will make or break your business!\n2. Your tools \n3. Cell-phone\n4. Car (optional, increases your income potential by alot tho)\n5. Mobile tools (if you have a car, pick up a cheap basic toolkit from a riteaid or something and just leave it in the car, you'll be surprised how often you use it)\n\nOk, so having read all that you have decided to be a craigslist repair technician, awesome!  If ya do it right, your life is gonna be awesome.  So here goes.\n\nPricing\n-------------------------\nPeople come to craigslist to get deals and to save some money, realize that when your writing your ad.  First lesson I learned pretty fast, is hourly rates DO NOT WORK. In the first two weeks of doing this, I initially charged $25 an hour, I got one customer in 2 weeks. Charge a flat rate!  \nI charge a flat rate and plan on my jobs being fixed or resolved in under 2 hours.  My charge is what I expect to do for 2 hours of work.  So If you want to make $25 an hour, charge $50 to fix someones computer.  This is a HUGE undercut of store services or the Geek squad or staples, your making a great wage, and Saving people a TON of money! You will be absolutely surprised at how often you'll get jobs that take only 20-30 mins to fix, then you just made $50 for 20 mins worth of work!  Conversely tho, this is a #'s game, and you will run into jobs that end up taking for longer to fix than you originally planned.  PATIENCE!!! Doing this kind of work will earn you FUTURE MONEY, suck it up and DO IT, NO COMPLAINTS to the customer either, JUST FIX IT!  I've done screen replacements on unibody macbooks for $30 before, JUST DO IT!\n\nIf you have a car, your going to be making more money, you can now charge a gas surcharge!  Make it reasonable and this will become your bread and butter.  3/4's of what I do is on-site visits now a days, keep some dog treats on you when you go to new customers' houses, they'll freakin love you!\n\nWriting Your Ad\n-----------------------\nCraigslist ads search off of the title and the body of the message.  Make sure to ad things like pc repair, mac, etc to the bottom of the ad to make sure it gets the most visibility.  Your ad will get flagged from time to time, and don't take it personally.  There are quite a few people who make their money off of craigslist and your now a competitor.  Have a good smartphone, get your email on your phone and repost the ad when it gets flagged, and THEY WILL GET FLAGGED.  Your ad can be reposted 5x a day before your account gets locked til the next day.  When someone flags your post, thats great, you just got to top post it for another at least 30 mins.  \n\nIt can be easy to develop flag and ad anxiety if this is your sole income, don't sweat it and just realize that these people are wasting more of their time than yours and enjoy the advertising \"reminder\".  \n\nKeep your ad primarily in computer gigs, if possible also in the barter section if your willing to take trades.  I have gotten so many tools, tablets, mp3 players, movies, tv's, tattoos, etc from having my ad in the barter section it really pays itself off. Got paid in gold dust once, that was kind of cool!\n\nHelpful software\n--------------------------\nNinite - Ninite.com saves me so much time since I probably do a windows install EVERY SINGLE DAY.  People love getting free software and MANY of your customers don't know that the words Free and Antivirus can exist in the same sentence.  You handing out free copies of Microsoft security essentials and open office is like giving lil charlie a golden ticket to your customers!  \nRkill, TDSSKILLER, Malwarebytes, OTM, Gooredfix -  Common tools to remove viruses.  All very useful and can fix most \"viruses\".  There are tons of other alternatives to these, and use w/e your the most comfortable with, but I've found these are fast, lightweight, and easy to use for users, as many times I'll leave a copy with the customer to help themselves in the future.\nWinToFlash - This will let you \"burn\" any version of windows to a bootable usb stick and install it from it, just like the CD.  Great laptops with broken dvd drives and netbooks, etc. \nOther things I keep around are common registry tweaks, like default_exe, taskmanager.reg, wallpaperenable.reg, InstallTake_ownership.reg, etc.\n\n\n\nKey tips!\n----------------------\n1.  Your customers think of you in the same way that many people think of mechanics.  They don't trust you, they think your going to try to screw them over. You will have to prove through your words and your actions that you are worthy of trust.  Trust is your absolute best asset towards growing this kind of business.\n2.  Many of your customers will be people that are FAR FAR FAR from literate with a computer.  Patience and GOOD customer service are FAR more important to the benefit of your business than your actual skill with the computer.  Patience will get you repeat customers!  Repeat customers are the heartbeat of what you do, NEVER take any customer for granted.  I helped a lady in a Starbucks once, she told her boss about me, I got a $1500 EMR contract to help migrate his dentist office to a new medical billing system.  \n3.  Be realistic and DON'T scare people.  People don't want to hear \"You have 300x things wrong with your computer\".  They want to hear \"Oh, don't worry about that too much, I can fix it!\"  You will become their go to computer guy for anything.  Be prepared to take phone calls and don't charge people for stuff like this.  If your willing to bend a little and help people out, they won't be afraid to toss money at you like it's setting their wallets on fire.  I once drove 30 miles to a guy's house to fix his WiFi only to find the WiFi switch was off, I didn't charge him and I've earned him as a repeat customer, and probably made $150 off of him over the course of a year.  If i didn't eat the initial visit, I don't know If he would've kept me around.\n4. Be prepared to not make much for a while until your name gets out there.  Your reputation is WORTH WAY MORE THAN ANY SINGLE JOB! \nDo not take any job your not comfortable with, or don't think you can fix.  Be honest and upfront with people about expectations, and do your best to empower your customers to fix things themselves.  They'll trust you and pay you for the convenience!  Stand by WHAT YOU SAY, and be willing to go the extra mile for your customers, THEY WILL LOVE YOU!\n5. Take pictures of your customers on your phone, and write a small note on their contact (if you have a smartphone) so that you can remember them and what you did for them.  You'll be helping lots of people every month and it can be very hard to remember them all, but people love knowing you remember them.\n6. BE SAFE!  Write down any addresses to new customers and keep them around at your home if you don't know these people.  Let people know where your going.  You are dealing with people off of craigslist, yes most people are awesome, but be prepared for the crazies, which you WILL run into eventually. (yes, I Have crazy people stories)\n\nTools Recommendations\n---------------------------\n1. A precision screw driver set WITH HANDLES, do not get the skinny ones, you'll hate yourself for it.  Something like this is good. \nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PADNxaDfL._SL500_AA300_.jpg\n2. A set of normal steel-shafted screwdrivers.  Stanley has a great set of steel-shaft screwdrivers with an interchangeable handle (not head).  Cost like $10\n3. A solder gun (if you know how, this can increase the variety of jobs you can take) $7 at radio shack. $3 for solder. \n4. An anti-static wristband is typically about $5-7 and is easiest to find in one of those computer toolkits, but can easily be ordered off of amazon also.  \n5. A can of compressed air\n6. A tiny flashlight of some kind. No, your phone is not good enough, Go buy a $1 TINY flashlight that you can hold in one hand without having to mess with touchscreens, it will instantly become your favorite tool.\n7. At minimum a 4gb flash drive. That you can keep on your keychain.\n\nOk, thats all I can think of for right now.  I'll answer any questions anybody has, and best of luck all of you!\n\nEdit 1:  Went to sleep for a few hours, wrote this at 5am, I'm back!\n",

      "Good post. I'd like to add a few things, if I may. I owned computer stores for about 6 years and have fixed thousands of computers. In addition, we did onsite tech support and the things I've learned over the years made my life much easier, so without further ado:\n\n1. Build confidence 1st: When you show up, make sure you look like someone they'd be happy to let in their house. If you have long hair, make sure it's neat. If you have facial piercings, take them out. Wear khakis and a polo shirt. This may all seem like bullshit, but let's be honest, much of your customer base will be older and frankly, they will be instantly prejudiced against someone who looks like what they consider to be a thug. Be confident and comforting. *LISTEN* to them. The more time you spend letting them tell you about what happened with the computer, the better prepared you'll be to deal with it. With that said, keep the conversation focused on the computer. You're there to help them out, not hear about their cat. Don't accept coffee, tea, cookies, or anything like that. You want to appear professional. Your tools should be organized and clean. \n\n2. Work quickly and tell them what you're doing, while you're doing it. Explain every facet of your work. If it's a hardware issue, explain what you're doing and why.\n\n3. Bring paperwork. Before you TOUCH their computer, have them sign a form that indemnifies you from any damage. You're working on a system that's broken, so write on the form specifically what's wrong, note what actions you're taking to fix them, and have them sign both before and after you're done. The first signature is to show they're authorizing you to work on it, the second to document that they're satisfied. This will help you on rework claims.\n\n4. Before you do a data transfer or a virus removal, make sure you explain the risks. People don't like to do this, but it's critical. About 1 in 1000 times, a hard drive will fail during a virus removal. The reason is that most hard drives aren't stressed that hard during normal use and you'll be working on systems that are 10+ years old sometimes. If you're doing a wipe/reload, make sure everything they want is transferred. \n\n5. Test, test, test. Before you tell a customer they need a new computer, test the hell out of it. It's easy to show the customer a screen with a bunch of red indicating their drive is hosed. It's hard to simply tell them they lost gram-grams only photos.\n\n6. Learn to troubleshoot quickly and accurately. This comes from practice but you can help yourself by bringing along the right tools. Also, check out this flowchart. It's pretty good. http://www.fonerbooks.com/poster.pdf\n\n7. Bring good tools. They are, in no particular order -- Power Supply Tester, electric screwdriver with torque control, extra screws, Hirens disk, extra SATA cable, extra IDE cable, Flash drive, air compressor (canned air can suffice in a pinch, but you'll run into some ungodly filthy computers that require more power), windex, paper towels, a notebook computer, and an external hard drive enclosure.\n\n8. Understand that you aren't there to fix their computer -- you're there to solve a problem. Figure out what that problem is 1st, fix their computer second. Ex. Let's say they can't get internet access and they're frantic. Find out *why* they're frantic. Sometimes the issue is they have to send out a critical email, maybe they need a special document for school, or whatever. You need to be able to offer creative solutions if their system is hosed.\n\n9. After you've fixed their computer, MAKE SURE THEY USE IT AND CAN VALIDATE THAT THE PROBLEM THEY HAD IS GONE. I can't stress this highly enough. Let them sit down and play with the system for a few minutes. This will give them more confidence in you, your work, and their newly fixed system.\n\n10. Give bad news gently. If their mobo is bad, show them the swollen or leaking caps (if they are there). If their hard drive is clicking, let them hear it, tell them their options (send off for recovery, etc.). Make sure they know that it wasn't their fault. If their system is riddled with spyware, leave them a sheet with common ways to avoid getting it in the future. Be kind but firm. Remember, you've already shown them the tests that indicate *why* something failed, so it shouldn't come as a shock.\n\n11. Prepare them before you start. When they say, \"My hard drive won't turn on,\" you tell them that when a system won't start up, there are many reasons -- some are simple to fix, some are complex, but you will walk them through the process, every step of the way. If you suspect their hard drive is bad, tell them that you're concerned about it, but you're going to check it out to make sure. Don't work in quiet, then tell them, \"Yeah, it's dead. Everything is gone.\"\n\n12. When you're done and they're satisfied, tape your business card to their computer and tell them that you're available if they have any more questions. \n\n13. Bring extra parts. There's no reason not to have an extra 450+ watt power supply, molex splitters, cables, and RAM with you at all times. It's an easy sale.\n\n14. Sell upgrades. If you get to someone's house and they only have 512mb of RAM, bump it up by a GB, then let them see the difference.\n\n15. Don't forget to tune it up. MSCONFIG is your friend, but remember to make sure every function they did before still works. Too many people disable all sorts of services but forget to re-enable the printer ones. You don't want angry calls that require you to go back.\n\n16. Clean their computer screen and keyboard for them. This may seem stupid, but it's critical. Most of the work you're doing can't be seen -- it's just a bunch of keystrokes. If you clean up their computer, it looks better and they'll feel better about it. When I take my car in, the dealer washes it before they give it back, and even if it's a simple brake job, I feel better about the whole thing. The idea is, you're providing VALUE, not just emergency service. Which brings me to the last piece...\n\n17. Don't apologize for charging them. You have a skill set they don't. You came to their house, you solved their problem, and you are worth what you charge, so don't be embarrassed. On the other hand, don't nickel and dime them. When you suspect what the problem is, give them a high range and a low range of how much it might cost. EX: \"Ma'am, your system won't turn on (don't say boot up) so there are a few things that might be wrong with it. If it's the power supply, it's just going to be $59 to fix and I have a replacement one in the car. If the motherboard is bad, that can run hundreds of dollars and it might be worthwhile to replace the system, but let's test it out and I'll be able to recommend the most cost effective solution.\" By setting their expectations, you prepare them for the worst. When it's just a power supply and their computer is up and running again, you have a happy customer.\n\n18. Ok, I lied. One mroe thing -- give value. Let's say you fixed their power supply. Tune up their system too. Check their antivirus subscriptions. Check their RAM usage. Check their disk fragmentation (I like Iobit's tool as well as Acronix's, but to each his own). You want them to feel like they got a bargain because they called you and you want them to tell all their friends about you. It's not enough that you repaired their computer. You need to *fix their problem* and do it quickly, professionally, and inexpensively. \n\nIf you do this, your business will grow quickly and you'll have awesome customers.\n\nOh, one last thing -- you can't please everyone. Some people will be horrible to you no matter what, so don't fret. Cut them loose, leave, and don't bother with them again. You're doing everything you can to protect yourself by having them sign papers, by being friendly, and by knowing your shit, but there are people out there who will try to fuck you over, just because they suck.\n\nAnyway, hope this helps. I could write a book about this (actually, I did, but it's under my real name) but this should help you get started.",

I am skeptical since I recently downloaded a virus myself and got rid of it with a factory reset without the use of another computer. \n\nIts also possible that they will be bringing physical hardware that they can connect directly into my computer.\n\nWhat can I do to protect my computer while they are here? I am thinking of maybe creating a guest user so that they can use the computer without administrative privileges, or having access to my files. will this be sufficient to protect my computer?

What a joke. What would it even mater anyway, the hacker isn't going to come and update his hacks. This all seems very fishy to me and I would not trust these people.\n\nJust tell your grand mother with the amount of college work is on there and the fact you need it for school, you can't take the risk of anyone messing with your computer.

This guy is full of shit.\n\nModern, good quality chargers - that's OEM chargers, Anker, a handful of others - are going to provide a very high quality level of power to the device. Low noise, very tight voltage variation, good current.  Less expensive power supplies will often provide noisier power at a lower quality, but the charging IC on the phone deals with it.  If the power quality is too low, it simply won't charge.  At absolute worst, a faulty power supply might fry your phone's charge circuit - but it won't affect the battery unless it's wired directly to AC power (some are damned close...) in which case it will destroy the phone.\n\nAs far as charging speed, the phone dictates that - and all other things being equal, slower is better.  Slower means less heat, less heat means longer life.  So as far as battery life, the USB port built into your TV is better than a fast-charge OE power supply.",

    "post": "I was at my sisters house eating dinner with my family when I looked at my phone and saw 3 push messages; A PayPal payment to OPSkins for $1030.18, a payment to G2A for $534.77 and my Steam Guard sending me a message so I could log into my steam account. I logged onto my email and saw that I had 4 Amazon orders. One for $99.98, then one for $49.99, another for $49.99, and the last one which didn't go through because I didn't have enough money in my checking account.\n\nI called paypal first and filed a claim on the 2 charges saying that I didn't make the purchases. Next I called Chase and said I didn't make those purchases. Then I contacted Amazon and told them what happened. Amazon was able to cancel them right away because they were for Playstation Network cards and they had not been used yet. Here comes the part that freaked me out... PayPal rejected my claim because \"nothing was out of order\". The purchases came from my IP address, on my AT&T internet, and they said everything matched up as if I had been sitting on my home PC and placed the orders. I went onto OPSkins.com (to which I had been banned because I filed the claim through PayPal first) I disputed the ban and told them what happened. They told me it was through my IP address so I was full of it. I was also banned on G2A, but I couldn't find a way to contact them. All of these orders were purchased on my accounts. They logged into my PayPal, my Amazon, my G2A, and my OPSkins accounts. It only stopped them when Steam Guard came up (when I am assuming they tried to trade the skins they bought on my account to another one). I have a surveillance camera in my home, no one was here. Could this have been done through hacking into my network/PC?\n\nSomething else that I found out: $1000 was added to my OPskins account, then an additional $500 was added to my account from G2A pay. So there was a total of ~$1500 in my OPSkins account. I asked OPSkins what the last purchases made on my account were and they told me \"Sticker | Martha\". 2 of them. One was sold to me for $999.80, and the other was sold to me for $499.90. The item \"Sticker | Martha\" is $0.48 on the steam marketplace right now. So I am assuming that the person who got into my account was the same person who was selling these items. I contacted OPSkins and asked them what information they could give me of the person who was selling those 2 items. I have been waiting for a reply ever since. I doubt they will do anything about it, but I really hope that I can get some information to report to the authorities.\n\nTL;DR - Someone hacked into my Amazon, Paypal, OPSkins, and G2A and now I am out $1564.95.

Keep in mind that internet speeds are measured in Megabits.\n\n1MB (Byte) = 8mb (Bits)\n\nSo, if Steam said I was downloading at 3 MB/s, that means it's eating up 24mb/s of my internet connection.\n\n-------------\n\nAnyway, let's pull up [a proper speed test](https://testmy.net/) and verify what we're really getting before continuing!\n\nLet's say the result is considerably less than 75mb/s (I'd argue anything below 60mb/s is unacceptable). What now?\n\nCall up your ISP support and ask to create a ticket. They'll probably make you do all manner of inane busywork (modem shenanigans, speedtests at their specific super special site, filling out an email template, etc.), but keep pushing until you have a ticket number and they do a line test.\n\nThere's a very good chance that, once they do the line test, they will see poor signal and maybe timeouts. If they don't see issues, ask that they escalate the ticket (take down an escalation number, if at all possible). Usually this will prompt someone with more experience to eventually look at the ticket and figure out what's really going on.\n\nAlso, just a heads up! You will have a much better (and likely more successful) experience with technical support if you wait a week or two from now before doing any of this. Right now, most of the core support teams are going to be on vacation and your call will likely get routed someplace that doesn't do holidays (AKA: call mills).",

The ISP comes out and they can connect and transfer at 75Mbps no problem. Then it's your router, PC, Ethernet cable, console, WiFi card, etc..  \n  \nLet's say you run a speed test and get [close to] 75Mbps. Then it's the game server that's slow. Their Internet connection or server isn't guaranteed to match what your ISP delivers to you.  \n  \nNow let's say you have cable. You never get more than around 3Mbps on any speed test or other service. The ISP comes out and finds out your signal strength is terrible (they should also be able to see it without being there, sometimes they can't though). Now it's up to the ISP to determine why the signal is bad. If it's the cable in your house, you may be responsible for fixing it or paying for the ISP to fix it.  \n  \nIf you have DSL, maybe you're too far away from the CO.  \n\nThere's also a very small chance that your ISP didn't provision you for 75Mbps, but the billing records show 75Mbps. This usually isn't intentional unless you break ToS or exceed your monthly usage too often. If that's not the case, they can probably 'refresh' the account to somehow correct the error. Sometimes refreshing it requires them to change your plan and then revert back.  \n  \nThat doesn't cover every possibility, but it's possible that it really isn't your ISP's fault. If it's a decent ISP, they'd know if it was their fault. I have Comcast and pay for 150Mbps. I can get double that some days. I also had to pay to have new cable run from the street to my house and then inside the house 10 years ago because it was old and extremely shitty and I was in the same boat as you. As a band-aid, they 'bumped up the signal' going to my house until it could be fixed.. but it was not a long term solution, and there are technical reasons for that.",

      "It could have been something the leasing company does with all their leases, and they failed to remove it when it was sold.  That said you could have a civil suit against the car dealership who sold you the car with a tracking device that you were not aware it had.  It could be an innocent mistake, or it could also be something the dealership does with cars where they do the financing, even through a bank.  You may have even signed off on it in the mountains of paperwork that they make you sign when you buy a car.\n\nSome rental car companies put them in some of their fleet, and some businesses do also, and since they own the car they are free to do that.  Some insurance companies also put them in cars of some of their customers, but of course have to have their permission.  Since it was inside the car in a steering column the person who installed it had a bit of time to access it and install it, possibly even a professional.\n\nIt is a bit disturbing, but I seriously doubt the manufacturer of the device is going to give you any information as to who bought it.  Of course they would have to if there was a court order for them to give that information.  The police could potentially help, but doubt it will be something they will actively pursue.  They can find out the owner of the device.\n\nYou are of course free to destroy the device, or see if you could find a lawyer who might take the case on a contingency basis on any settlement.  Even if you signed off unknowingly on the installation on the device I would still raise all kinds of hell about this invasion of privacy by whoever put in the device.",

Do you have a extremely jealous untrusting gf possibly etc or a stalker. Any marking or brands on the unit? I\u2019d have it looked at by the dealership but have no one remove it to try and wash there hands of any complaints.

It could also be the company who held the loan.

Those things have issues and cause all types of electrical issues down the line. I wouldn\u2019t attempt to remove it yourself if you\u2019re not comfortable with automotive work.",
      "Hey man I know I'm a little late to the party but I worked for a dealership that had a buy here/pay here side attached to our main dealership and I actually started on the collections and finance side before I moved to sales so I'm very familiar with the tracking devices dealerships use. Both the larger ones attached to the battery that can be used to disable a vehicle and the smaller one you can essentially slip anywhere just as a back up. Just to put your mind at ease first of all those devices aren't on all the time like say the GPS unit in your phone which is literally tracking you. \n\nThe devices on cars have to be \"pinged\" by someone at a computer who has access to both your account information or number and the system used with that devices. It send a one time snapshot every time it is pinged by the person at the computer but its not \"tracking\" you all the time. When I was working collections we only pinged people who were either behind in their payments or had discontinued contact with the finance company.  People who paid on time we never had a reason to ping their location. They were good customers why would we? Furthermore the dealership pays a subscription to use the service that pings vehicles locations.  If you paid off your loan two years ago there is a very good chance the finance company doesn't even have a way to ping your vehicles location anymore because your account should be closed. They're not going to pay for the ability to locate a car they don't hold the title to anymore. \n\nAlso the dealership you bought your car from might not have even known it was under your steering column. If they took the car as a trade in from someone else who bought it as a buy here pay here the account has probably been inactive for years.\n\nFinally some people have suggested that you may have had your right to privacy violated somehow but that's just not how it works. Ya'll watch too many legal dramas but clearly don't spend enough time around contracts or actual lawyers. When you buy a car from a dealership there is a reason the paperwork takes hours and hours. There is always language in the contract giving the dealership the right to put a GPS on a vehicle that they're selling unless you're paying cash day of. But like I said once you paid off your loan they probably lost their ability to ping your cars location. OK I hope this was helpful",

If this isn't the right place could someone kindly refer me to the correct subreddit? Thank you.\n\nEdit:\nHi guys, thank you all for your time and advice I am truly grateful. Some people were asking for an update so I'm just going to lay out my plan for now. For now, my steps will be to create a master email with my important information using Protonmail, switching over to a password manager, and freezing my credit. I will also be cleaning up my hardware just to eliminate any variables. I did some digging and found some of my accounts on database leaks which would explain the initial breach but I am still a bit confused as to how it could be happening as it was 3 years ago and I have added many security measures since then. I probably won't have an update on effectiveness as this is something that happens occasionally to me every couples months so I won't know the impact of these changes immediately. The only immediate thing that is clear to me is I am being targeted.",

      "Have you considered that your identity in general has been compromised? Have you frozen your credit? If not you should do that immediately.  \n\n\nHave you formatted your machine and reinstalled Windows? If not, that should be done as it is possible your virus scans are not helping.   \n\n\nHave you considered that it could be someone you are close to/know that have access to your devices? Think about that one.  \n\n\nMost importantly how do you know you have been compromised so many times? Are you getting calls from your bank/ CC companies? Do you have people trying to change your passwords? What exactly is alerting you to this behavior?",

      "Please update post when you get the chance OP",
      "You got your hands full. Here's my suggestion. Read all the way to the end before you implement!!!\n\n1. Secure professional help. Someone has you in their sights, and you, as a lay person, do not have the tools needed to protect yourself from this.\n2. If you insist on trying it your way, first thing to do is to create a new e-mail address on a system you know is clean (reformatted by someone you trust, or yourself) and is running on a clean connection (cellular service or direct connection to the net, or alternatively, on a router you know to be properly secured and clean). This will be your new e-mail address and your new digital life. Do not use this address for anything but associating your most commonly used services. It's password should be a complex password that includes letters, numbers, special characters, and more than 10 characters total. Recovery information should be equally complex -- your mother's name should be mA&4HfDE-AreZ9 or something similar for this one e-mail. You might factory reset an Android phone specifically for this one account, and set 2FA up on that phone. Google is an excellent choice here, as is MSN. Make this e-mail address completely different from any other address you have, if at all possible. \n3. Once you do that, sign up for [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/). Use the e-mail you used above, and that same very complex password. Set 2FA up on Lastpass as well. (Caveat: if you have a different password manager besides LastPass, you can use that. I only recommend LastPass because it's what I use, but that's not a requirement to use this exact product to manage PWs) Now, you are out of the business of making and remembering passwords from here on out. Your LastPass Password (which you use for your Google E-Mail you just created, and will use for your Windows password) is the only password you'll ever remember.  \n4. Learn how to use your password locker! That is, read the documentation, get familiar with how it works, and get familiar with how to create secret notes, memos in accounts, and any other feature it offers. Spend a good 30 minutes to an hour with the manual. \n5. Make a list of your most critical and essential services. This should include your bank, your main public facing e-mail, your work e-mail, your school e-mail, your social media sites, and anything else you feel is a life-ender if it's hacked. \n6. For each site identified in Step 5\n   1. Log into the service. \n   2. Reset the e-mail the service is connected to to the e-mail created in Step 2 above.\n   3. Reset the password using LastPass to a random collection that satisfies the site's requirements. \n   4. Reset the Secret Questions to random gibberish, which you store in LastPass's comment field for the account. \n   5. Enable 2FA if at all possible. Ideally, use the e-mail account created in Step 2 as the 2FA address. \n7. Repeat Step 5 and 6 as you feel necessary. \n8. Consider never signing into the master e-mail on a computer that is used for gaming, pr0n, or warez. \n9. Keep in mind that key-loggers can sniff your passwords. So can packet sniffers. Verify that none of your connected devices are hacked. This includes wifi access points, computers, phones, and internet of things devices. You might want to eliminate all unnecessary hardware on your network and trim down what you're using until you can validate each device is clear of infection. \n10. Seriously examine and re-evaluate your cyber habits. Opening attachments, visiting badware sites (pr0n, warez, but even legit sites), password reuse, not securing your PC, weak passwords, shared passwords, insufficient infrastructure security, and lack of attention to changing security threats are a threat to multi-billion dollar corporations and mom and pop networks alike. Security is not a one and done affair, bro. It's an ongoing thing, so you might consider reevaluating your security posture on at least a yearly basis, if not quarterly. Take a cyber-security training course while you're at it, as retake that course regularly. Threats change, and before you can practice safe hex, you need to know what the changes are. \n11. Seriously consider closing unused and unneeded accounts! A simpler net presence is an easier net presence to defend! \n12. With all the above steps in mind, you might seriously consider retaining professional help as mentioned in Step 1. Depending on the sophistication of your hacker and your own cyber habits, you might just be making a new e-mail and password locker account for your hacker. \n\nThere are a plethora of tools to look into. Microsoft's Authenticator, perhaps? Or Google's version (though an advantage of Google being your primary e-mail is Android is itself an authenticator tool). As you can see, there's a whole heck of a lot of moving pieces, and these pieces change from day to day as old pieces are compromised and new ones are developed. I am not kidding when I say you may need professional help. Equifax needs professional help!  XD"

      "As /u/iamofnohelp said you need to backup that data.\n\n1997 means no SATA (SATA was introduced in 2000), the drives will be the old PATA ribbon type. You also will not have USB (USB 1.1 was introduced in 1998). You can't just plug in a USB card either, most anything you find today will require a PCI-e connection, which also came after your PC. This makes backing up the data a bit of a challenge.\n\nMagnetic media degrades overtime so you may well run into read errors once you access the drives. That also means you want to minimize reads and writes as much as possible until you've backed up your data.\n\nI think your best option is to get a USB adapter that supports PATA, one like this, [AGPtek SATA/PATA/IDE Drive to USB 2.0 Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/AGPtek-Drive-Adapter-Converter-External/dp/B00BIE996S), then connect the drive from the old PC to a newer one using that adapter. (FYI: PATA=IDE, same thing, different terms)\n\nThat avoids the stress of the old drive trying to boot and, if you get access, you can copy the data directly to the newer PC. It also means if there are problems reading the data you can use modern recovery software to try and still get to the data.\n\nOtherwise, if you just boot the old PC and it works, you still have to figure out a way to copy the data. Without USB that means burning a CD, assuming the old PC has a CD drive capable of that, not a given on a 1997 PC.\n\nEdit: Ok.  I get it, there are adapters. He can plug a USB into his old machine or his PATA into a new machine. Still, KISS is best, I stand by my advice to just use a cheap usb adapter and connect it to a new machine that way.",

Thank you so much /u/Sezhe and /u/stoopid_monkey254 I really thought it was curtains there hahahahahaha\n\nOn the off chance that someone ever does this and stumbles on this thread in seventy years, here is a consolidated version of what I had to do. Unless you disabled the exact same drive as me (\"Generic USB Hub\"), it won't *exactly* fit what you need to do, but it should give you a better idea. It involves fucking with your registry, so if you're unfamiliar with that please be very careful!!!\n\nThe problem this solves is the mistake of going into Device Manager and disabling a device called \"Generic USB Hub\". This disabled your USB ports, leaving you unable to use your mouse or keyboard to re-enable that device!\n\n**Note:** Before you get into this stuff, see if your computer has a PS/2 port. If you're not sure what that looks like, Google it. It's a real old looking port that peripherals like mice and keyboards connected to in like, the 1740s. That port will bypass USB input, so if your PC has one of these ports and you can get your hands on a mouse that fits in it, you can probably use that mouse to re-enable the device. If your computer has no PS/2 port, welcome to Hell! Please read on!\n\n**1.** I booted Windows into Recovery mode. This is a barebones blue screen, with buttons on it, so if you get to that you're on the right path. One can get to Recovery by booting from a USB drive that has Windows' Recovery stuff burned onto it in advance, but I ... Couldn't figure out how to do that, frankly.\n\nSo, uh, if you're also having problems with the USB drive thing, Google methods of getting into Windows Recovery! I'm using Windows 8.1, and I'm not positive of this method's efficacy on other versions, but I was able to get into it by:\n\nHolding the power button to shut my laptop off, then, turning it back on. Then, *while* Windows was booting, I held the power button to shut off the laptop again and interrupt the boot process. This is kind of aggravating and could take a couple tries. Make sure you don't hold the power button during the screen that shows your laptop's manufacturer, like \"ASUS\" or \"Intel\", etc. There should be a Windows boot screen while you're holding down the power button. Once the laptop has turned off a 2nd time ... Go ahead and turn it back on\n\nIf you've done it right, Windows shouldn't boot normally! It should say something like \"Please wait\", and take you to the aforementioned blue screen, with some junk about how Windows couldn't start properly. Welcome to Windows Recovery! You'll find that the mouse and keyboard probably work here! Huzzah! There is still more to do, though, for them to function in the normal Windows environment\n\n**2.** You will probably see 2 buttons that say \"Restart\", and something like ... \"Advanced options\". Click the advanced options. You should see buttons that say things like, \"Continue\", \"Troubleshoot\", \"Turn off your PC\".\n\nNow, the exact buttons might vary between, say, Windows 8 and 10, so I'm hesitant to just spell out exactly what buttons you need to click. but the gist is: You need to be going *deeper* into Windows recovery to find more options. Just for a few clicks. Don't continue to Windows, don't shut off your computer, don't \"refresh\" or \"reset\" your computer. Just click \"Troubleshoot\", and if from there you see ... \"Advanced options\", again, click that. That's all it takes on 8.1. \n\nYou should end up at a screen with ... 5 or 6 options, it looks like this https://i.imgur.com/AbZWHyz.png\n\n**Before you go any further, try System Restore! See if you have any Restore Points. They might take you back to before you disabled that device, and end this whole thing. If you're like me, and you have no Restore Points, just hit \"Cancel\" and read on. If you *can* do a System Restore, and it doesn't fix the problem for some reason ... Just follow the guide back up to this point, I guess.**\n\nAnyway, I stole that screenshot from a YouTube video where the guy had \"Command Line\", circled, which is convenient because, assuming a System Restore didn't work, you're gonna want to click on Command Line. Click on Command Line!\n\n**3.** A black window should open. This is Command Line. If you're totally unfamiliar, this is how you interact with your computer through nebulous text-based commands instead of clicking on things, or typing in lots of different boxes. Fortunately, I'm going to tell you what commands you need to type in. Please type them verbatim, and check carefully for typos! They're very short and simple, though, so you're probably going to be fine\n\nFirst, you need to know what hard drive you have Windows installed in!\n\nHard drives are usually denoted by a single letter with a colon after it, like A: or B: or C: or D:. In most cases, the hard drive Windows is installed on is labeled C: by default. This is probably the case for you. But, if you'd like to be *sure* that Windows is installed on C:, *or,* if you'd like to see all the available hard drives in order to *locate* the one with C: on it, you can use Command Line to do that\n\n**You can skip the following section if you're reasonably sure which hard drive you have Windows installed on**\n\nType the following command, and hit enter\n\n>wmic logicaldisk get name\n\nThis should list every available drive. To test which of these has Windows on it, you need to \"switch\" to each of these drives, and run this command on it:\n\n>dir\n\nTo \"switch\" to a drive, you just type its name. Like this: \n\n>c:\n\nOr\n\n>d:\n\nSo just go down this list like so. Your commands should go like ...\n\n>a:\n\n>dir\n\n>b:\n\n>dir\n\n>c:\n\n>dir\n\nOnly, you might not have an a: drive or a b: drive. Just modify this process to include the drives that were listed before\n\nEach time you use \"dir\", a list should come up. What you're looking for is a list that has stuff like ... \"Program Files\", or \"Program Files (x86)\". These are folders in the top level of your hard drive. These folders won't be relevant to fixing your computer, but they are the indicators that you are indeed on the right hard drive. So, if you do \"dir\" and see these folders, you are on the right drive.\n\n**End of possibly skippable section**\n\nSo, if you're confident that Windows is installed on C:, go ahead and type this, then hit enter:\n\n>c:\n\nGreat! Now we're going to open the program that you're going to use to fix your computer. Just type the following:\n\n>RegEdit\n\nVoila! A new window opens. Welcome to RegEdit! Now you get to click on stuff again! Goodbye, Command Line.\n\n**4.** Welcome to RegEdit. It's kind of an insane labyrinth of folders. But, it's going to let you dig around in your computer's guts and flip that device's switch back to \"on\", since you can't do it the easy way. I'll tell you what you need to do\n\n***Please* don't go all willy nilly in this program.** You're safe to navigate around it freely but, hold your horses on anything that involves opening a right-click menu, ok?\n\nYou should see 2 panels. The one on the left shows a series of folders. Probably something like:\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT ... and, HKEY_CURRENT_USER ... and, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE ... and, HKEY_USERS ... and, HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG\n\nGive HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE a single click, to select it. Then, on the top bar of the program, click \"File\". Then, click \"Load Hive\"\n\nA file browser window will come up. This is how you'll select the Hive you need to load. Click \"This PC\" on the left. Click on C:, or whichever hard drive you have Windows on, probably C:. In this window it might have the name OSDisk. It's probably C:!\n\nNow, navigate into this series of folders: \n\n>Windows\n\n>System32\n\n>config\n\nIn the folder \"config\", you're looking for a file called \"SYSTEM\". There are *two* files with this name. One is a text file, the other is just a ... \"File\". Unlabeled. You want to select the file that is ***not*** a text file. Then click \"Open\".\n\nThe file browser window will close, and you'll be back on RegEdit. A window will come up, asking you to assign a name to the Hive you just loaded. Type *anything* into this box, like \"blah blah blah\" or something, then click Ok.\n\nClick on the arrow next to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, to uncollapse it and reveal its contents! You should see several folders with names like HARDWARE, SAM, SECURITY, SOFTWARE, and SYSTEM. One of these folders should be named after the text you type in, \"blah blah blah\" or what have you. Uncollapse this folder\n\nKeep uncollapsing folders and follow this path:\n\nblah blah blah --> ControlSet001 --> Enum --> USB\n\nYou should see lots of folders with names that follow this general pattern:\n\nVID_8087&PID_0020\n\nVID_10C4&PID_8105\n\nIn all of the folders that follow this name scheme, you can find at least two (maybe one?) folders. Each of these folders has an even more gibberish name, such as: 5&35f39389&0&1\n\n**These folders with even more gibberish-y names are what you need to sift through.**\n\nUp until this point, you've had no reason to care about the information being displayed on the right side of RegEdit as you navigate. Now is when you're gonna need to start looking at that stuff\n\nWhat you want to do is uncollapse all of the folders inside Enum\\USB, and start looking at those folders that are the most gobbledegooky in name. Each time you highlight one, a list of different features will appear in that right panel. Within the right panel, these consist of certain labels on the left, and what those labels are set to, on the right\n\nYou're only going to be concerned with **two** labels, and you're only going to need to edit **one.**\n\n**Please note that this is where you may have to trailblaze a bit.** I can't guarantee that you disabled the *exact* same device as I did. But I'll explain the labels you're looking for\n\nThe first label is called **ConfigFlags.** You'll notice that this is set to **0** a lot. The value of it is represented in hexadecimal (Like this: 0x00000000), but it always has a decimal value at the end in parentheses. Just look at the decimal value to keep it simple\n\nIf you see a folder that has **ConfigFlags** set to specifically **1**, *you should look at the other relevant label to cross-reference them and make an educated guess as to whether this is the device you disabled.*\n\nThe second label is called **DeviceDesc.** Below is an example of just one thing DeviceDesc might be set to:\n\n>@usb.inf,%usb\\class_09.devicedesc%;Generic USB Hub\n\nAs you can see, gobbledygook but with a clearly readable device name appended at the end there. You might have to drag the \"Data\" tab in RegEdit out a bit so there'll be room to display all the text\n\n**So.**\n\nAll the pieces are in place. You want to find something with **ConfigFlags** set to **1** and a feasible **DeviceDesc** for it to *be* the device you disabled. This will, of course, be easiest if you recall the act of disabling it, y'know, what you right-clicked just before doing so\n\nIf you think you've found the device, just right-click \"ConfigFlags\" and click Modify. Make sure the Base option is still set to \"Hexadecimal\", and type **0** into the field. Then click Ok\n\n**Again, I strongly caution against editing any values except for ConfigFlags! And even then, I would be discerning about what you change! Messing with the registry can mess Windows up to a degree far worse than just lost USB functionality!** To be fair, I'm not *entirely* sure how much damage you can do in this part of the registry, exactly, but I am not that versed in RegEdit so, like a caveman terrified of an automobile, I will just tell you to use lots of caution\n\nAnyway, if you think you've gotten it taken care of, reboot your computer, and hopefully you'll have USB functionality again! Good luck.\n\n----- ----- ----- Original Post ----- ----- ----- \n\nThis happened while I was trying to fix an issue on Windows 8.1, where no keyboards were working on my laptop, something messed up about their drivers\n\nWhile messing with Device Manager and trying to fix this, I made the grave mistake of disabling the \"Generic USB Hub\" device. This disabled all USB ports, preventing me from even using my mouse to do anything, such as re-enable the godforsaken \"Generic USB Hub device\"\n\nI held the power button and restarted, hoping the device might re-enable, but it did not. I am now completely incapable of interacting with anything once the Windows login screen comes up\n\nMy only options seem to be the laptop's BIOS, and the Windows troubleshooting menu I can access by holding the power button while Windows is booting. I haven't found anything thus far in these menus that will alleviate this, though\n\nI've tried booting into Safe Mode, but the driver is still disabled there, so it's still uninteractive\n\nI also have no system restore points\n\nMy laptop does not have a PS/2 port, so that doesn't seem to be an option either\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice for escaping this Hell that I have created for myself through my own ineptitude! Thank you!!!",

This is happening with others that have the exact same work supplied model computer at their homes.  After some rather quick investigation I came up with this reasoning and sent it to her:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Link to your Lenovo model computer:*\n\n[*https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/desktops/thinkcentre/m-series-tiny/m73/*](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/desktops/thinkcentre/m-series-tiny/m73/)\n\n*Scroll down to Tech Specs/Processor and you will see the G3220T is the last on the list, the least powerful and below the i3.*\n\n*Link to Encompass requirements:*\n\n[*http://help.elliemae.com/DocumentationLibrary/360/SystemRequirements.pdf*](http://help.elliemae.com/DocumentationLibrary/360/SystemRequirements.pdf)\n\n*Scroll to page 3 for Encompass. You can see all 3 versions require a minimum of i3, i5, or i7 at 2.8 GHz. Your processor is a lower tech and only at 2.6 GHz.*\n\n*Link CPU Performance Benchmarks:*\n\n[*http://www.cpu-upgrade.com/CPUs/Intel/Pentium\\_Dual-Core/G3220T.html*](http://www.cpu-upgrade.com/CPUs/Intel/Pentium_Dual-Core/G3220T.html)\n\n*Scroll all the way to the bottom chart. You will see the i7\u2019s down to i3\u2019s at the top. All the way at the bottom is the G3220T, 3rd from last on the chart.*\n\n*The CPU is running harder and hotter than it should to keep up and still not able to meet the performance of the program which will cause lag and crashes during use. It also will shorten the life of the CPU by constantly running it at that level.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe IT guy says that this isn't the issue and is still insisting it is something else like internet connection (we have a very solid 100+ Mbps connection, connected by hard line since the wireless on that computer kept dropping) or malware. The program listed is just one of the programs being run at the same time in addition to outlook, word, excel, and other needed apps. I guess I am just trying to figure out if my logic is flawed because he seems so adamant that it isn't hardware related.",

      "If the IT guy is the person responsible for recommending this model to the company, its very possible he is trying to save his own ass.\nIts very clear this machine is too under-powered to multitask while running the Encompass software. How much RAM does it have? that could be a big factor as well.",
      "I work for a MSP. Most cases if the old pc is anything less than an I3 we just tell the client buy a new pc. The work we will need to put in to try and make it functional will probably be half the price of a low end machine that\u2019s 10 times better",

Not only this, but if it has a Pentium it probably doesn't have a whole lot of ram.\n\nAlso was the computer new or used when it was given to her? \n\nIf used that old disk drive probably isn't running that well either. \nEDIT - down below he mentions an SSD is in the computer\n\nOverall I'd say the computer just needs to be replaced and it's nothing that is y'all's fault (malware, damage, slow internet, etc.)",
      "You didn't mention how you determined the system is using the G3220T. There's several configurations listed on the lenovo website for  processors.  If that's right you are correct that it's underpowered for the software.  If you aren't sure, she can run Msinfo32 to pull up system specs including processor and physical memory.  The memory is the other potential big factor in slowness and crashing, especially if she's running several other applications at the same time.",
      "Ok, we've not established what actual spec the machine is, or that the software is actually run locally, or via TS or Citrix etc. \n\nAssuming Windows 10, right-click on the start button (bottom left, usually) and click \"System\".

I do IT support on the place I work at and we have even worst stations here but all our software are cloud based.",
      "> so slow, get numerous lock-ups, and some programs just outright crash\n\n>  something else like internet connection\n\nAbsolutely zero probability of that. IT Guy is either bullshitting you or completely and utterly incompetent, either way you should try to escalate this past them.",
      "Your logic is sound, but a conclusion can't be made IMO. Have you looked at the performance monitor in the task manager while your wife is running what she needs to run? Is the event viewer showing any crashing that you had mentioned? There are error codes when software crashes. It's not always telling, but it's certainly better than guessing.\n\nThis is most certainly coming from a Deskside/IT Support professional. Also, allow me to provide some insight on this end as well:There is no gain for saving budget on equipment. It's likely your IT guy has literally no stake in what hardware is allocated. There are purchasing teams, budget codes, etc that are approved for teams within an organization. The specs on your machine ARE quite low, but you're an end user talking to other end users who don't like their IT branded answers it sounds like.\n\nAs an IT professional who takes tremendous pride in troubleshooting, setting realistic expectations, and exercising polite communication skills--I would say this really shouldn't be a battle of \"you vs the IT guy\". As a person in the industry, we hear theories and ideas and \"research\" all the time from end users who are going down rabbit holes that aren't a direct solution to the problem, or cannot properly assess the root cause of a problem but still research until they get *A* solution.\n\nYou've posted in the right spot. Check event viewer for crashing apps and jot down error codes. Look at your performance monitor in task manager while the laptop gets slow. Also, you said these systems are in people's homes. How is the IT guy to know that you're constantly leaving the laptop powered on and active while connected to the VPN client to enable group policy pushes to ensure your system is up to date? This actually could be an internet connection issue, have you done a proper test on your download/upload speeds to numerous servers to get some aggregate information on your connection speed? Have you updated your NIC driver to ensure your wife's laptop isn't choking on internet speed when your router/modem is outputting the quoted 100+ Mbps?\n\nThere are so many things, and end users often get SO many ideas an opinions. The truth is, the IT guy probably doesn't have any stake in which laptops are ordered, and there may need to be a revision on equipment. Unfortunately, it should take a few tickets put in to raise the flag that it's not just one end user. I don't know of any IT team that could sustain providing bad customer service, bad computer equipment to save a dollar, and a general unwillingness to take a sample of tickets and assess new hardware needs in your wife's workplace environment.\n\nI didn't write this with the intention of being biased to the IT pro. I didn't mean to make this long either. You may be right in the hardware needs, and being able to challenge the first opinion you hear is your option so long as you do more than googling minimum tech specs.\n\nTL;DR: This seems pretty one-sided, and most of the comments on the top upvotes so far seem like end users as well.",

      "Okay, so I could be completely wrong here, but I've been having a similar issue. I live in a very high up apartment and it's winter here so things get charged up with static electricity very easily and discharges on fixtures and appliances very violently, like you can actually see the arc, and everyone here has this weird shock-therapy-induced habit of discharging themselves using a shoulder on a door frame before touching a tap or light switch or doorknob. Anyway, I did some experimenting, and it seems like whenever someone who is charged-up walks directly between my wireless router and PC, the connection stutters for a moment and disconnects certain real-time services like IRC, streaming games, and Twitch. This is the second year this is happening, ever since they renovated my building and redid the plumbing, even with me using a different wireless router, and it only happens during winter when someone walks by. My first thought is possible RFI, although I don't know how much RFI a human body could generate when they're carrying a large static charge. If your Ethernet cable isn't properly shielded and you're also living in a dry climate and the door isn't properly grounded and is maybe rubbing on carpet or something, perhaps it's also an RFI issue.\n\nEDIT: Keep in mind the interference could be happening at the modem, the router, or the co-axial cable, depending on their location relative to the doorway or corridor, and not necessarily the Ethernet cable itself.",

So, for example, when watching youtube or twitch or using discord, the service in question has some buffering so that tiny outages like that don't effect your experience, but in a live game like League, losing internet immediately kicks up warnings and may even drop you to a menu.\n\nTo prove it's not just League, why don't you download TF2 and pop into a game of 2fort or Hightower, and then swing the door.

      "Are you using the same router in your apartment but the building's ISP changed? Network being up is probably just the connection between you and the router (the wifi) ... maybe the router has the WAN (internet) information from the old ISP hard-coded in it, rather than it using DHCP to get an address from the main router in your building. Google how to do a factory reset of your apartment router then start over. \n\nThis is all assuming you wanted help with the computer not the pregnancy",
      "> UPDATE: I got my landlord to take me to the basement and the ISP installers had disconnected a bunch of random cables, including half of he ones that run to my apartment. Problem solved! Thanks to everyone who responded! \n\nHe should have checked before letting them leave.  Reminds me of a job I was doing a change over and cell failover setup for.  I  do the final connection and it doesn't work.  I take apart the standard jack box/biscuit for the previously done t-1 extension.  It's not punched down.  Cables are just loosely placed inside the biscuit.  Some people do shitty work.  Quick fix, but a silly one to have to do at that point.\n\nGlad you got it working.  As said in a previous post, I would still be prepared for future issues.  A copy of any credentials and settings from your landlord, a downloaded copy of your router's manual, and ability to login locally.   If you don't have a login and pass to log in locally, you can do a full reset on the router to get that access.  BUT, you will need to input those credentials and settings again.  It wipes all user input when you fully reset it/restore to factory settings.",
      "For everyone helping. It sounds like the apartment complex pays for internet service and provides it to the tenants. Therefore she won't have a modem. The complex routes one Ethernet cable to each apartment from their switch that is setup. \n\nIf you have an Ethernet cable and if you have a not so new laptop, then you should be able to plug the cable directly into the wall and then into your computer. That would at least get you internet for now. \n\nIf not, then it's going to be tough to troubleshoot without seeing the interface and setting up the router. Usually all that needs to happen is the router needs to be rebooted and it should connect fine. But there might be an issue with the connection where ever the switch is setup in the complex. A lot of times apartment complexes that do this would hire a third party to set it up. You might be able to ask the landlord if they can contact that company to help as well. \n\nI'm sorry I'm not able to help a whole lot... ",

      "Short answer? None. One headphone splitter is enough to distort the sound. How many splits you could achieve would depend on the source, and the impedance of your headphones. You could probably get away with multiple splits if they were low impedance ear buds. I'd be wary of even one split with high impedance cans.\n\nReal talk: if you needed some kind of simple/cheap broadcast solution (museum exhibit, etc) you could build a small FM transmitter and use dollar store radios, which would obviously sound shittier than even a dozen daisy chained 3.5mm splitters, or use something like Shoutcast or some other form of internet MP3 streaming.\n\nThere's probably some kind of headphone amp out there with multiple outputs. Dunno how many they'd get to before it became stupid expensive. If you had a line-level signal, you could technically use a bunch of splitters and feed the output to multiple headphone amps.",
      "There\u2019s multi-splitters on the market already as far as I know, I remember one distinctly turning one jack into either 5 or 7",
      "Presumably the first issue you'd hit is impedance. Say your pair of headphones has an impedance of 16 ohms, adding a splitter and a second pair makes the impedance 8 ohms. A third pair would make the impedance 5.3 ohms, whilst a fourth would take us down to 4 ohms, with each pair of headphones sharing 1/4 of the total wattage of the amp.\n\n4 ohms is enough to damage a lot of amps. I believe most phone amps are around 4.5 ohms minimum.",

Does it need to maintain a high audio quality (music or a movie) or does it just need to be understandable. Do you have a budget to pull this off? What equipment will you be transmitting from? (PC, cell phone) and are you using whatever heaphones each of you have? That might give you radically different volumes depending on impedance and type of headphone.\n\nDo you need to move or are you staying in one place?\n\nAnyway the more details we have the better answers you will get.",

Don't really know much about the tiny amps used for headphones but in a solid state amp driving speakers it's not a friendly thing to do to an amp.

Even if chances are it being a macro is high, I preferred wiping my PC as I was never able to pinpoint where it came from or what caused it. Even if i ultimately think its most likely a keyboard/macro issue). \nSome people also mentioned it maybe being a BF4 server issue.

I'm 90% sure that this was simply a bug with NVIDIA, perhaps BF4's anticheat and your keyboard. \n\nGet a network monitoring program and check your ports / programs accessing those ports. GlassWire is one that'll do for now.\n\nI'd also suggest opening Task Manager and closing *everything* that isn't Windows related. As much as you can. \n\nThen go into start-up, check that and make sure nothing you don't recognise is there. You could get \"Autoruns64\" to check that in more detail.\n\nI'd also then propose uninstalling all remote connection programs like TeamViewer, resetting settings for Remote Desktop Connection (built into Windows) and generally just cleaning up your programs list. Manually go through things like your Temp folder in AppData/Local and Program Files too. Delete it if you don't know what it is. \n\nI gotta say, this could be a BF4 bug. \"deah but now i might not be able ti do much :_\" sounds kinda like \"I'm dead so now I'm probably not going to be able to do much :-)\" or something similar that'd be said in BF4 server chat. It's probably nothing, but do the above just to be sure. \n\nIf you wanna be extra careful, try uninstall BF4, find its install location, deleting any remaining files and then reinstalling. Also, reinstall BattleEye / PunkBuster / whatever their anti-cheat is just in case its a memory error with that or something.\n\nAMR admin could also be a BF4 server command issued by an admin. Sounds likely that your server's chatlog was copied, even commands that shouldn't be issued to you. Could even be a vulnerability within BF4 itself - might be worth getting DICE's or EA's attention.\n\nEDIT: You mention it tabbed back into the game and connected to the server, etc. Was it literally using ALT+TAB and cycling through windows or was it more you clicked off the game and the window reappeared? Also, were the inputs 'humanlike' or were they done with a keyboard and not moving the mouse cursor? If the latter, it sounds undeniably like a bug with some software or a stuck key. NVIDIA's overlay is pretty retarded in that sense as it can fuck with keystrokes and interrupt when you lifted your finger off them, can queue them up or just make them get stuck on."

    "post": "This thread has gotten a lot of posts asking about what the virus actually is, how can I detect or remedy it and so on. As such, I've decided to write a less story-like explanation here to clear things up.\n\n#Description\nUpdate: Most detailed description and analysis on this forum (http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/577313/locker-ransomware-hides-until-midnight-on-may-25th-and-then-encrypts-your-data/)    \n\n\nThe Locker virus version X.XX (it takes on a random number with 2 decimal places) is represented in this picture (http://imgur.com/yjgseor). It is a ransomware that encrypts picture and Microsoft Office files, although it does not cover all extensions (for example, .jpg will be encrypted but .JPG will not). \n\nThe virus is known to be on a fuse, so any file downloaded within the past week/month could be a likely culprit. As it stands, there seem to be trends in users of Chrome, TeamExtreme cracked Minecraft, and sports streaming sites, although **none have been truly confirmed**.\n\nIt first activated at 25/5, **midnight by the local clock**. It is not known if it's configured to only trigger on 25/5 yet. A service called **ldr.exe** and a program called **rkcl.exe** will run promptly at midnight, which will encrypt the files and lock them. The program will then pop up informing the user they have 72 hours to make a 0.1BTC payment to save their files.\n\nThe ransomware is also known to disable certain system features like system restore, delete shadow copies, and prevent the uninstalling of software. This makes it incredibly difficult to remove it or roll back to solve the issue.\n\n#Detection\nIf you are unsure of whether you have the Locker virus, check the **ProgramData** folder (Default: C\\ProgramData). The ransomware is known to create the folders **rkcl, tor, steg, and Digger**. steg is known to be created prior to activation and is probably the best bet for detection.\n\nIf you think you might have been infected already, browse through your documents and sort by recently modified, any file that has been modified at midnight (or a bunch of files all modified at the same time) should set off a red flag. Open these files to check for encryption/corruption.\n\n#Prevention\nIf you suspect you have the Locker virus, your best bet is to immediately make a **manual backup** of your files through an external hard drive. Cloud backups work too, although you should turn off the sync function to prevent the corrupted files from replacing the good ones, should the infection happen.\n\n#Solution\nUpdate: As anti-malware software updates, it might be possible to remove the infection using something like Malwarebytes. Removing the infection **does not decrypt the files** though. I will continue monitoring the situation.\n\nUnfortunately, in a similar line to most Cryptoblocker ransomware, there is no surefire way of being able to remove the infection and reverse the encryption effect. Here are some solutions you can try:\n\n1. Use an anti-malware software such as Malwarebytes to attempt to remove the ransomware.\n2. Nuke and pave. Reformat your hard drive and reinstall Windows. This is a surefire way to get rid of the trojan. Once Windows is reinstalled, restore your manual backup.    \n3. Pay the ransom. At least one confirmed case of decryption after payment, but do not take it as a 100% guarantee. Still an option if you have very important files you wish to save, and no backups.\n4. Use a program like Shadow Explorer or Torrent Unlocker to try to restore your files. However, the ransomware is known to delete shadow copies, so this option has been used with limited success.\n5. Do option 2 but save the encrypted files somewhere in the hope that someone will create a tool to decrypt them, but this is also unlikely.\n    \n#Last Words\n**TL;DR**: new ransomware virus (rkcl.exe) activates at 25/5 midnight like cinderella, sits in the programdata folder and encrypts your documents and images and demands payment. best current solution is to wipe and reinstall windows, and restore from manual backup.\n\nI will be continuing to update this thread with developments on probable causes and solutions. Hope this helps, and thanks to the community for your contributions.\n\n#Original Post\n>hi reddit. so i've gotten a encryption+extortion virus on my computer as shown in the picture above. the entire program was created and run at 00:00, 25-5-2015 (system time, GMT+8). more details of my work so far below.\n\n>did some rudimentary research on my own. while the virus is pretty sophisticated, it did a pretty bad job of hitting my important files, and whatever is important is stored on the cloud so i've paused all syncing while i recover those files through google/dropbox/onedrive etc. it did, however, disable system restore, so that is not an option.\n\n>in the meanwhile, running antivirus does not help, but i have managed to trace the task to the C:\\ProgramData folder. Some suspicious activity there. Firstly, the Locker program was traced to a folder within %PROGRAMDATA% called rkcl.exe, in which contained several data files (picture of folder: http://imgur.com/KU1NN07). rkcl.exe is the program that intrudes my screen, and ldr.exe seems to be a service that runs itself automatically. \n\n>more folders in %PROGRAMDATA% that raise flags: folders named tor, steg, and digger were created either on 25/5 or a few days prior to that.\n\n>opening the data files yielded certain information already accessible through the Locker program itself, but data.aa7 contained a string as below:\n\n><RSAKeyValue><Modulus>*some stuff here (not sure if sensitive)*</Modulus><Exponent>AQAB</Exponent></RSAKeyValue>\n\n>i am not sure if this is of any significance, though it seems to be cryptography-related.\n\n>i'm not exactly sure what to do now. i have a feeling the chance of getting the files restored is low, to which i don't particularly mind as most of it is on the cloud. i do wish to be rid of this software at the very least though. any suggestions on what my next step should be? thanks!\n\n>System Specs:\nCustom Laptop running Windows 8.1 Pro Build 9600    \nProcessor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4700MQ CPU @ 2.40GHz, 2401 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)    \nGraphics Card: Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780M    \nInstalled Physical Memory (RAM): 8.00 GB    \n    \n>**EDIT**: i've wiped my computer and reinstalled, so that should clear the ransomware. in the meanwhile, i will continue to monitor the thread and provide updates should any developments arise in dealing with this.\n\n>for now, the ransomware does seem new, so the solution would be to **reinstall windows and restore from a backup**(nuke and pave). if the files are very important, you could try **paying the ransom, but with no guarantee it will actually be restored.**\n\n>we've also deduced that the software was likely embedded in the computer by accessing a malicious website (highly unlikely to be a downloaded file) up to a week before 25/5, and activated by the local clock hitting midnight. the files can be traced mostly to the ProgramData folder (see above for locations), although it could be hiding elsewhere too.\n\n>**EDIT 2**: there's still a lot of speculation to what the source could be, most likely due to the delayed fuse in the ransomware itself. so far, some similarities found include cracked minecraft, Chrome, and sports streaming. all three purported sources have people claiming to have never touched them, though.",

    "post": "So this is something that happened with me while trying to fix the ethernet problems on my board from the gigabyte official service center.\n\nSince the last 1 - 2 weeks the ethernet connection on my PC was giving problems where it would suddenly stop working after an hour or so of using the PC. After some trial and error I was able to conclude that it was a hardware problem and not something to do with the OS/drivers.\n\nSo I went to the gigabyte service center and submitted my board to get it repaired. My board was out of warranty so I had to pay a service charge and later on some additional repair charges for any extra components needed further. That was fine with me.\n\nAfter a few days they call me and say that the board has some \"issues\" and they tried their best to fix it but could not. They told me that the board is having problems with display and is also not booting.\n\nThis was shocking to me. I had never faced such booting/display issues in the entire 3 and half years of using it. All I was having was some problems with the ethernet connection, nothing else. In the worst case scenario my plan was to buy an additional Wifi card and use the board as usual. I had no idea that trying to fix it would render the entire board dead!\n\nSo my question is, is this something normal? Since the ethernet and display/booting issues do not seem to be related at all! Also, they had checked the entire board before repairing it and this issue was not present at the time. It was only after the repairs that this issue started occurring. Do they owe me something here since this seems to be entirely their fault?",

Other than that they only thing you can really do is give them a bad review but even with that there is a chance that they didn't do anything wrong and the board was just getting worse and worse resulting in them seeing these additional problems",

It was insanely good service. I'm sorry to hear you're having such a bad experience! ",

You could have spent $20 for a PCIe Ethernet card but now have to spend +$150 for a new mobo. \n\n> Also, they had checked the entire board before repairing it and this issue was not present at the time. It was only after the repairs that this issue started occurring.\n\nIf you have this in writing then its all you need. They can be assholes and claim part X is related to part Y that controls the boot process but fixing a bad ethernet port should never turn into a dead mobo.\n\nStart with Twitter and Facebook. Say flat-out that they killed a working board that only had a bad ethernet connection and now you have to spent +$150 to buy a new mobo instead of a $20 ethernet card.\n\nThis does happen all the time with almost every manufacturer. I can tell you a sob story about sending in an ASUS monitor for repairs and it comes backs with the bezels cracked and spending months getting a new monitor out of them. \n\nI specifically use gigabyte mobos due to their reliability. I have built a few hundred computers and they are the most reliable."

Whatever happened here must be an extremely rare event, such that if Malwarebytes and Defender didn't pick up any infections, then I think backing up and reinstalling is the safest bet to ensure data security.\n\nFWIW I've used Cheat Engine and don't recall it ever changing my cursor, but iunno.

      "Nothing's going to be done.  I'm a networking admin--I have to deal with Microsoft on a couple levels.  Had the displeasure of trying to go through them for personal support on products like Office and Windows phones.\n\nI typically get a feel for how a company is structured as this happens.  Some companies are engineered in a way that customer support is connected: I've dealt with Apple before and their rep can take a ticket to the actual IOS engineers and get an answer.\n\nBeing an employee with Microsoft means coming in every day, sitting in your cubicle and not knowing what your job is, what anyone else is doing and hoping nobody notices _you don't know how to do anything_.  They're compartmentalized from other divisions and can't get info or pass issues to anyone who matters.  These guys are literally the dumbest of the dumb, but that's what happens when you outsource to India and probably pay shit wages.\n\nIt actually terrifies me from a security standpoint how their first response to everything is trying to remote into people's systems.  Last time I had to deal with them was over a Hotmail account, and got the usual speech about how she needed to remote in.  I don't allow them access, ever, and they act like it's insane that I went off script and said \"no\".\n\nShe tried to direct me to run msconfig, at which point I stop her and say \"That has nothing to do with anything.  _I know_ what msconfig does; I don't think _you_ know what it does.\"  If I had allowed her remote, she was going to play with my boot settings over an account issue?  Seriously?\n\nI got one of those calls the other day from the scam that cold calls people purporting to be from Microsoft.  It's no wonder this has been so successful because they're doing the same thing Microsoft does.  Same way MS needed to push Win10 to everyone and took up crapware tactics to do it.  We try to educate people to beware these flags and MS comes along and emulates them.\n\nHalf my job is security in computers and internet.  I tell everyone: when they ask to remote in, DO NOT ALLOW IT.  Require their tech instruct you on how to enter the commands so you can be the firewall against something that might harm you.  This stranger's only authority is they receive a paycheck from a mega corporation and I strongly advise against trusting them because of it.  Do you think Microsoft would ever accept accountability if their low level employee causes a larger issue either maliciously or through incompetence?\n\nBut again, that's how they've structured it.  Nobody in the company has to take responsibility for anything.  You'll never talk to anyone who matters.  There's nobody to report to and no accountability for employees.  They're the perfect example of a company that only relates to the rest of the world through metrics.  I've banged my head against that wall trying to get product and software support.  Even when your enterprise has a fucking contract through Microsoft, they all have shit-for-brains.",
      "The disconcerting thing about outsourced \"tech support\" is that the staff are just impoverished people working jobs that nobody else wants for crap pay.\n\nThe discussion on whether the callers are legitimate is kind of moot since a lot of these people are likely working more than one job, both legitimate and illegitimate.\n\nClock off from your job as a \"genuine\" Microsoft tech support member and head on over to your job doing scam calls. It's all just call centre work to put food on the table.\n\nThe most disconcerting thing about this scenario which I suspect is all too common is information overlap.

      "The only way he could read what's on your screen is if he's using a remote access tool or keylogger. This is more complicated than just connecting to your Wi-Fi, he would need to install something on your computer. Even if he's on your network he can't just install something remotely on your system, he would need to know your admin password or exploit an unknown vulnerability in Windows 7 to remotely install a remote access tool.\n\nFirst off, do not confront him because he will deny it.\n\nHere's what I'd like you to try. Next time you hear him reading things on your screen open up notepad and type in that you know he's reading what's on your screen and listen to his reaction. If he just keeps on reading I'm inclined to believe there's something else going on here.\n\nI want to cover everything and not leave any possibility left uninvestigated. These next steps involve environmental possibilities. Normally I would not suggest these but I have a gut feeling and don't want to feel like I left anything out.\n\nDo you have a friend that can listen to what your neighbor is saying and confirm they hear the same thing? If you don't have a friend to listen, do you have a way to record sound and let us hear what he's saying? If you're not comfortable making a recording that's understandable.\n\nI know this next thing has kind of turned into a joke, but there's a possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning. There's a popular /r/legaladvice thread where somebody thought their landlord was breaking in and leaving behind notes, but they were actually suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning. If you don't have a carbon monoxide detector you need to get one, it's just as important as a smoke detector so you should always have one regardless.",

The latter being much more difficult, as explained elsewhere in this thread: there would have to be an unpatched vulnerability in your OS and he would have to know about it. If your OS has automatic updates enabled I dare say it\u2019s practically impossible. \n\nIt also seems unlikely that, in addition to being a highly skilled hacker, your neighbor would have the motivation to spy on you.

There is nothing you can do or say that will get through.\n\n* The best thing I can suggest is that  somehow, some way, **stop her from having a credit card on the net**. That might mean that you maintain all her accounts, like Netflix and any other service.\n* The next thing I would do is **create a fresh image backup of her system**, using something like Macrium Reflect. Don't use anything Mac based like Time Machine, because she will find a way to screw it up. Believe me. That way, you have a way back and you can reload it at will.\n* If she uses gmail or an apple email account, have it **forward a copy of all mail to an account that you have access to**. This may be an intermediate step to just taking over control of her email account.\n* **MFA that she controls is a waste of time because she will approve everything**. When using MFA, use \\*your\\* email/phone/account as the key. Then she won't be able to approve the request on her own. Lot's of maintenance, but there is no other way.\n* **Isolate her system from the rest of the network** through the use of an Internet Only Guest SSID on her wifi router and then enforce a VPN by having it autoload on startup and use cloudflare ([1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) and [1.0.0.1](https://1.0.0.1)) for DNS. This is to protect everyone else from her.\n* I have no idea how old the person in question is. **There may be a time where you have to \"take the keys away\"** from her to protect her. That would mean dropping down to a feature phone ( not a smartphone) and cancelling internet service to the house.\n\nWhat I have described sounds a lot like steps one would take with a person is slowly developing cognition problems as they age. That's because that's exactly what I am saying. In regards to computers and phones, she might be.\n\n*There have been times in my career that I have pulled computers from people's desks because they just couldn't use them at all.

From the information at hand, I don't think she could be vigilant enough in this cruel world to maintain a level of security that she needs.\n\n***This person could just be too nice*** for the rough and tumble of the Internet. **I like that.** Over the years, I have run across this type of person, and I changed up their systems and procedures as much as I could to let them both do the work they needed to get done and keep that wonderful innocence.\n\n**Let's face it, I'm an old tech curmudgeon.** That's who I am, and what I did professionally. ***But, my goal in that was to let other people NOT have to become like me.***\n\nSo, if you are in any kind of support role, especially for loved ones, keep that in mind.",

      "Hmm. I work for a small-medium sized university in IT (I'm also a student there, but I have my sysadmin hat on right now). In general we don't block HTTP/S, etc traffic.\nHowever, we do block/throttle traffic such as BitTorrent, etc (Well, not right now, as our packet shaper is acting up). \n\nFor those of you students out there, **please understand the reasoning**: We receive **tons** of copyright claims for BitTorrent media, mainly because BitTorrent freely exposes any IP to anyone who is in the pool. When you torrent on university networks, this IP is linked back to the university, which copyright enforcement companies (the big media corps hire other companies to monitor this). There's also the issue that BitTorrent uses **significantly** more bandwidth than other sources, which can cause issues for everyone else attempting to use the shared resource of the university.\n\nAs for keeping the network running, well, we're people too. Most of the people I work with have families that need their time too, but even so they pull way more hours than is normally expected for the job. We're also (and I suspect, like many universities) severely understaffed, so there's about 5 of us (including me, and I'm not even a full time employee) that manage the network for >4000 people. We can't be there all the time.\n\ntldr; We have to because too many people use BitTorrent for piracy, and BitTorrent uses way more bandwidth. ",

When Bypassing security, not only are the techs and subreddit facing potential liability issues, but a good network administrator can often tell if a computer is bypassing. It may seem ridiculous, and I can't voice my opinion on it, but some colleges will press serious consequences on students/faculty that do something even as simple as forwarding through ports you shouldn't be to bypass upload/download speed caps.

If they are nowhere near advertised speeds, then you need a better WiFi router.\n\nIf your ISP is providing your WiFi router, demand a competent router. If you\u2019re the one providing your own router, you\u2019ll probably need to get a better router. \n\nWhile expensive, mesh routers are by far the best choice you can make when it comes to WiFi routers.\n\nEver since I upgraded my routers at home to one of those mesh routers, I\u2019ve not had speed issues.\n\nMy wired speed reaches 240-260 (measured on the router hooked to the modem itself). Well above my \u201cadvertised\u201d speed of 200. \n\nMost of my testable devices are measuring around 180-200 over WiFi.\n\nMesh tech is often pricey, but if you\u2019re wanting to increase the reliability of your WiFi connections, it\u2019s pretty much the only way to go.\n\nMy 2\u00a2",

Could also be heavy traffic on that wifi channel too. Connected to 2.4 band or 5ghz band? I'm betting you're on the 2.4 band, and that'd be the problem.",
      "25Mbps-35Mbps on a Wireless N Connection is fairly common (1200 Mbps would be a High End N connection, or a really low end AC connection), even if you have Gigabit internet, you will see these speeds. Need Wireless AC, and a decent AC1900-AC2400 at min to start seeing over 100Mb/s wireless. So Check to make sure you are on the 5ghz network, and not the 2.4ghz, and make sure your Router supports 5ghz AC, and that your wireless device (phone, laptop, tv, etc) support 5ghz AC as well.",
      "Are you using the included modem/router/switch? This can often bottleneck your network speeds. If this is the case, you have a few options. You could request a new modem/router/switch from Xfinity or you could purchase your own router. I recommend purchasing a router as you own it instead of renting one from your ISP, just make sure it supports your desired speeds.\n\nAnother possible solution, though unlikely, would be your patch cables. Cat5 cables support 100 Mbps, Cat5e supports 1 Gbps, and Cat6 supports 10 Gbps. Cat5e is fine for most home networks but its it's worth it to check to make sure a bad cable isn't the cause of your problems.",

      "> I just switched to a new internet plan which is now getting me **UP TO** 400 mbps download speed.\n\nThis is part of the problem. If you have an actual agreement to get 400Mbps guaranteed, you can troubleshoot with the ISp for best results. ISP also prioritize burst speeds to known speed-testing sites to make it look like you're getting great speeds, when you really aren't.\n\nIf you really wanna test your speeds, trying pull via FTP from something insanely fast like a seedbox so you can eliminate the variable of the source being your limiting factor. You could also try the same thing using a VPN to see if your traffic is being shaped.\n\nAlso, make sure you aren't using wireless while testing.\n\nEDIT: A thorough answer from a certified networking guy gets a downvote?",
      "Keep in mind that your bandwidth  is not guaranteed once it leaves your provider's providers uplink. The link between you and the provider, and the link to the providers uplink  to the greater internet really are all your provider has some control over. Speed test sites have lots of bandwidth available to them, and choosing the one that is geologically closest, or best, will give you great results, but the site you are downloading from maybe not have that same bandwidth and may need to support multiple users are once -vs- using a que. Your route to steam and how busy steam is at the moment, will effect your downloads.  \n\n\nYou look into a tool called IPERF. You can have one person run it on their side, and you run it on yourside. You reverse client/server roles and run the test again. You can get your ISP to run IPERF with you in many instances. You can also run them with people you know who run servers with large pipes.  \n\n\nAnother tool to snag will be MTR portable. THis is a visual active traceroute. You can let you see the route to your destination with real time stats. It can help you see if there is a bottleneck between you and your destination.",
      "Could be a list of reasons for this to be happening.\n\n1. The Steam server might be running a little slow, which could be due to high activity, Maintenance or or their own list of reasons.\n2. The people in your neighborhood could be active at this time, slowing down your connection, I am sure you do not have your own dedicated line as it would be tons of $$$.\n3. Like another comment suggests background processes such as the operating system or any program.\n4. Also what is connected to your router via wired or wireless and using bandwidth.\n5. Location away from the Steam servers could have an impact on your download speed.\n6. ISP's are not under any laws to guarantee download or upload speeds, In fact they can disable your internet and still expect a payment. They could be throttling you, so you call back wanting to pay more for better speeds.\n\nI am sure more can be added to this list, but most of all I hope this gets figured out.",
      "Guess what...  That 400Mbps requires someone on the other side uploading to you at 400Mbps...  Most websites cut you off past a certain point.  Really, anything over about 150Mbps is wasted on a serial connection.  You need P2P or a hosting site that is willing to provide you speeds beyond the \\~125Mbps you're getting now.\n\nThis also requires that you take into account things like traffic manipulation...",
      "Easy 2 questions: Have you run the same test from a direct connection to your modem? (No router involved) and Have you run the same test with a computer that is not the one you describe also being directly connected to the modem?\n\nIf the answer to both is yes, its an ISP problem. 17MB/s sounds like a DOCSIS2 cable connection and not DOCSIS3. If your service was recently upgraded, your modem may need a firmware upgrade or setting change to run faster. \n\nIf the answer is no to either question, do the needful :) and complete both test scenarios.",
      "Seen a lot of similar problems caused by software on the computer, ex. anti-virus scanning the traffic slower then the download.\n\nCould also be due to write speed of the drive you're using (less likely though since most drives can handle 150 MB/sec). \n\nBest way to rule out both is to try a different  device. If you don't have a different device to try you could at least rule out software to some extent by booting into safe-mode with networking and/or a linux live distro.",

In your case it could be hard to pin down. To see if it's the RAM try installing your RAM in two adjacent slots so it runs in single channel. If you see all your RAM then it's fine and it's a memory controller problem.\n\nIf it's a controller problem I'd try updating the BIOS first off.

In those cases the hackers (and anyone with the database) has access to your password for that website.\n\nThis affects you in two ways:\n\n1: On that website.  If they can log in as you and get access to things like your full name, address, parts of your credit card number they can use that to compromise your identity further to steal from you or use you to steal from others.  This is why it's important that hacks are disclosed publicly quickly.\n\n2. On any other website you use that password on.  They're going to try your email + password combo everywhere.  If you used the same password on your account for Bob's Pizza and for your bank account, that may mean someone now has access to your online banking.\n\nThe big takeaway from this - the #1, I'm going to put in big letters rule is:\n\n## NEVER EVER EVER RE-USE PASSWORDS\n\n*ESPECIALLY* bank and email accounts!

What the heck is happening?\n\nUseful info: the set has mic and headphone mini-jacks plus a USB for lights. I don't have the USB plugged in because it's impossible to look at your own head. So just the audio input/output are used. The mic is disabled both via the Windows sound controls and on the physical inline switch. The sounds have only happened so far when no other audio is playing, but I don't know if that's by chance or not. No other electronics active in the room aside from the computer-related things. Never happened with previous headsets. \n\nI hate to repeat myself but what the heck. Can anyone translate these space messages and advise how to respond - or at least suggest what is causing them?",

It's extremely unlikely that a pair of typical headphones would be able to pick up interference from CB or Longwave Radios, or other electronics in your room.

    "post": "Little back story: This is a long standing client of mine who I fix their issues whenever they call me. I have been their IT partner for a number of years now but also work in the IT industry.\n\nThis client calls me up saying that they are having issues with internet connectivity, no biggie right? -  reset a modem, redo a driver or two, 25 minutes tops - Oh how wrong I was, we are on day 2.  I am now here asking the experts as even the ISP has been no help.\n\n\\---\n\nThe issue begins with the computers redirecting all internet traffic to [http://msftconnecttest.com](http://msftconnecttest.com) , and windows saying no internet access.  This is normally indicative of no connection and windows redirecting you to this page to connect to a website. First thing I did was reset the modem (Frontier/Verizon) this did not resolve anything. This did not resolve the problem. Next was to use windows to reset the network settings and drivers on the computers - special note both mac and PC are unable to access the network, but only PC is being redirected here - same thing, nothing working. During this I also disabled msftconnecttest coming up in the registry, yet when attempting to visit any website, the website will \"load\" and the msftconnecttest page will load instead yet the website will look like it will load.\n\nPing test to google resolves to an IP of [172.19.1.254](https://172.19.1.254) which is NOT google's, with a time of less than 1ms, in fact a ping test to ANY website resolves to that IP with a time of less than 1ms. Computers on the network are both wired and wireless and cannot even ping the modem at this point. I call up Frontier and the tech literally says to me that \"The modem has been hacked by Russia\" (I am not kidding, I wish I had the call recorded) and that it would need to be replaced. I got the modem replaced at the local Frontier store and the exact same thing is happening... but here is the kicker - if you turn on a mobile hot spot, the computers work just fine, so this is obviously an ISP issue right?\n\nSo I call up Frontier AGAIN, and get someone else on the line who tells me that they are able to ping the modem and they see internet connectivity and if I want any other service I need to get in touch with Premium IT Support (a paid service... no surprise here).\n\nI am at a loss. Internet works fine off of Frontier and yet Frontier claims there service is working? yeah\\_ok.gif\n\nIf anyone has seen something like this before or could assist it would be greatly appreciated",

The mobile hotspot would be taking authority over the DNS queries and therefore bypassing the rogue. Whether that be a hardware device or a software device requires more investigation, but I would start by figuring out what that address is physically, and pulling the plug on it!",
      "Shot in the dark, but this is something I've seen before: power off your client's debit/credit machines and see if the problem goes away. If not...\n\nNetworking issues are always difficult to troubleshoot, given how many different parts there are involved. Best method to try is process of elimination.\n\nDisconnect everything from the Frontier equipment. Give it a power cycle while you're at it. Power off any devices that use Wi-Fi. Then, connect a known good computer (not your client's) directly to the modem. Does it work? If no, there's a problem with the Frontier equipment or their connection. It's up to them at this point.\n\nIf it does work, replace the known good computer with one of your client's computers. Does it work? If no, there's possibly malware on the computer messing with connectivity.\n\nIf it does work, disconnect it and connect the next piece of networking equipment, whether it's a router, a switch, whatever. Repeat the above tests with the known good computer, and the client's computer, one at a time. Have them both connected at the same time. Connect and test your client's computers, one at a time, until they're all connected and working, or you find the one causing the network to break down. Reconnect Wi-Fi devices, one at a time, until they're all connected and working, or you find the one causing the network to break down. Keep going, adding one device at a time, until you find the culprit (or it all miraculously works, in which case proceed to pull out your hair.)",
      "So while it sounds more likely that the router etc. is the issue and that is a good road to go down, I ran into an issue last year where one day I came into the office and nobody could get online. Similar issue as you describe, couldn't ping stuff, kept coming back to Microsoft default IP's etc.  Long story short, it ended up being that after an update we had our firewall handing out DHCP, as well as one of our VM's on the same network.  Other than the update, I'm not at all sure how it happened, but once we disabled DHCP from the firewall, and allowed our server to handle it as it was supposed to be doing, everything went back to normal.  We didn't however, figure that out immediately.",

    "post": "So, the SSD i bought on black friday arrived this morning at my house and i decided that tas i was already opening my PC up i'd go ahead and also change the thermal paste.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd so i did, i had to use some force removing the heatsink but ok, changed the paste and plugged the SSD in. I had some problems getting the heatsink back in again but nothing serious i think. Plugged the computer back into the power and, nothing. The computer turned on but i didn't get any image on screen. Not even from the bios.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo i reinstalled the heatsink and removed the SSD, still no dice. This time the heatsink was well placed so i moved on from there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI removed the heatsink and removed the processor from the socket and put it back again. To do this i removed one of my RAM sticks that was a bit too close. I plugged my SSD again and, the computer worked, kind of. I was able to get into the bios and everything seemed correct, but i forgot to reinstall the RAM stick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, to my surprise, putting the RAM back in made the computer not work again. It won't even get to the bios with the RAM in. The RAM that had nothing to do with anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust to be sure, i removed it again and, voal\u00e1, it's working fine without the RAM stick. I can get to windows normally and everything.\n\nDid i just randomly fucked up this stick? Wouldn't i at least reach the bios if the problem is the memory stick? What could be going on?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT - I'm not getting any signal even without the stick anymore. My best guess is that i somehow fucked up my processor. But the computer did work before. AAHHH\n\nEDIT2 - Figured out the problem is with the slot. Having any one of my two sticks in the other slot let's the computer run fine. I'll try cleaning it up, perhaps me removing the dust made this problem.\n\nEDIT3 - The computer is running 20/20 when i don't use that slot, cleaning up didn't work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT4 - SO, i've been fiddling with the pins on the CPU slot for more than an hour, this feels like doing surgery on a tiny robot, i had 2 obvious problem spots, one pin in the right bent all the way back that was not that hard to pull back again to the right way, and a bunch of pins a bit above that seemed to be a little bit \"wrong\", so i went to town in them.\n\nI wasn't sure exactly how right they need to be, so i'd try until they felt better than before and then tried to turn the computer on. I did that 3 times. By now i don't think i can get them any better than they currently are and i'm still having the same problem. Here's a picture of their state.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/474E8SR](https://imgur.com/a/474E8SR)\n\nI just noticed in this picture that there's another weird pin, so i'll look at it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT5 - All the pins are facing the right way and with the small pointy part up, they are not all perfect straight and there is one that looks a little bent and beaten but it is facing the right way. I think i'm done with this. I don't think i can keep doing this, i'll take it to the shop tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFINAL EDIT - So, i wasn't able in the end to 100% fix the pins and in the end i think i might have caused even more damage. I decided for a new MOBO and also a new processor, it wasn't cheap but i guess that's life. I'm mad at me for doing this shit but i learned my lesson.\n\nA lot of people seems to not know why i was changing my thermal paste. I was sure changing the paste at least once every year was standard practice, that's how i learned to do it when i first started messing with computers 15 years ago and i really didn't know you're not supposed to do it anymore.

      "As other people have stated what model of Document camera are you using. But we should go one step further. How is your equipment set up and what other equipment do you have access to in your classroom? I work in IT for a school district that uses various models of document cameras, computers, projectors, smart and not smart TV's, etc. Not knowing what is connected to what and why can make finding a viable solution difficult.\n\nMost document cameras shouldn't need to be hooked up to a computer in order to work. Granted there may be some models that will only work if they are connected to a computer. Many of the ones we use in our district have VGA OUT/IN and/or HDMI OUT that is then hooked up to a projector or TV. The only times I've seen teachers hook the document camera to their computer and use the software is wholly dependant on how their room is set up.\n\nThere are a few teachers in my district who either didn't want their computer to be anywhere near the VGA & HDMI connections in the wall. Or they didn't have enough room in their classroom for the optimal document camera setup. So using the document camera software, the document camera, and a wireless connection via an AppleTV connected to the projector works best for them. There are even teachers who don't use the district provided document camera.\n\nIt seems odd to me that you have to use your room budget to purchase technology that should be provided by the district. But I know not every school district works the same as the one I work for.\n\nIn my opinion, you should start going up the chain. Find out if your district has a Director of Technology and talk with them, or talk with your building's principal. Have a conversation with the school board members and the superintendent at the next school board meeting. Try and find out if other teachers are having the same issue as you are and see if and how they fixed the problem.",

The camera has a VGA pass thru as well as an HDMI output. One of those should work for your projector connection.\n\nLastly, there is a plugin that will let you use a webcam as a document camera through VLC. The document camera you have is supposed to work as a generic camera too so it should work. I have had a few teachers go that route in the past, back before they all had Elmos and Ladibugs.

      "Contrary to what the other commentors think, there is no such thing as a stupid question, and your question is far from stupid. I'll try to the best of my ability to answer it adequately.\n\nEXE's and DLL's contain x86 machine code. I'll call them executables or binaries from here on. The only notepad++ readable info they contain is the strings (basically solid unchanging pieces of text that the program may want to show on screen at some point. A good example would be anything that appears in the about dialog of a program, like the creator, a copyright notice, etc.), which are located somewhere within the binary.\n\nTry a hex editor like HxD or a Resource Viewer like ResHacker if you want to see some useful data. Also, if you're looking to change strings or data in these files, make sure they retain the same length as the original data. Otherwise, you'll mess up the formatting of the binary and the CPU will try to execute non-executable data. That is bad.\n\nGhidra is also incredibly useful, so much so that I'll give it a whole paragraph or so. Ghidra can break apart all sorts of binaries into uncompiled C, but it's quite a PITA to set up and use. Not to mention reverse engineering is a painfully boring and slow process where 90% of the work you do is renaming variables. Also, it is illegal to use Ghidra on software that is licensed in a way that disallows reverse engineering, although this is generally unenforceable unless you are profiting or circumventing copyright laws. Despite it's flaws, it's absolutely worth learning and reverse engineering looks very good on a resume, especially when you are targeting a cyber security or comp sci career.\n\nLmk if you have any questions.",

A lot of hacks that are applied to compiled executables are really simple things like changing something to a 0 to skip a certain execution branch, and thus disable something or bypass some operation.\n\nThere are tools called decompilers, which attempt to take compiled software and return it to readable sourcecode form, but it is an inexact art, since some of the source content is lost completely (such as meaningful file/function names, often they are converted to numbers or gibberish), and the compiler may make changes and optimizations that result in assembly code with absolutely no sane equivalent in sourcecode.",

The more crafty spammers do use the link to confirm email addresses.\n\nContemporary spam servers use a \"send & forget\" system that really doesn't care what happens to the email after it is sent. Any sort of tracking mechanisms can also lead investigators back to the source so the larger spam facilities don't embed anything useful in the message.\n\nYou can still adjust your Hotmail settings to whitelist anyone in your addressbook.

I've tried to reach these \"real\" people and all it has done is increase the volume of robocalls I receive 3-5x. It is never worth it.

I use this service to register to websites I don't know or for one time things, like when I want to download something and the website asks me to register I use a temporary email since it's a one time thing, or when I want to try something like when I wanted to try Instagram I used a temporary email because if I didn't like it I could just forget it exists.\n- I started going into the advanced option when a website asks me to accept cookies (and I disable tracking and other stuff)\n- I started unckecking the boxes to track and send emails on companies that are GDPR compliant as they need to ask you to accept them when you register, for non-gdpr complaiants, I usually click on my profile and I search for those email options and I disable them all.\n\n\nDoing this my inbox, being the real or the alias, is free from spam for 3 years already.\n\n\n\nNOTE: take care with what email clients you register to create your email as the company itself sends you spam email, one company I can think of is Google, based on adsense Google itself will send you spam emails, like Google there are other companies, just search online for those companies and avoid them."

You may want to get a business class one meant for small businesses. And if it was me I'd set bandwith limits to the devices on a subnet set up just for the gaming areas.\n\nAs far as ports, you could just run one or two lines to wall jacks, and then plug a network switch in and have a bunch of lan cables of good lengths ready to plug in as needed. Good excuse to buy a spool of cat6 and a good crimper as well as a jacket stripper, assuming you don't already have one. And not getting the cheapest rj45 connectors will be something you won't regret. Good ones can be easier to crimp, as well as more reliable when being hooked/unhooked frequently.",

The fact the audio loops is very suspicious. Id hang up right away.",
      "They way I understand it, robo-callers (machines/computers connected to a building's phone system) dial dozens, if not hundreds, of numbers a minute, sometimes from a list, but also sometimes sequentially in order to hit every single phone number in a range of numbers. \n\nWhen a call is actually answered, the machine listens for a distinctive speech pattern. If it hears something like a full sentence and a beep it knows it reached a voicemail box, and usually hangs up, but marks the number for redial later. If the machine hears a \"hello\" followed by a silent pause, it assumes there is a human answering, then it redirects the call to a bank of phones in the building manned by the staff. If no staff picks up the call right away, it just keeps the call on hold till a staff member picks up. This is why you see a lot of people say \"i got a call from this random number and there was no one there\". Its just that the staff were busy talking to other people and couldn't get to you fast enough. Sometimes you answer and say \"hello\", and get a long silent pause, then just as you are about to hang up, someone will come on the line and start talking to you. Again, this is due to the sheer number of calls being placed versus how many staff are available to take connected calls. Some robo-callers have the ability for staff to send a pre-recorded message to the human who picks up the phone if there isn't a staff member available. \n\nIn this case, it sounds like the call was machine-dialed, answered by a human, routed by the machine to a staff member's phone line that was not on a call, answered by accident, and you heard a background conversation accidentally recorded by the staff nearby. I wouldn't worry about it.\n\nI don't answer any calls if they are not in my contacts list for this specific reason. If you answer random calls, your number gets added to a list by the robo-caller. That list, even if the business is legit (like a real charity or political workers) can be sold and passed around to other businesses. If the business is not legit, your number will definitely get sold to other scammers. If the call is legit, and its important enough, they can leave me a voicemail.\n\nAnswer one call from a scammer, and expect a flood of them for the next month or three.",

    "post": "I bought a Lenovo (model U530) laptop from Best Buy for $900. At the beginning of December, we brought the laptop to Geek Squad because it had a failing hinge that kept it from closing properly. It's a frequently reported problem with this model of Lenovo.\nA Geek Squad technician examined the laptop. Other than the hinge problem, everything worked fine, and all of the laptop's parts were intact. He sent out the laptop for repair and said it would probably be covered by the warranty. He also said further damage might occur to the hinge because they would have shut the laptop. Understandable.\nA few days later we were informed by Geek Squad that the repair wouldn't be covered by warranty and would cost over $700 to repair. We said \"No thanks\" since that's almost what the laptop cost, and we planned to take it to another repair shop to get an estimate if the warranty wouldn't cover hinge repair. (Though, why wouldn't it?)\nA week later, we picked up the laptop from Best Buy. The screen is cracked, a piece of plastic is removed and affixed to the lid with masking tape, wires are exposed, and the hinges have been unscrewed so as to separate the lid from the base nearly entirely. It will power on, but can't get past the main screen. The crack creates phantom touches and renders the touch screen useless. The touchpad no longer works. The keyboard works sporadically. In other words, an inconvenient but functional laptop is now completely non-functional.\nThe Geek Squad manager says Best Buy can't be held accountable because the damage occurred solely from closing the lid, which I gave permission for them to do. This obviously isn't the case. The laptop was tampered with, likely resulting in the cracked screen. How are pieces unscrewed from closing and opening a lid?\nThe store manager offered me $150 towards a new laptop. Sorry, but that wasn't going to cut it. He said the only thing I could do was call 1-888-BESTBUY (the customer service number). We did. They said we should contact the store manager. They refused to allow us to open a claim or direct us to the appropriate forms. Best Buy's twitter account has informed me they do not exist. The store manager wouldn't give us the phone number of the district manager to pursue things further.\n\nWhat should I do??\n\nEdited to include photo links:\nhttp://m.imgur.com/cnnIfmL\nhttp://m.imgur.com/rNPApWW\nhttp://m.imgur.com/96TuSm8",

Your best course of action is to again call 1-888-bestbuy and inform them that the store manager has been uncooperative in assisting you.  **Insist on escalating the issue with them**.  Unfortunately with issues like this the store response really breaks down to the guy at the top of the store until corporate comes rolling in.",
      "In addition to everyon else's advice, never use the geek squad again and never get any kind of warranty from best buy. Beyond putting a product in your hands, they can't do anything right and even selling you something tends to be pretty challenging for them.",
      "Current geek squad agent here. You're getting a lot of horrible information. Basically you need to check your service order claim sheet and check the appearance section. This is what you signed off your laptop looked like prior to sending it to the service center. If there is any variation the service center absolutely has to note it in the system or they could be held liable for damage during shipping. Your best bet is calling the physical corporate building and discussing these discrepancies. The decision on the hinge repair is up to your manufacturer. Best buy does not warranty these products and follows manufacturer guidelines for repairs. If you had purchased a protection plan from best buy the company itself would have covered it. However corporate may help you out due to what seems to be shipping damage. ",
      "Best Buy once tried to not honor an extended warranty on a failed plasma TV for me.. I made a stink on twitter to @bestbuy and was able to get a regional manager to call me, apologize, and honor my warranty.",
      "This is why you take pictures of everything. It takes next to no time and can save you so much headache.\n\nBut since it's too late for that, you need to contact Best Buy corporate. Write a succinct and concise letter, an actual letter, and mirror that via email, saving all your communication. \n\nTalk to your lawyer dad, he will help you out. Failing that, take it to small claims and get back the full cost of the laptop, they likely wont even challenge such a small amount. I've won claims a few times, but I've had much more luck with corporate and the threat of bad PR.  \n\nEDIT: Just to expound on that a bit, I had issues with Verizon and my bill and the agreed upon terms, my cell phone automatically records all conversations so when there was a discrepancy, I contacted corporate and put the conversation on soundcloud and sent it to them, they immediately fixed it, same thing with Comcast, however it wasn't so immediate.\n\nCapital One gave me shit about some charges on a totally paid off credit card I hadn't used in 5 years, but I left open to help my credit rating. I did the trifecta on my credit score last year (see /r/personalfinance) and formally requested they mail me the outstanding charges. They didn't (or at least I never received it) but kept the collection hounds on my ass, I sued them for time and damages and won. About a month later they called and mailed me saying the charges had been relieved and I never got another call. ",
      "Hola!\n\nI used to be one of the nerds with the puddle jumper pants and the little black ties. \n\nRegarding your situation, if you did not purchase the accidental damage warranty then you are only left with the manufacturer's warranty. Every manufacturer that we dealt with specifically did not cover any physical damage whatsoever. Many of them tried to claim that hinges were part of 'normal wear and tear' and thus not covered.\n\nRegardless, if you had declined the replacement of the screen frame (which contains the hinges, as they don't just replace the hinges) the laptop should have been brought back in one piece, minus whatever damage resulted from having to close the laptop.\n\nI would highly suggest calling 1-888-BEST-BUY and escalating as high as you can. In addition, I'd recommend an executive email carpet bomb, check out 'The Consumerist' for help on this. Even if BBY was technically or legally not at fault, whenever there was attention on it from the higher ups, we'd just send out the laptop/camera/pc to have it fixed at no cost to the customer. Squeaky wheel gets the grease and all that.\n\nLike /u/Lonetrek said, until the crap rolls downhill from corporate to the store manager, the GeekSquad supervisor and store manager will stand by their policy.",
      "Had a power problem on a 6 year old Toshiba laptop that I bought at Best Buy. Since I had a problem I took it to the geek squad to see if they could help. They took it and two weeks later was told I needed a new motherboard which would cost $900 bucks. I said no and took my laptop home. That day I received a mailer about a computer place called Micro Center opening up in Brooklyn only 10 minutes away so I took a shot and brought my laptop there. After signing in the teck took all of 5 minutes to figure out it was part of the power cord (which I had just replaced a month earlier) that connects from the plug into the power converter. He stood there holding the cord long enough to power the battery in the laptop enough to turn on and make sure that was the problem. They had one in stock for $9 bucks on sale for $6 so Micro Center saved me $ 804 dollars.   \nMy advice, follow some of the good posts here and try to be a nice guy about it, at first. If you still have no satisfaction just stand outside the Best Buy with your laptop and a sign stating your problem, what happened and what Best Buy did or more importantly what they didn't do to help you. Bring friends and just be a pain in the ass until you get some satisfaction. Shit, if your in Brooklyn buy me lunch and I'll do it just for fun. And a lunch.",
      "Current repair agent here. Look at your service tag (or call to get it from geek squad again, or go to the store) and look at the \"appearance\" notes. Anything NOT covered there, HAS to be covered by geek squad if they broke it. This would be done in-store, and under store-warranty.  They may send it out, but again, this would be store-charged, and not charged by you.\n\nOr, you can PM me your phone numbers (or service order number) and I can look into the service tag when i work again (saturday) and see if I can escalate it myself.  I may not be able to escalate, but I can surely find you the avenue or person to contact.\n\nThis is very cut and dry if they didnt put \"cracked screen, removed hinge/bezel\" on the paperwork, its theirs to deal with.  I can also find you their district managers phone number / email, and forward it to you.\n\nFurthermore, they didnt \"HAVE\" to close it to shit it.  They could have taken the bezel off, removed the laptop screen and shipped it in two pieces, as to prevent further damage.  They also could have shipped it in a tote/bin to prevent it needing to be shipped the standard way.\n\nTLDR: They fucked up, I can possibly help.\n\nPS: Taking it to court wouldnt work. I have yet to see a store manager in 2.5 years lose a battle in court over small claims like this.  It usually ends up poorly for the client.

      "The Ryzen 2700x does not support quad channel, even 4 sticks are going to run in dual channel mode, there is no difference in speed if the frequency is the same. 2000mhz is way too slow, the cpu benefits from faster RAM, and 3200mhz is around the sweet spot. 4x8gb is more stressing on the memory controller, but if all modules are the same and you don't mix die types, then it usually works on the advertised oc speed, but it all depends on the motherboard and the memory controller.

The dimms may have cross talk and the like.\n\nI cant tell you why, I can just say that 4 dimms, if you're going this route MUST be the same kit.

Reprovision, decommission, or simply an outage.",
      "It is highly illegal, they are not doing it ",

I'm unsure why people in this thread are even entertaining these delusions.  \n\nThe \"signal blocking paint\" that others are mentioning it is more than $250 for just over a gallon of paint.  No publicly funded(or for profit, for that matter) school is going to spend that kind of money on something that would equally disrupt the administration.\n\nThat cell phone tower that you say is in the area:  If you can see the base of the tower from your school, then you're more than likely not seeing any benefit from it and it's a red herring.  It's really, really unlikely that walking a couple hundred yards through your school would make any difference in regards to distance from a tower.\n\nThe real answers are simple and not nefarious.  First, modern cell phone signals(much like wifi signals) really, really, really don't like stone which is likely what that new wing in your school was built with.  Second, your carrier may have restructured their network by either selling off or ending lease agreements with other towers in the area.  Third, you may have unlimited data but carriers frequently have \"tiered\" access where after using a certain amount of data your speed gets throttled until the next billing cycle.  You still have \"unlimited\" access to data, but it's much slower than before the initial data set is used up.  ",

You could be seeing something like Multipath issues causing the signal to bounce around and basically jam itself.  It's also possible that you're getting EM interference from other mechanical devices that aren't functioning properly.  Electrical motors are a huge source of EMI, and are found in all sorts of places.  \n\nJammers aren't hard to detect, but the equipment is expensive. Most Cellular companies will actively watch for dead spots by looking for areas with numerous dropped calls.  You can also report deadzones to most companies, and it'll be noted, and supposedly checked out.

But what I'm looking for is **an adapter that plugs directly into the ethernet port** itself, and then broadcasts Wi-Fi out to us, if that makes sense.\n\nIf such a thing doesn't exist, how else can we improve our Wi-Fi?

    "bestcomment": [
      "What you want is called a Wireless Access Point, or WAP for short. Just search for them on amazon.",
      "If you have access to a wired connection in your flat, just hook your own router to it and use it as an access point. That will prevent any problems with the building itself blocking wifi.",
      "One thing you have to remember here is that Wi-Fi can be negatively impacted by a wide range of things:\n\n* The Wi-Fi Router itself (quality of the Router, Type of WiFi chipset inside it, quality of Firmware (or how old/new the Firmware has been updated?) \n\n* it can be environmental variables such as Distance, Obstacles, Interference from other signals (not just WiFi signals,.. but other equipment like electrical transformers or big appliances or etc) \n\n* it can be something with your end-point devices. (OS, Drivers, Wi-Fi chipset quality, BIOS/Firmware updated ?) \n\nGenerally what you want to try to do is isolate the situation, by testing with a wide range/diversity of devices. \n\n* If you test WiFi on Windows, Android, iPhone, etc.. and ALL of them are equally slow.. then you can be fairly sure the problem is not with your end-point devices. \n\n* You could also take that same combination of devices..and test it on some other WiFi (coffee shop, friends house, etc). That might help you narrow down whether it's an environmental factor or the main Router.",
      "It could be the number of routers/ap broadcasting on the same WiFi channel as yours, download an app on your phone like \"WiFi analyzer\" and see what's about, then log onto your router and change the channel in the WiFi settings. \nAnother option to try is to split the 2.4&5Ghz frequency and test which is better for your flat. :-)",
      "This is a typical case of weakest link. \n\nPossibilities.\n\n1. Most likely, your landlord is throttling your access. This is done by designating IP or even MAC address (unique to your device).  Only someone with the administrative ID and password can configure this. \n\n2. Environmental causes like building structure. Interior walls that are thick or made of dense material.  Plumbing and metal ventilation ducts. Being of different floors introduces different structure like floor joints and thicker materials. These things can greatly impact radio transmissions, which is what Wifi is. \n\n3. Angle of the antenna/s. Wifi signals don't spread out in a sphere. They spread out from the tip of the antenna in a donut shape (antenna tip in the hole). This is why quality devices have antenna stalks which can be tilted and rotated.   For multi-story single device deployments, you might find laying one antenna horizontal, and one flat. Or one say at a 45 degree and the pother vertical. \n\n4. Overlapping Wifi. ALL Wifi devices utilize a narrow band of frequencies. Basically, multiple devices on the same channel within range (~300 feet) will cause all devices to communicate more slowly. Think of those like a person talking. Now put a bunch of people taking in a room. It becomes really hard to focus on one person right.  So you have to keep asking the person you're talking to to repeat what they said.  Over and over, until you can piece a whole sentence together and you reply that you accept their whole statement. Then they send the next. And again you ask them to repeat, over and over, until you can piece a whole together. Some devices allow the admin to manually set \"channels\" hoping someone else's device isn't on the same channel. \n\n5. Total number of client devices sharing the access point's radio signals. Not to mention how much bandwidth each device is using at that given time. Say you have a 150mbit access point and you have three devices connected and using at their max. Roughly speaking, each device is only going to achieve 50mb. I'm being very rough here, but it gets the point across. \n\nMany ISP's lease all-in-one devices. I hate them. But I'm a 32 year IT professional. I supply my own cable modem. That then connects to a \"router\" which is really a switch, firewall an wireless access point. I then connect a 24 port wired switch for my wired devices, and actually a second \"router\" for my second floor. So I have two wireless devices covering a floor each. Each device is on a different channel, so they don't interfere with each over. I'm also lucky in that all my neighbors don't understand channels and they just use the default, so I am on different channels from them. I also live in a single family home, with my neighbors being 40' at least from my devices. \n\nThe end result of all this is, there might not be anything you can do. You could get a long Ethernet cable. Plug that into your landlord's ISP supplied modem/router.  Run that to your area and connect an access point or \"router\" that you bought to that cable. Then only connect to it making sure it's using a channel your landlord isn't. Or if you have an Ethernet port on your device, just connect that long cable to it",
      "You're probably not loosing speed to the ethernet cable between the modem and the wifi router, if that's what you're thinking.  If anything, the wifi router itself is probably adding more latency then the cable.  The biggest contributor is probably walls blocking the signal.  Talk to your landlord about upgrading the router, or, if you have an ethernet connection in your room, you could plug a router in there.",
      "You can just use a router. It will probably be simpler and easier to just forget about the wireless signal coming from your modem. Do ethernet to the router and connect to your nicer router via wifi. I was having an issue with mine so I got a nicer router ($200 range) and I get full speed everywhere in my place.",
      "Alright so here we go :).\n\n\nCopper is currently about 10 times faster then wireless relative to in your home Cat 5e and Cat 6 Ethernet support up to gigabit speeds, but if you are not getting that much band width then you won't see those speeds. Wireless is just another medium for moving data on what we call the physical layer of the OSI model. So, if you were to have an \"Ethernet\" wireless adapter, it would be limited by the wireless transmission. The data moving through the air is the bottleneck. That is why you do not want what you are looking for. Also it is likely the device will not work if you find it because it is likely going to be a receiver/transceiver for a client device, but those are usually USB adapters. Access points will plug into your modem or router via Ethernet and that may solve your problem but it might be more expensive then the solution I will propose in a second.\n\nThink of networks like a system of pipes and when you call your network guy, you are kind of calling a plumber.\n\n0.5 mbps sounds a bit low though. A lot of the time you can get up to 20 or 30 mbps using wireless so I would update the wireless network adapter drivers on your device from the manufacturer's website (dont use computer management, that will fail you most of the time) or in the case of a mac or a cell phone, just update your device. If your devices are updated, look into updating the firmware on your router/modem and make sure the type of signal is N not B and then if you are unable to do that then get an access point or complain to your ISP and get them to replace your modem/router if you lease it, or buy a new one if you own it.",
      "There is such a thing as an ethernet to wifi adapter. We call those wireless access points. :) So your landlord already has that in place.   \n\n\nLikely causes of slowdown:     \n\n\n1. Excessive congestion. Your neighbours may have too many wifi APs in the area, and they're all trying to scream on the same channels, slowing everything down in the process. This isn't likely as you say the internet is provided by the landlord, but maybe some people have their own internet access and set up Wifi to use it with wireless devices.\n2. Bandwidth Throttling. Your landlord may have opted to give each resident 500kbps worth of bandwidth in order to spread the 70mbps out among 140 residents. Alternatively, if there are fewer residents and the landlord is a resident theirselves, then maybe the landlord is trying to keep bandwidth available for their own use. \n3. Distance from router. If you are the furthest from the WAP, you might just have bum luck on signal quality. \n\nSolutions? \n\n1. Not much for excessive congestion. I know the struggle. I have a good 20 WAPs in my list when I look for connections. \n2. Ask your landlord to increase the allocation to each user. Maybe they can swing 1024kbps?\n3. Ask your landlord to install wireless repeaters at the edges of your complex, so distant flats can get access to stronger signals. \n4. (For all issues) Investigate your own internet access. Could 5G work for you, if available? What about DSL or cable?",
      "It sounds to me like what really needs to happen is that his *landlord* needs the WAPs installed. If you're going to offer WiFi, but only provide it from one - probably consumer grade - wireless router, and then not care it has to go through multiple walls (which at this point you should know if your offering it to tenants and charging it through rent), then you probably shouldn't provide WiFi in the first place."

I decided to take a break, so I got out my personal computer, and started searching for some entertainment materials. One video was particularly exciting, so I saved it on my computer. \n\nThe only problem was, it went into my Dropbox folder that is synced to my work computer. I didn\u2019t realize at first, until I heard a notification from my work computer. I promptly deleted it from my Dropbox folder using my personal computer, but I\u2019ve been sweating all day. \n\nHow does Dropbox Sync even work? I didn\u2019t save or delete anything on my work computer, but I know the Dropbox program running in the background did. I didn\u2019t open anything on my work computer, but I did check the folder afterwards to see if it was gone, and at first it wasn\u2019t, but a few seconds later it was. Afterwards, I deleted Dropbox. \n\nI know my workplace monitors internet browsing, but I don\u2019t know what other types of monitoring they have in place. The file had a few unsavoury words in it, so I don\u2019t know if it would have set off an alert of some sort. \n\nThanks for your help, advice, and information. \n\nEdit: a few words\n\nEdit 2: people are mentioning Dropbox for business and whether my company blocks Dropbox. We don\u2019t use Dropbox for business, and my company does block Dropbox auto updates, but not the website. \n\nEdit 3: So, I just double checked, and the website itself isn\u2019t blocked at work. When I try to use Dropbox using the desktop application at work, it says it\u2019s unable to connect, which makes me think there\u2019s some type of blocking happening while connected to the work internet. \n\nEdit 4: the Dropbox application on my desktop says that it can\u2019t establish a secure internet connection while connected to the work internet.\n\nEdit 5: the file was small (about 50 MBs), had some dirty words in the title, and a local copy was downloaded to my computer. I deleted it via the web browser 15 minutes later. \n\nEdit 6: this all happened while I was connected to my home internet connection. None of this happened while I was connected to the work internet, though I can access work visual drives remotely, so I\u2019m unclear of how connected I am while using my work computer at home.  \n\nUpdate 1: thanks for all the information and advice. I\u2019m overwhelmed by all the help - reddit truly is an amazing place!\n\nThe prevailing info I\u2019m receiving is that it\u2019s unlikely this will show up since it all happened on my home internet connection through a personal Dropbox account, I deleted it while still on my home network, and Dropbox encrypts info as it downloads/uploads.  I\u2019m hoping this is correct, but please chime in below if it isn\u2019t. \n\nSome told me I should just come clean and report it, but I\u2019m really worried this would just lead to more trouble - I work for the government in the education sector. \n\nNothing came up at work today, so I\u2019m hopeful I\u2019m in the clear, but I will start breathing a bit more easy once the week is up.

On wednesday I had an appointment at the apple store to see what they can do. Luckily the told me they can repair it under warranty. So today I gave them my iphone for repair, after two hours i got a message that i can pick it up. When i got there they told me they could not replace the display because they found water damage inside. I understand that liquid damage is not covered under warranty but my iphone was never in any water, so it must have happened while using it in the rain, which i thought it could endure. So i was pretty bumped about it but understood there was nothing they could do. A few seconds after getting it back I noticed the home button wasn\u2019t working anymore, no haptic feedback, no touch id functionality, nothing. I went to another genius and explained what happened. they even talked to the technician and the manager but they told me there was nothing they could do other than activating assistive touch and offer me a new phone for 390\u20ac, that i can under no circumstances afford. they even told me that it\u2019s likely my phone will be completely dead in a few months. i\u2018m pretty pissed, since i wasn\u2019t aware of any water damage and they didn\u2019t tell me the home button breaking would be a possibility.\n\nat this point is there anything i can do? i scheduled a phone appointment to explain them my issue again. if there\u2019s reallly nothing they can do, i must say i\u2018m very disappointed in apples way of treating damages that were caused by their attempted repair..\n\nEDIT: many of you have advised me to go back to the apple store and press the issue further, what other argument ms can i say to make them acknowledge the damage they caused, even though they found water damage?\n\nEDIT: i\u2019ve also just discovered that 3D touch is no longer working either. \n\nEDIT: talked to apple customer phone support today and sadly they basically told me the same thing. the one thing they \u201eoffered\u201c me, was looking into the probability of getting the home button back to work, but i would have to pay for it. bullshit.  i\u2018ll get the technicians report and any other regarding this case and will look further into it.

      "that info is about 15-20 years out of date. \n\nwith the old ni-cad batteries, you did this to promote longevity and avoid battery memory. this information has not held true, in regards to cell phones, in probably 15 years or so. modern phones and devices use li-ion (lithium ion) batteries, and doing such a thing to them will kill them faster. ",
      "Batteries these days are rated for close to 1k cycles. Charging it once a day, from any percentage means the battery should be good for 3 years. All devices have firmware controls to keep the battery from discharging too much and or charging too much. So when your phone shows 1-2% it's probably at around 10% and when the phone shows 100% it's at about 90-94%.\n\nWhile keeping it close to 50% is ideal, the inconvenience is not worth the pay, you might extend the battery life a bit, but you'll most likely sell/replace or break the phone before that becomes an issue :)\n\nAlso a big note, the 50-60% and kept in a cold place is meant for storage guidelines. So if the battery is kept inactive for 1 year, you want to keep it cold and at 50-60% charge, hence why new batteries you order are usually half full. Given that you use the phone constantly during the day, trying to charge it in a certain way probably doesnt provide a lot of benefit, as far as i know there haven't been any long time studies performed to confirm or quantify this.\n\nIn other words, change the phone when you need to. The best thing you can do to help the battery is protect it from extreme heat (out in the sun, or long gaming sessions where the phone becomes very hot). That damages it significantly more than letting it drop to 0.",
      "For phones, just charge it whenever you want. The charging circuitry will take care of all the batteries needs so you don\u2019t need to worry about it. Lithium polymer batteries do have certain characteristics in order to get the optimum out of them, but you don\u2019t need to worry about them in modern applications like mobile phones. If on the other hand you want to use lithium batteries in other situations (RC cars, helicopters or power tools) then charging to 95% (4.2v nominal) per cell is preferable to charging to 100%, and never drain below 3.0v (approx 20%). If storing for long periods, charge to 50% and keep above 10degC",

      "iirc, no. I actually think (don't quote me on this :P) that letting the battery drain a lot can actually cause more harm than good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have heard that with lithium ion batteries, for optimal longevity, you allow the battery to drain to ~20% and charge it to ~80%. Rinse and repeat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",
      "So happy to see people spouting the right answers for once. ",
      "No.  \n \nNicad and NiMH batteries shouldn't be allowed to drop below 1.1 volt per cell, but if it seems the battery is running down much sooner than normal during normal use, then it's OK to discharge the battery to that level. Don't do that more than about every 10-20 recharges.  Sometimes a battery runs down early because a cell inside has gone bad (must replace cell) or has reversed in polarity (can be fixed by charging just that cell for a few minutes and then charging the whole battery normally).   \n \nLithium batteries must never be deep discharged, and devices that use them contain circuitry to turn off everything when the voltage goes too low.  The batteries for some cordless power tools even have such circuitry inside them.  \n \nTry not to deep discharge lead-acid batteries, whether for a car or backup power supply."

It all depends on how the backend of the current website stores, interprets and displays that data. Your Excel import may easily just turn out to be a giant mess of text fragments and numbers.\n\nSo if it was me, I would never risk losing all my critical data hoping that I'll somehow be able to make sense of it afterwards.

      "Alright, I see a lot of good comments in here. I'm going to try and lay it out straight, all in one comment. In this plan I am going to assume that \"bad dev\" is going to try to screw you over at every point. May not be the case, but this is a plan for a worst case if you feel that you need it.\n\n1. DO NOT mention your dissatisfaction with bad dev's service, cause there goes your site. \"HDD crash\" If he feels he is no longer going to get paid, then who knows what he'll do. (I don't, I'm just assuming worst case.)\n2. Domain Name. If you don't own the domain name directly and don't have something in your contract about owning it, he's got you over a barrel. You'll most likely have to pay him for it, or get a new domain name. If your domain name is used in your email addresses(admin@mybiz.com)... This means new email addresses as well(admin@mycoolbiz.com)... So hopefully you own your domain name.\n3. Scrape the data from your site. If it is a lot of data, hire someone to make a crawler that will scrape the data for you.\n4. Insert scraped data into a database. A REAL DBMS. With indexes and SQL support and what not. I'm scared to see the latency in your website if bad dev directly modifies csv files for database operations.\n5. Hire a \"new dev\" to make a solution / public site(Not sure which you have here) for your business. Have them develop it separate from everything on a separate server (most likely his computer as a local host) so bad dev won't catch wind of it. You still want your site up while you build your new one right?\n6. Once your new site is finished, if bad dev has access to any accounts that relate to your business(registrar/host[godaddy or alternative], google, facebook, etc), change the passwords and make sure he does not have access.\n7. Also, you should be scraping the data as often as possible to update your scraped data database. Ideal solution is to set it to scrape every 10 minutes? Hour? Night? Depends on the rate of data updating on your site. This way you will have the most recent data entered onto your site if it goes down due to a... \"HDD Crash.\"\n8. Contact your bad dev and discuss separation and access to the raw data files and a database backups. If they are useless then you already have your scraped data and if he screws with anything it won't affect you, and he's now locked out of your business's accounts unable to do any harm to your new system.\n9. If the files bad dev gives you are indeed useful, you should give them to new dev to utilize in his solution.\n10. Purchase your own hosting plan, make sure you own your domain and make sure you're in control of the account and its data. You do not want a repeat of having your company held hostage by one vindictive person.\n10. From here, hopefully you will be able to just update your DNS record to point to your new site and then you'd pretty much be done.\n\nAlso, make sure new dev is someone professional that you can trust.",

Databases can be exported into a lot of formats, .csv is one of them.\n\nThe contents of the .csv are probably stated on the contract since the way a database is exported can be chosen to dismiss portions of data. So be very careful as data can be destroyed very easily in the process. If you don't know how the database was built there's little you can do to verify all the data is exported. Maybe talk to a lawyer and see if there's anyway to make him do this while supervised by an external expert to guarantee he doesn't omit or destroy data in the process.\n\nThe file can be used to rebuild the database that can be used to power another website if it needs it. Some sites might just store an email mailinglist.\n\nConsidering we don't know what the current website is, 400/month whichever currency it is doesn't mean anything. Some websites cost a lot, most don't ask around when you get a new one.",

      "I want to mirror suggestions to get a lawyer and/or some outside help. This guy is literally holding your entire company hostage. If he deletes everything, you can sue him for it, but the data will be gone and the company will go under, making the entire point moot. You need to tread very carefully. You need to do whatever you can to preserve your data without him knowing what's up, even if that means semi-automatically or manually saving web pages of that data to disk. Once the guy gets a whiff that you're thinking of cutting him loose, you're potentially dead in the water. No amount of legal wrangling will magic your data back from the dead.\n\nYou need a full dump of your database in its native dump format and a complete copy of the file structure of your entire website. With those two things a competent webmaster can get you back up and running fairly quickly. CSVs are absolutely unacceptable. Proper DB dumps or lawsuit, his choice. Getting an outside professional to supervise the process and making him do it in person sounds like the best way to make sure he doesn't screw you to the wall. But remember, ONLY do this after you've preserved as much important data as you can first. The outside pro would be an ideal partner for getting this done. Be prepared to spend money; $400 a month is honestly very cheap for a competent computer service provider and about right for what it sounds like you ended up with."

It's safest to just spray it down with electronic parts cleaner that's rated safe for all plastics or with 90%+ pure alcohol. Maybe a round toothpick (not flat) can remove it.  \n\nThermal paste is harmless unless it contains pure metal powder that can cause a short, like Arctic Silver, and maybe even that won't hurt because mixing metal powder into grease makes the conduction a lot worse.  \n\nIf that's a hard piece, it's either one of the capacitors from the CPU or a pin from the socket.

      "Phone company tech here. That looks like a fancy phone line to me. You more than likely have  dsl type service since it looks the signal is coming in through the blue white pair. The wire was probably already damaged there at one point and some lazy ass just added that junction box and spliced it there and added new wire. Or the modem may have been installed there at some point and when someone else moved in wanted it relocated. Those connectors look cheap as it is already. And if there\u2019s another junction box like that one it means that\u2019s another crappy splice point. The reason your signal is going out when the door closes is because when you attempted to repair it you obviously didn\u2019t do a great job and created a high open. Meaning one side of the bare copper is not creating a good contact. Also forget the tape it\u2019s low voltage and tape does nothing but hide the wires. Remove the tape and Strip the ends of the insulation back until a lil bitch of bare copper is showing and then twist the pairs together. Or like others have said just call your isp and let the tech fix it. I\u2019ve been a tech for over 16 years and that\u2019s less than a 5 minute fix. And it\u2019s up to the tech if he wants to charge. I don\u2019t charge people unless they are dicks or they actually need a brand new wire run. Call the isp dont give them specifics over the phone. Just say the internet is intermittent. When the tech shows up tell him about the dog chewing the wire and if he could help you out. I\u2019ve done several hours of labor just for a soda or a snack if the people are nice.",

Within a day I was experienced the same 100% disk usage, the same freezes, the same BAD_CONFIG_INFO errors, the same shit. Suspect.\n\nI took it back, they ran some \"scans\" and apparently it came back fine, except it fuckin froze on the desk in front of me while he booted it up.\n\nHere's the real kicker though. I'm troubleshooting on my own, and I'm running CrystalDiskInfo, and it says Caution, 200 reallocated sectors and such...and that the hard drive has over 5,000 hours of power up time. \n\nWhat the fuck!?

I am very pissed, I payed for the warrenty but more importantly the amount of time I've wasted on this bullshit I will never get back. \n\nTomorrow I'm going to Best Buy to speak to a manager. \n\nIs there anything else that might help my case? What can I get out of this? Who can I punch in the neck for this fuckery??\n\nUPDATE:\n\nJust got back, I asked for the manager and explained the situation, then showed them the picture of the CrystalDiskInfo screen. She immediately said okay, and (like you said) they are going to replace the Hard Drive in store but it will have Windows 10 on it (those bastards finally got me!!). It will take 2-3 days, which is fine as I'll be away for the weekend.\n\nSo, it seems my problem has been solved, thanks for the advice!!!",

      "Hi. Previous Geek Squad front lead here.\n\nI recommend going back in, booting up the laptop and show them the crystaldiskinfo window. Be sure to explain what happened first and tell them you are sure you have been wronged.\n\nMake your stand right there. Tell them this is unacceptable and that you need a new hard drive, not one that has been used at all. You paid for the warranty, you deserve a new drive at this point. You've been in there at least twice and this is your third time.\n\nIf the drive needs an operating system because it's the only drive in the laptop, they will need to install the OS on the new drive. If you are able to do it yourself and you have the proper installation media, it will likely be faster for you to do it yourself.\n\nGeek Squad is no longer allowed to keep disk images of operating systems in the store or in file format anymore. This means if they install any OS in the store, it's a new OS purchased or given to you from off the shelf. Since Windows 10 is likely the only OS they sell in any of the stores, you'd be getting Windows 10.\n\nIt's unlikely they will give you the OS, but there are circumstances they may eat the cost. If your laptop does not officially support Windows 10, you may have trouble with drivers, especially Wifi and they may tell you Windows 10 will not work right. They would be partially correct in this.\n\nIf they try telling you they will need to ship the laptop off to have the hard drive replaced and OS installed, this could take more than a few days. If they are able to order a hard drive with OS pre-installed, this will also take time.\n\nIf you have already waited long enough, you can tell them you cannot wait any more and that you need the issue resolved as soon as possible.\n\nIt is definitely in their power to make an exception for you, eat the cost of a new hard drive off the shelf, eat the cost of the OS and eat the cost of time it takes for a technician to put in your hard drive + install Windows 10 in the same day if you go in early enough.\n\nIf they are extremely busy and/or understaffed, you might be waiting until the next day.\n\nThe question is: will they? The managers are the ones who have the power to do this. If they've eaten too much cost, they may actually try to deny giving you a new drive and OS. If you have restore discs, bring them in with you, they can also install from your discs.\n\nProvide all the proof you can. Serial number of the hard drive, box if they gave you one, receipt, paperwork, everything you can. It will help your case.\n\nPlease keep in mind that not all of the Best Buy stores have the most competent experts. If they truly are incompetent, rude and refuse to help you (even the store manager), you might be stuck calling 1-888-BESTBUY and complaining. \n\nEdit: as someone else had mentioned: you don't need to yell at them or swear. Be professional, but yet stern. You have been wronged and have waited longer than expected by their own standards. Good stores will understand.",
      "Best Buy told a customer they would have to replace their laptop because their motherboard had failed and they couldn't replace it. The customer came to my shop and I quickly discerned it was a bad DC jack. Like $180 fix.\n\nMore than once a week, though, I encounter a customer who said that Best Buy sent them to us. \n\nA Geek Squad interviewer told me at a bar that they look for 80% personality and only 20% technical knowledge. I was offered a job that night, but seriously, $10 bucks an hour? I have my CCNA and nearly 18 years professional experience. Obviously, being employed at a company with far better tools and pay, I respectively declined.\n\nI was working at a hotel company (a huge one, I might add) as the Linux administrator.\n\nGeek Squad, imo, is the fast food of IT. Worst thing is, they aren't very fast. They had another customer's laptop for three weeks only to come back and say they couldn't fix it because it was, again, a bad motherboard and they don't work on laptops. It was a bad stick of RAM. $45 plus tax plus 37.50 in labor to test it in the system. I had them fixed the same day. The customer was so happy, he decided to buy his son a laptop. I don't make commission from sales but from labor. Still, I loved it when he said, \"I need to get one anyway. I was just going to go down to Best Buy, but you fixed me so quickly, I want to buy from you.\"\n\nedit: also, why am I working at a computer shop when I was working for a fortune 500 company? I'm the web developer so I get to do what I love and with my labor commission, I make more and I make so many fucking connections with local businesses, I could likely do this freelance now. I know everyone in town.\n\nSeriously: bad motherboard? The access panel to the RAM was ONE SCREW. And it was giving BEEP CODES, and with a quick google search, lo and behold, A BAD STICK OF RAM.\n\nThe axiom of IT: If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit. Sad world. There is nothing more honest and trustworthy than a man who can admit, \"I don't know.\" But I can find out for you.",
      "You could boot to a hiren's Boot disk, and use one of the utilities to \"recover\" previous partitions. If anything shows up in the list, then yes, it was used before. Even more incriminating is if you browse to a location that has personal information and show them that you've recovered the old data.",
      "Do NOT be that cunt that starts yelling at Geek Squad. They don't replace your hard drive in store under warranty. They send it off to the service center. Talk to a manager, be calm, show evidence.",
      "Side note here... whatever the result is with Best Buy, you may have other avenues.  If the computer is still under the manufacturer's warranty, you can contact them.  If not, check the drive itself.  Seagate and Western Digital generally have decent warranties on the parts themselves and you may be able to contact the hard drive company directly for a replacement.",
      "Used to work at Geek Squad, actually have tech knowledge, AMA.\n\nBut seriously, I didn't even know they offer a warranty on hard drives....I just had my laptop repaired by them because my new flash drive shredded both of my USB 3.0 ports, my Ethernet jack was no longer working, and my memory card reader stopped working as well.  Sent it out, got it repaired and sent back within 2 weeks, including them ordering parts.  They replaced motherboard, daughterboard, palm rest and transferred Dell service tag over to the new Mobo.\n\nTo be fair, I popped out my SSD and put the original 1TB SHHD back into the computer before handing it to them.  That drive has never been used and I only keep it as a backup for situations like this.\n\nWhen I worked at Geek Squad, they made a huge deal about data/data privacy/keeping shit straight.  I once apparently gave the wrong HDD to a customer, and they returned it months later because it had another customer's business data on it (which I still, to this day, don't believe I did).  Was called into the manager's office and given a very stern warning, threatened my job etc.\n\nYes, geek squad is probably 99% sales, which is why I fucking hated it, but the guys and gals who do it are (sometimes) way smarter than you give them credit for.  At my store we had almost every person their pursuing certs and better jobs.  One of the guys was really good with HP repairs so anytime an HP laptop came in, we'd charge the labor, he'd fix it real quick and we'd give it back.\n\nTurn time was a bitch and everyone hated how long things took, but they've forced a reservation system now which has really streamlined things.  People would wait forever in line because the person before them would expect free work and pester us with a 1000 questions, or be the 95 y/o who literally needed to be taught how to use a computer (not my fucking job, sorry).\n\nI have tons of other stories and can offer insight on some of the inner workings if anyone is interested. PS: Geek Squad tech support is an absolute fucking joke, don't EVER buy it. But the hardware warranties are pretty good and you can get your money back twice over in just one or two repairs.",

There are photos, bank information, emails with account numbers for insurance issues and so much more on his work laptop. Unfortunately he has a password on that and so far the only answers I've received for being able to access this laptop is that they would have to essentially erase everything. I am technologically challenged (Just learned how to check my voicemail on my cell phone yesterday for the first time) so I wanted to get your opinions on this. \n\nIs there absolutely any way that I would be able to access his laptop without erasing everything? At a bare minimum all of our family photos are stored on either his, or our shared laptop (which I don't have access to his account on either) The insurance things and bank issues are things that I will likely be able to solve without but it will be a pain. Mostly I would just be devastated to see years worth of these photos lost. Also, we have external hard drives laying around that supposedly have photos and videos and god knows what. I have no idea how to use these things. Basically I'm just a wreck and never planned to not have him around to solve these issues so I really don't know where to begin with all of technology things around the house but these laptops seem like a good place. Thank you so much. \n\nEdit- Thank you so much for the help so far. I originally came here in a panic after being informed by several people that in order to access the laptops I would need to erase essentially everything. At this point I have accessed his account on our shared laptop and been able access hundreds of photos that I thought might be lost forever. And his work has volunteered to help access anything they can through his work laptop. \n\nAt this point the only minor issue I'm having a prompt on his account saying something about a verification pin that is needed. I'm not sure what that is or if it's even important. Any help on that one would be nice, although it might be something unimportant. I don't know. ",

I found a prototype online (I did not create this and do not own any rights: [Hands-free prototype](https://www.behance.net/gallery/11197981/Hands-free-Electrolarynx_Academic-Project-2011)) but the designer said the idea has never entered a \"working phase.\" \n\nI am hoping to surprise him for his birthday or Christmas with a hands-free device to help give him some of his life back. I know this is a stretch, but I want to take a chance in case this post reaches SOMEONE who can make this dream of my dad's come true. I will be reaching out to some college engineering programs as well. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SHARE and message me with any serious interests or questions!\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, thank you all. \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f",

    "post": "Update: Success!!!! Thank you for all the suggestions and help. Man it feels like I just took a massive shit. I ended up using WinDirStat and let it run for about six hours. I think I probably could have used pretty much any of the techniques I tried and just waited, but I was able to monitor WDS working via task mansger. Case closed. \n\nSo, I made a clip recording of a .avi file via vlc years ago. The original file couldn't have been more than five gigs. I don't remember but maybe my computer lost power or something but it saved the file in my video folder as avi-.ts (and later I realize it's massive). I couldn't open it at the time and every time I touched it or even opened the folder it crashed my windows explorer. I tried changing the folder settings to general items because I thought maybe my comp was trying to load a preview or something, that didn't help.\n\nFast forward to three years later and today I realize the file is 190 gigs, which is a fifth of my old Toshiba Satellite hard drive. I'm like, shit, this guy has to go. So I right click. Windows explorer crashes, and after it restarts my computer is still super slow so I do a machine restart and everything is fine but still got a massive file to kill.\n\nI start googling and found File Assassin. Download it, install, head to the folder and try all the options and every time File Assassin stops responding. Then I Google some more and start safe mode and try to force delete with Powershell and the command prompt, as well as trying File Assassin in safe mode. I appear to have entered the commands properly but in both tools I enter the command and nothing happens but my computer gets super slow again. I end process for Windows Explorer in Task Manager and it doesn't restart on its own so ctrl alt delete and restart. That's where I'm at now.\n\nWhat in the world?\n\ntl;dr I have what appears to be a video file that's 190 gigs that I can't delete no matter what I do.",

It will appear all desktop items will be missing and all files are missing but they've just been set to a hidden attribute. There's a utility called \"unhide.exe\"  to undo this that is very easy to find on the bleeping computer site. However, unhide doesn't always restore the shortcuts stored in the app data.  Navigate to the app data folder and manaully backup the 3 folders containing all the menu items first before running ccleaner or it's going to be a long night restoring those shortcuts manually. ",

However most likely the monitor was made with lead-free solder, which can be incompatible and melts at something like 40-50 Celcius hotter temperature.  If you just add leaded solder to a lead-free joint, the result may look awful, so the old solder should be remove with either a suction plunger or bulb or, better, copper desoldering braid.  The braid should be about 2-3 mm wide, and cut it off right after using it because used wick will just absorb heat away from the joint."

I'm going to guess that your budget is very low.I think you're going to cause yourself more problems in the long run.\n\nWhat are you editing on? 4k is 4 times the data as 1080p. So it'll be roughly 4 times the work for the computer to process it and render it.You will want to preserve your original interview footage even after you've produced your final video. Bigger files need more storage and more $.\n\nDepending on the type of interviewing you're doing, you may not need to do any post-shoot work to make it look good.Are you sitting down with people in a studio where you can control the lighting. Having good lighting is most likely worth more than having 4k.Will your phone be on a tripod? Again a stable shot is worth more than shooting in 4k.I would think you'd like to have longer than 5 or 15 min conversations when you're interviewing. I suppose this depends on the type of work. But getting interrupted because the phone is over heating and having to ask your guest to repeat something seems like a massive distraction and headache.\n\nThe rest of the comments seem to be in favor of shooting in 4k so I'll let them talk about the good things.But just the time limit for interviews and reporting would make me not touch it.",

Odds of the hard drive being damaged or you losing data are fairly low though in my experience with dealing with laptops that have had things spilled on them. Generally your motherboard is going to absorb the brunt of the damage from liquids so worst case scenario you plug the hard drive in elsewhere with an adapter and copy your data off of it.\n\nLet it dry at least a few days with no power or battery (assuming yours is removable) and then cross your fingers and try turning it on.",

If you can put it in someplace warm/hot to help drying, opening as much as you can without losing screws or forgetting how it goes back together to help.\n  \nA fan blowing on it close, like a foot will also help move moisture out.\n  \nThe damage really depends on if there was damage from a short or rapid cooling of something that was hot then shocked by the liquid or the forming of corrosion on contacts.  None of those are good, there's always a chance it will be minimal but the first thing to do when liquid is introduced to electronics is to yank power.\n  \nThere are plenty of videos on how to pull a harddrive from a computer, you can lookup your model and see yourself.

First point of call.\nNot gonna lie, with that HDD all of the below will take sweet time - but yes, there's a lot you  can do with patience - just give each step time - it's common AF for things to hang for aaages on 83%.  \n\n\n200Gb remaining on a 1TB HDD is not a lot, your poor mechnical drive has a hell of a lot of legwork to do especially if it's a fragmented clusterfuck with large chunks of games scattered in there - also check your apps and games, get on to some basic housekeeping, uninstall your old crap and check what you have running in the background that could be consuming resources.  \nThe biggest culprit *could be* windows update churning through 1903 update which also summons DISM and will turn a system to cold treacle.  \n\n  \n  \n**BACK UP YOUR ESSENTIALS, I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. CLOUD STORAGE OR EXTERNAL HDD. DO IT**  \n\nTask manager is your friend (ctrl+shift+esc)\n\nOpen yourself an elevated (admin) command prompt (win key+R, type \"cmd\", hold ctrl+shift while pressing enter)\n\n1) chkdsk c: /f /r (this should take a few hours and must run uninterrupted, just leave it alone! - check your hdd for filesystem errors and marks bad sectors. Requires reboot.)\n\n\n2) DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth (To make sure sfc, which you're using next, can pull shiny new files from the windows image should anything be fubared)\n\n3) sfc /scannow (system file checker, finds corrupt and damaged windows system files and has a good shot at replacing them)\n\n4) windows cleanup utility (Yes, it's awesome - skip the first screen by going straight to \"clean system files\" - understand what you'll be removing and tick as you see fit, ask if you're not sure, google-fu young grasshoppa. Old redundant update data, memory dumps and cache clutter are what we want to kick in the figurative balls)  \n  \n5) Defrag (yes windows own, run a vanilla defrag once you're happy with what has been cleaned - the command prompt even has a boot defrag option... googlefu!)  \n  \n6) Windows update - Go check, we want a big green tick that reminds us of Chuck Norris.  \n  \n7) Drivers - Chipset and Graphics mainly, windows is pretty damn good at the rest.\n\nCheck device manager for any oddities and problems.  \n  \n&nbsp; \n  \nAssuming you actually do NEED loads of storage, consider an upgrade, an external backup to migrate all your shit to give your machine breathing space and absolutely get an ssd - even a small one just for a few apps and windows itself.  \nHDD - Inexpensive, slow. Great backup incase (mostly, look at firecuda drives though, I love them)  \n  \nSSD - SATA OR NVME, variably more expensive and fast - ranging from affordable to a deal with satan. Avoid cheap knockoffs and go quality branded like Samsung. Siliconpower are cheap on Amazon (2.5\" 256GB SSD) and are pretty fast. Not backup. Defo not backup.  \n  \nEDIT: If you do get an ssd to replace the windows drive, backup what you need first away from your current HDD - then use something like HDD Sentinel to do a full surface read/write test on the HDD. This also shows SMART data - I doubt it's failure, I just think windows is constipated in a sea of data.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nAlso, going back to task manager, it has the \"startup\" tab. Check what's in there and if you don't recognise anything just bang its full name into a search engine of your choosing. Some stuff just isn't essential or is cumbersome and bloaty - investigate what you can whittle down.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nP.p.s: Windows page file is also lurking in that hdd jungle, argh!  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nR.e.s.p.t.cp.ipwtf:  Side note on overclocking, if you went balls out on GPU or CPU at any point and made your system fall over - corruption can very easily happen if power delivery isn't quite right on a bus or if a garbled blob of noise gets spat onto the HDD.",

That said, something to try first before just buying a new drive (aside from running diagnostics) is to update drive firmware and see whether you get issues booting into safe mode or a clean boot. If it works fine there, you don't need new hardware.\n\nIf that doesn't work, you could also try a Reset This PC > Keep My Files. It will uninstall your games and other applications, but you won't lose any of your files. Beyond that you'd want to reinstall the OS using a USB to completely rule out software. \n\nIf you do determine you have a failing drive, I'd pop it into another slot on the board and make sure it's not an issue with the board. It's unlikely, but it's an easy enough step to try before you buy anything.",

In cases where no one else is using more, it will let them use more, but if others are using too, it will throttle down to the allocated guaranteed bandwidth.\n\nAs far as logins/passwords, I don't have a lot of experience there, but this is something you could potentially use a commercial router for, as well as bandwidth limits for users.\n\nOtherwise, residential wifi routers can often broadcast multiple guest networks.  You could potentially assign different passwords going that route, and I think some even have the ability to assign bandwidth from there.  But you'd need to be able to broadcast enough networks for however many users you have on it.\n\nNot sure which is going to be best for your situation, but hopefully this gives you a few ideas until someone else pops in here with a bit more knowledge.",

      "I agree with /u/CamiloDFM, but in the opposite order that he/she suggests - but also have one other possible suggestion at the end (that actually ended up being the cause of similar problems I had experienced).\n\nFirst, always check the event viewer when something weird happens.  This is not 100% though.  I've had sudden shutdowns that were almost certainly due to thermal problems but there was no record in the event viewer (at any diag level) other than \"the previous shutdown was unexpected\".  When the kernel sees a problem, it shuts down fast and hard to avoid harm to the system.  Sometimes, the event that caused the problem doesn't have a chance to get written.\n\nSecondly, as /u/CamiloDFM suggests, sometimes something unusual happens that causes a sudden shutdown.  All the things he/she suggests are possible, including cosmic rays.  If it happens \"more than a few times\", it's worth digging deeper and using tools like thermal monitors to try to track the problem down.\n\nIn addition to heat, I'd keep my eye on my power supply.  Those are the 2 biggies in my experience.\n\nMy new suggestion isn't sexy but was actually the cause of unexplained, infrequent, random shutdowns: *My power bar went flaky on me*.  I swapped it out and, boom, my problems disappeared.  The old power bar is now used for my Christmas lights.  They don't care about the occasional millisecond blip in current (AFAIK - redditors, please correct me if I'm slowly trashing my Christmas lights by using a kinda flaky power bar).",

I know it sounds stupid and silly and I know that most other people already knew about Windows 8.1.\n\nBut it brings a lot of benefits! Starting with the fact that you can install windows 8.1 in UEFI mode (you can significantly reduce boot times), continuing with the fact that that you have secure boot and ending with the fact that your performance hit is not as big as it would be if you moved to 10!\n\nI'm on a core i5-4690. I have virtually identical performance between windows 7 and 8 but 8 offers me the UEFI boot which has given me the possibility to sit in front of the pc, press the start button and 10 seconds later enter any software I'm using and move on with my work without waiting. Which basically offered me the benefit of never worrying about leaving the PC on, sleep and wake up from sleep is also a lot faster. But on Windows 10? On Windows 10 I'm seeing almost severe performance issues. Starting with the fact that I'm losing about 20-30% performance when browsing on a website that is a bit more complex (facebook comes to mind). Continuing with the fact that on 8.1, I'm doing just fine performance wise and I'm even able to access other windows just fine with no problem. On Windows 10, the issues increase 10-fold when slowdowns appear. The whole PC becomes choppy and unresponsive at times (like for example when I'm on facebook, the WHOLE UI of the PC slows down considerably and on 8.1 I never felt such slowdowns).\n\nYou can continue using windows 8.1 through January of 2023 (That's the end of the extended support).\n\nOn Windows 8.1 you have control over which updates you install and uninstall without Microsoft spitting updated at your desktop.\n\nYou have considerably less telemetry on windows 8.1 (and you have guides on how to almost fully disable all of them).\n\nHate the start menu? No problem, start8 is here to save the day.\n\nAnd performance wise in games/pro grade apps is slightly, ever so slightly better than what you're finding on the already speedy windows 7.\n\nWait! Before you ahead and begin upgrading. I recommend you **fully reinstall windows rather than upgrading**.\n\nOh and one *very* important thing to note. The Microsoft Update Catalog software on windows 8.1 is SHIT. It takes me up to 3 hours to find updates for my PC with it. Go on google and search for \"Windows8.1-KB3138615-x64\" (without the comas) and download it. Make it the first thing you install on your fresh windows 8.1 installed copy (before you install anything). That will significantly reduce the first update scan to about 5 minutes tops and subsequently lower and lower.\n\nTrust me when I say you're much better off with Windows 8.1. And for those with SSDs (heck, even HDDs), go ahead, convert your storage to gpt format and install windows 8.1 in UEFI mode.\n\n(and disable fast start-up which you can find under the \"choose what my power buttons do\" section inside Power Options, it doesn't do shit) You have quick guides on how to disable most of the UI from Windows 8.1 as well in case you hate it so don't fret.\n\n**TL;DR**: I heavily recommend to each and every single one of you on windows 7 to give a solid chance to Windows 8.1. I hated it at the beginning however through time I found out that Windows 8.1 is actually superior to 7 in many ways and you can make it look like 7 a lot more than you think. Windows 8.1 also brings UEFI support (Which allows you to boot insanely quick if you're on SSD) and secure boot (which offers a level of protection). Performance on windows 8.1 is almost always better than 7 (even if it's by just 0.5-2%). It is a great option for those stuck on hardware made before windows 10 came due to that hardware being better optimized for what was the best windows at that moment which was 7 or 8.1 for most. Someone on a haswell chip or even a broadwell chip (or even FX series) would better benefit migrating to 8.1 rather than going to 10 and suffering performance issues that are right now not really a problem only on 9th gen over at Intel and Ryzen+ over at AMD.",
      "Instead of getting patches once a month like now (hoo boy that sounds really secure) we get none. So if writing malware instead of shopping around for an exploit no one has made public yet you will shop for *any* exploit (hoo boy that sounds like a really big difference). But from experience, 75% of Win7 machines have a broken windows update process anyway, get no updates at all and the users never notice.\n\nAs we have learned after the EOS for Win98 and WinXP it means that all the hacksors come out of the woodwork and storm your OS like a plague of locusts. Oh wait no, we haven't. But why? Because no one gives a shit about those old trashboxes because their owners are not the ones easily parted from their money. That they dont have.\n\nRemember WannaCry? Everyone going: Woah now all the XP boxes are fucked! Ha! Well, no. WannaCry doesn't work on WinXP because it wasn't optimized for it. Because, why would it?",

    "post": "Not sure if this goes here, if it doesn't please point me to where it should go.\n\nAnyways, with all the recent upset with Best Buy and people posting their stories, i'll post mine that happened recently here which stands as a testament of why you should be wary of the Geek Squad.\n\nLast year I bought a laptop for college, I then bought the Geek Squad Black Tie protection on it as they would fix anything I had issues with over the next 3 years. A week after this, I bought a seperate hard drive and installed it alongside the HDD that came stock (it has 2 HDD Bays) \n\nSo anyways, fast forward a year and after it's first year of use it got sent back to the Geek Squad to repair a sound card issue and a few other minor problems. \n\nI send it in, get a call saying one of my HDDs is bad and needs to be replaced (odd) so I ask which one, they confirm it was the stock one that comes with the laptop, not the aftermarket. So I give them permission to remove THAT one. \n\nOnce I received my laptop, upon bootup, I noticed they uninstalled my Windows 8, odd because the OS was on my personal HDD. Upon looking at the drives, I had a C drive with 373GB of storage, and a D Drive with 350GB of storage. (I had a 1TB and a 750GB before) so I check disk management and find out that I only had one HDD partitioned to look like I had 2 of them. \n\nOff to Best Buy we go, I wait my turn patiently, go up to the counter and say that I received my laptop after repair and my personal hard drive was missing from the computer. The employee's response? \"What do you want me to do about it\", we had to get the supervisor over and went through the entire scenario, they told us to check back in 3 days.\n\n5 days down the road I get a call from Best Buy, the person said \"So you want the data recovery on this hard drive right?\", completely annoyed by now, I exclaimed \"NO! I WANT MY HARD DRIVE BACK\", they claimed it was against company policy, so I had to explain I never gave them permission to remove that hard drive. After that, I got the \"Oh.... we are going to have to look into this\" message, and 5 days later again I get the phone call saying they screwed up and are now shipping the hard drive to the store where I could pick it up.\n\nFinally after 2.5 weeks I received my personal hard drive. \n\nI would give them the benefit of the doubt but then why was my remaining hard drive partitioned to look like 2 hard drives? That leads me to believe they screwed up / attempted to steal it, and tried to cover their tracks. Imagine how many more people are victim of these scenarios and just aren't able to recognize this? A missing gig of ram, who will notice, understand what i'm getting at here. Even if it weren't stolen, it is possible that components might go missing through negligence which is possibly what happened and someone who isn't tech savvy would never notice.\n\nAnyways, I hope my story makes people worry about their computer with best buy, and that they will always check to make sure they aren't being screwed over.

I handed over my resume and the manager glanced at it.\n\n\"Have any sales experience?\"\n\n\"Yes, some.\"\n\n\"Alright, we'll give you a call.\"\n\nNext day they made an offer.  Geek Squad doesn't have technically savvy people, as that's not who they're looking to hire.  It's a cushy position at Best Buy that pays more than the average blue shirt.  Stop buying from Best Buy.",
      "My brothers laptop wouldn't boot so he took it to them. The told him it was the mobo and and it would be $400. My brother bought a new llaptop. I told him to give me the broken one. I replaced the keyboard with a $10 off of ebay and it worked fine after that",
      "Former agent here:\n\nIf this was a sound card issue, it probably got shipped out to the main svc center in Kentucky.  The point where the agents that you spoke to are getting confused at is that they believe you are referring to wanting your original (failed) hard drive back instead of your secondary (personal property) drive.  On that note they are correct in the fact that once a hard drive gets replaced under GSP it becomes the property of the company.\n\nIn fact you're pretty lucky that the service center called you at all since we used to tell customers 'I can send it out but I CANNOT assure you that your data is coming back, please backup on your own or through us' and still get hell when they didn't back up and low and behold their computer comes back with a brand new HDD and all of their stuff is gone.  TBH I asked every client if they had any extra RAM/hardware or accessories on their comp before we shipped it just because we had a few of these issues (fucksake how many logtiech wireless dongles didn;t come back).\n\nI can't really speak to how they reinstalled your W7 because it can vary if the service center did it or the precinct may have done it, but either way that's a pretty retarded way to reinstall the OS.  And about the stealing hardware etc, the person stealing from a customer computer is kind of unheard of on a store level since a lot of internal theft would rather opt to steal brand new stuff that's on the shelves since the penalty is the same anyway.  From what I understand the service center guys are pretty heavily monitored but that wasn't my area so I can't really speak for it. RAM? lol we had a shitload of 'tester' ram that got stripped from any 'store used' computer (not the IBMs, just computers 'used' by the store for live demos etc) that was being junked (like enough to fill a mobo sized static bag easy).\n\nTL:DR Service center shenanigans + probably inexperienced agents = don't send out personal equipment with your shit with bestbuy.\n\n\n\nP.S.  Not defending the store in any way, just wanted to give some insight.",
      "Remember that Geek Squad Agents are all individuals, and some of them are very talented. Many are salesmen, but some are genuinely good technicians just trying to get by. \n\nBefore you walk up with your broken computer, strike up a chat with one of them. Ask them a question you know the answer to. Get a read on how knowledgeable they are and see if they seem like the kind of person who knows their stuff, or if they're just steering the conversation towards a sale. \n\nIf you find a good one, they can be a great resource for repair information. I have personally known several Geek Squad Agents who love nothing more than chatting with people about complex technical problems. The kind of Agent who knows their stuff doesn't want to sell you stuff. They don't even want that crappy job, they're just trying to pay the rent while finishing college or looking for a Sys Admin job. They would rather look like they're neck deep in a sale when they're actually collaborating with someone who appreciates their knowledge. ",
      "Former agent here\n\nSince they replaced your original HDD, per policy they reinstall your original OS onto that drive. Additionally, they are not responsible for any hardware that is not installed by a GS agent. You know that piece of paper you signed when you shipped off your laptop? Unless you stated it under \"accessories\" the service center will just give you the big FU. Store management might do something, but chances are they will refer you to the corporate #.\n\nMy advice, email or write a letter to the CEO. Trust me, I've seen people do it and get what they want within reason. ",
      "I had a friend who worked in Geeksquad in highschool and these kindsnof \"accidents\" were common",
      "Sounds more like a case of Hanlon's Razor : \n\nNever attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\n\nDoesn't excuse the mistake/hassle, of course, but there you go.\n",
      "As a former agent I can tell you that Best Buy ran the Geek Squad brand into the ground. They care more about sales than actual tech support. They also have a culture that promotes them hiding behind wavers and rewards inexperience. I used to take it as a point of pride that I worked for Geek Squad. Now days I don't really mention it at all.\n\nAs for your outcome, you're lucky you got your old drive back at all. ",
      "This is not specific to Best Buy, it is inherent to chain stores, buy from local computer stores.",
      "Geek Squad and Best Buy in general is running themselves into the ground. Kinda sad to see, but its true. Their services are terrible anymore. Never hear anything good about them. I work in the computer repair and sales industry and I can't even begin to tell you the amount of Best Buy hate we get."

This is rarely the sole way a site tracks preferences, as it would not serve your mom well if she was using the same IP address, but had a \"midget preference\". However a lot of sites, like YouTube, use a combination of all three. The solution to your \"milf preference\" issue if ip-based would be to change your ip, sign in thru a vpn, proxy or thru a tor browser.

If you are taking it apart anyway to check the battery, check the button cable as well. ",
      "That shouldn't really be possible. You can set the power button in windows to do nothing, but, at a hardware level, it should still turn the device on. Some suggestions I would try:\n\n1. If the battery is removable, remove it, hold the power button for 20 seconds, then plug it in with the battery still out and try and turn it on. Hopefully if it's just in a hibernation (and thus windows still controlling the button) this will kill it\n2. If the battery is not removable, try and give it another day without charging it. Hopefully the thing will fully die, and windows will lose any control over the power button\n\nIf none of those work, I would be a lot more suspicious that he wrecked the thing, and is trying to make some stupid excuse... idk why though, the end result is you still can't use your laptop so not sure what benefit he thinks that would get him? Maybe stall as he tries to think of a way to fix it? But people become really stupid when they think they're going to be on the hook for hundreds of dollars because they broke something.",
      "A registry edit only would effect windows if it won\u2019t power on from being entirely off that means you have a potential hardware issue. ",
      "Does charging led indicates charge when you connect power cable? Power button is not configurable, possible your PC is \"hang\". Would suggest charge battery (at least couple hours) remove battery (if possible), keep it that for couple minutes, add back, and try power button again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn case battery is not removable, try press power button for at least 10 seconds.",
      "If you can open your laptop, try finding the CMOS battery (a little round battery normally) take it out, hold down the power for about 10 seconds and put it back in. That resets the BIOS settings. Also your roommate is a dickhead",

      "I work at an IT help desk and we distribute Dell pc's to the employees throughout the country. Check the front of the laptop after pressing the power button to see if any lights blink. Sometimes there will be a light that blinks once or twice letting you know the issue. I have swapped out many batteries and hard drives in their products. Give these battery tips others have suggested a shot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have a Dell employee come to our office frequently due to bad motherboards and batteries. If you see it charging, and it still wont power on, more than likely you may have a motherboard issue. At least this is the common issue I see with Dells. But to be honest, we distribute Latitude 5470's and 5480's and not Inspiron. So the hardware inside is very different.

    "post": "[Hiren's Boot CD Website](http://www.hirensbootcd.org/)\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI see that there are many helpful, kind, and talented techs here doing a great job of solving many problems, so I am hoping to launch a pre-emptive strike of helpfulness :P  \n\nFirst a quick background - I have worked with IT for about 7 1/2 years now professionally (1 1/2 teaching) so I've seen many BSODs, password resets, Outlook errors (control+right-click on the taskbar icon is a miracle worker), and just about any other help desk, family emergency, server, and network type issue you can imagine.  \n\nThat said, here is why I recommend you add Hiren's to your toolkit immediately:\n\n1. Hiren's is free (as in beer)\n\n2. It is loaded with all kinds of helpful apps.  I like to call it the Swiss army knife of troubleshooting.  Check [here](http://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd) to see some of the awesome apps it has.  For starters, you have: \n\n* Multiple Antivirus/Antispyware/Antimalware/AntiRootkit apps \n* A few file recovery apps for when you accidentally delete data (I used Recuva to recover approx 1TB of data for a friend)\n* Many backup applications\n* Troubleshooting utilities like \"The troubleshooter\", memtest, Maxtor PowerMax and WD Data Lifeguard, etc etc\n\n3. You boot from it, and not Windows.  This means no issues with BSODs, and you don't have to worry about viruses running in the background.  Ridding yourself of viruses and spy/ad/malware becomes much easier with this tool.\n\n4. I mentioned ridding yourself of viruses above - in my opinion the best way to prevent that issue in the first place is to do regular backups of your data (terabyte drives are going down in price) and use Hirens to create an image of your newly installed OS.  Using Hiren's, do the following: \n\n* Back your data up\n* DBAN the computer\n* Install your OS of choice \n* Create a second partition of about 40 Gigs to be safe (this will store your OS and any apps that you want to have installed)\n* Create an image with Clonezilla or Ghost.  \n\nCongratulations, now repairing your PC when/if you get a virus is as easy as restoring your image!\n\n5.  You can boot to \"Mini Windows\".  Now you don't need to fumble around in DOS, trying to figure out why NTLDR is missing - you can just boot to Mini Windows and run the NTLDR fix app.\n\n6.  There are really too many examples of why Hiren's is helpful to list here, but hopefully you get the idea.  Hiren's is a tool that empowers you, the user, and anyone else that you give a copy to.  I personally know many friends and family members that have thanked me profusely because of how easily they were able to boot Hirens and fix their pop up issues, or troubleshoot a failing memory stick.\n\n\nSo anyways, I hope you found that helpful.  If you have any questions I would be happy to address them.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone who checked out this post and provided helpful tips and conversation - as you may have noticed from the formatting nightmare above I am quite new to posting on Reddit (just over a day now).  \n\nI will be around this subreddit to help out though, so hopefully you all will see more posts of a similar nature from me in the not too distant future (free software I think will be my next goal).  I've gotta get to bed for work tomorrow, but I did want to say thanks again, I never expected to see 60 upvotes so quickly :D",

Problems arise when I play more graphically demanding games, the only ones I've had a problem with were Killing Floor 2 and Dark Souls 3.\n       Killing floor 2 would shut off my laptop much quicker, and has a graphics options for gibs/fluids.

Not exactly...\n        Dark souls 3 is a different beast it would seem. It tends to take much longer to cause the laptop to shut off, regardless of what i change the graphics settings to (normally at least a couple hours, sometimes as little as 20 minutes).\n        I have played Monster Hunter World on it only once for a couple hours on medium settings, and never had any issues whatsoever. I have also updated my bios to the most current one, and have also tried undervolting my cpu. Anyone have any suggestions?

This lowered my max clock speed of my cpu to 2.2 ghz, and has kept the temperature slightly cooler than what it normally is.

The CAT cable that connects to wall socket splits into two. one connector connects to the WAN port and the other to one of the LAN ports.\n\nI can't understand why would they do this? If I pull out the either one of the cable, the internet doesn't work anymore.\n\nI would like to use my own gigabit router with WAP, how can I do it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit (update): Thanks for all the help guys. I still unfortunately can't figure it out completely yet. I was told by the person who manages the building that I can't access the 'other side' of the network (patch panel etc). This is the way it is setup and I must use it like that.  To be honest she is a purely non-technical person and she is annoyed if the internet is working then what is the problem. The internet is included in the rent. The building doesn't have any other cable etc provider. This is in Far east asia. \n\n1. When I disconnect the cable on the LAN port, all the devices are obviously still connected but the internet is not accessible. However I still get assigned a DHCP ip address. \n2. The device is a router + WAP + switch.  The split cable is definitely not ending any where in my apartment (as far as I can tell). Wifi is via SSID provided by this router and there is no other AP. \n3. When I connect my laptop to one of the LAN ports, I get 192.168.1.x IP address. [192.168.1.1](https://192.168.0.1) resolves to this local router in my apartment. The router user name / password isn't know to me. Typical combinations of admin user root don't work. \n4. When I connect the router's WAN and the wall RJ45 socket with a normal Ethernet cable, the router WAN light turns ON When I connect my laptop to one of LAN ports, the connection is made but all I can do is pull up the webUI for this router. I can't access the wider internet. \n5. When I connect the laptop directly to the RJ45 connector for the WAN port. I don't get an IP address DHCP. I tried to set static IP address 192.168.0.x or 192.168.1.x or 10.0.0.x but it doesn't seem that anything is on these subnets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/S9JgBeK](https://imgur.com/a/S9JgBeK)",

Otherwise there would have only been the single wall jack connection.",

They should send a techie or someone with access to the other end of that cable to terminate it properly. At the very least, get a router capable of using VLAN's to isolate that 'required' LAN port so that it can't interfere or see what you're doing on the network, then use a VPN.",
      "Although you may want to ask management to explain first, I would go directly to your ISP and request that they come by to look it. In most cases they are responsible for ensuring a connection for each customer. You could explain the setup on the phone but ultimately you could tell them that you can't connect when you plug into the WAN port and leave the whole weird LAN connection requirement out of it. They may bore you with getting you to troubleshoot remotely but in the end they should send a tech. They don't want anyone hijacking service as much as you do and may be able to run a whole new line.",
      "It\u2019s clearly feeding Internet to some device, maybe they have a monitor to detect when it goes down? Or do they need access to the router settings for some reason?\n\nI\u2019d honestly ask because that would concern me greatly.",
      "Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps) only needs 4 wires to transmit and receive data. And Ethernet cable has 8. So technically you could use one cable to wire 2 ports and both could technically transfer up to 100 Mbps. To reach 1 Gbps speeds you need to use 8 wires or 1 entire cat5e cable per port. \n\nEdit. If whomever did this run didn't want to run multiple wires ( people cheap out on these things) they could get away with things like this. Imagine when broadband became common. Like the max you could get was maybe 25Mbps. Why would someone bother running multiple cables if 1 could handle that speed easily?",
      "Allow me to propose something I haven't seen yet.\n\nThe two connected ports are bridged.  There is a proxy or something similar down one end (your routers default gateway).  The other cable goes to the default gateway of THAT router.  \n\nWhen you disconnect either cable, you also break the bridge, which is why you lose internet when you remove either cable.\n\nThis could be malicious or just poorly configured.\n\nIf you have a spare ethernet switch you can test this scenario - connect both cables going to your WAN/Lan to your spare switch, then run a single new cable to the WAN port on your box.  See if you have internet then.\n\nAlso, I have seen plenty of applications where appliances such as what you have contain custom silicon and/or software put in some generic case without relabeling the housing to save costs - no guarantee lan/wan are actually working as such or even necessarily ethernet at all.",
      "Ok. So the only way I can figure this out is to see where the other end is terminated. But from this I can assume that the ISP device is at the other end and another ethernet device is there and being fed off this router. Whomever did this has a working knowledge of network topology as not your average Joe would know that you can split pairs like that and know pins 1,2,3 and 6 run it. So it really doesn't make sense that if you unplug the LAN port, the internet goes out, unless its wifi that it kills. If so, then 100% the LAN port is feeding a WAP.

It's very odd you can't remove the card unless it's integrated into the CPU or motherboard.  If it's a card then it's removable assuming it's not soldered on for some crazy reason.  If it's one of these cases, there's almost always a disable option in the BIOS.\n\nAs others have said... Some motherboards have clips on the port to hold it in place and you may need a way to move the tab or lever or push down before lifting.  Obviously remove any screws holding it in place (also be mindful of adjacent screws or plates holding it down (I've had tha happen a few times) .... in a few cases (especially on pre-builts) I've had to remove other cards first or even the whole motherboard with graphics attached to get underneath the larger fan/heatsinks on modern graphics cards to be able to reach under it and release the clip holding it down.

The ports are REALLY similar. Phone jack is called RJ-11 and ethernet jack is called RJ-45. Here's a great [page](https://www.diffen.com/difference/RJ11_vs_RJ45) comparing the two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought this was a joke post at first, but I quickly realized that old phone jacks are just going to cause more and more confusion as we move away from land lines. Kinda neat, actually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still remember the color order for the cables from college: orange-white, orange, green-white, blue, blue-white, green, brow-white, brown.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore fun facts: You can buy spools of Cat 6 cable, ethernet ends, and a crimper, and make your own cables for a small fraction of what they cost at the store.

Is you need to have a network connection from one room to another that \"may\" be possible however if I were to make an assumption I'd say you're in an apartment building, in which case the wiring is likely set up in series. the other jacks and wherever else the wiring in building goes will heavily impact you network connection without a deep dive into how things are laid out.\n\nJust be careful with what you do.",

Hopefully this is the correct sub to post in but please don't hesitate to tell me if there is a better place to take this issue.\n\nI first discovered the issue when I happened to use my dad's laptop to print something out. I noticed that the taskbar looked a bit strange, with one extra row than normal. Upon closer inspection I noticed that there was a message that read: \"Computer help 1-855-816-3635.\" I googled the number and immediately realized that he was scammed. There is also a Notepad file on the desktop that is titled \"COMPUTER HELP,\" and include the same phone number along with the the names \"Safe Tech Solutions,\" and \"InfraGraph Solution.\" A quick google search reveals that these are indeed scammer organizations.\n\nMy dad's recollection of the event is not perfect as it happened several months ago, but he recalls that there was an issue with his computer, he then spoke to these people on the phone, gave them remote access, and payed them by giving his credit card information over the phone. He claims that they \u201cfixed the problem.\u201d I am assuming that it was just one of those popups that forces you to call a number and then \u201cfixes\u201d the problem after taking your money and just clearing the browser window.\n\nSince this happened several months ago, I want to believe that the damage is done and all they were after was the \u201ctech support fee\u201d they collected from my dad over the phone. However, since they had remote access to his computer I am worried that there might be keyloggers or trojans of some kind that would allow them to steal more sensitive information that would lead to serious identity theft or threat to financial wellbeing.\n\nAs of right now I have his laptop in front of me and I am writing this post from my own desktop. I have somewhat of a plan for how to resolve the issue. The wi-fi is turned off on the laptop. I would like to go through and make sure that there is no strange software on the computer. At first glance I cannot find anything. He already had GotoMeeting and another Cisco applications on his computer so I can\u2019t say with certainty how the scammers gained access.

    "post": "Hello!\n\nWhile I was playing a game on Steam, a player on the enemy team added me to his friends list. He then sent me a voice call, which I foolishly accepted. Shortly after I accepted the call, the player started to spam my IP and general location in the chat. Minutes later, my ping rose to 999 and my internet became unusably slow. I verified that he did in fact have my correct IP using xmyip. This is especially frustrating, because I have a subscription to NordVPN, but I haven't been using it recently in games :l\n\nI immediately called my ISP (fucking TWC) and explained the situation. They told me that they cannot manually change my IP, but it should automatically change in \"around four days or so\". Although she didn't seem certain that it would actually change in four days.\n\nIn the mean time, is there anything I can do to protect myself?\n",

      "Tons of bad advice in this thread. I work for an ISP (not yours). Our DHCP leases are 7 days. There is a concept of half life, if the DHCP server doesn't hear from your device in  half the lease timer the lease will expire. In our case 3.5 days then it would lose its DHCP reservation and get a new IP address. 7day leases are pretty common although every provider can set their leases time to whatever they want. However unplug your modem for 10 minutes or an hour is unlikely to do anything. I'd wager the minimum timer for almost any DHCP lease is 24 hours.\n\nOne other thing to understand the DHCP lease isn't assigned to the modem but the equipment connected to it or if it is an all in one device the router that is part of it. \n\nThe solution is to go into your router settings and you should see an option to clone a MAC address. This will let your router copy the MAC of your PC Xbox etc so it will present a new MAC to your ISPs DHCP server and thus get a new MAC address. After you clone the MAC you may need to power cycle your modem.",

    "post": "EDIT 1/14: **Clarification:** The ISO you're writing directly to the drive in step 11 is a Linux live environment. It should work with any Debian based live distro that supports persistence. I used Ubuntu 10.04 LTS so I don't have to worry about future upgrades as often.\n\nEDIT 1/13: ~~For the lazy, [here's an image of the drive](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/ofvv2/my_usb_drive_contains_rescue_tools_persistent/c3h1q5r). It's not confirmed working by anyone, and a torrent was the only option for distribution.~~ Once I have the complete 32GB version created I'll make proper images for both 16 and 32GB sizes with proper uploads. **My image got corrupted in my VM before I could seed it to 1.0. ~~I'll get a new one up ASAP.~~ I'm not going to make another image until I get the 32G drive working. I may look like I've abandoned this but I haven't. I'm just very busy.**\n\n----\n\nI thought I'd write up a quick little run down on how to do this, since it took me about two weeks of tinkering and reading to get this working right and no one around here seemed to know the answers to my questions when I asked.\n\n**The problem:** There are many many tools for creating multi boot USB drives. Not a single one I could find supported persistent environments. Creating a persistent environment then adding things like Trinity or UBCD to GRUB was rather trivial, but I also wanted a Windows 7 installer and recovery console. This is not so trivial it seems.\n\n**My finished solution:** What I ended up doing was creating a separate partition at the end of the drive and copying the ISO contents for fast booting into my persistent environment. Then I created a FAT32 partition at the beginning of the drive to install other bootable environments on using YUMI. I created a universal Win 7 installer using WinAIO for YUMI to install on my drive removing the issue of tweaking GRUB or syslinux manually to get a Windows install to boot.\n\nThis guide assumes a bit of technical knowledge and that you know your way around the Linux CLI.\n\n##Skip to here for the actual instructions. You'll need at least a 16GB drive to mirror my exact setup.\n\n###First things first: Get your Win 7 universal ISO set up.\n\n1. Download the Windows 7 [x86](http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-59463.iso) and [x64](http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-59465.iso) ISOs. (These downloads are from Digital River who officially contracts with MS. These downloads are as safe as you can get without purchasing a copy).\n\n2. Download [WinAIO](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/29178-WinAIO-Maker-Professional-The-All-in-One-Windows-Setup-Solution).\n\n3. Click the AutoAIO button in the lower right corner.\n\n4. Select a target folder where you'd like your ISO to be saved to in the first box. Select the X86 (59463) and X64 (59465) ISOs in their respective boxes and choose `Enable x64 recovery mode`.\n\n5. Click Start Compilation.\n\nWhat you should be left with is an ISO that when booted will allow you to choose any version of Windows 7 from Starter to Ultimate in 32 or 64 bit formats, except where they're not available (there is no 64 bit version of Starter edition). This also includes the EU versions that ship without WMP, denoted by an N after the name.\n\nSet that ISO aside for now, it's time to format your USB drive and work on your persistent install.\n\n###Formatting your USB drive:\n\nI did this using the Linux CLI in an Ubuntu VM because it's faster for me. It's possible to do using Windows tools but I'm going to stick strictly to the instructions I've tested personally. If someone would like to make a Windows version of this, feel free.\n\nI did this using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.\n\n1. With your drive plugged in, run `sudo fdisk -l` and find your USB drive. For this guide we're going to assume it's `/dev/sdb`\n\n2. Run cfdisk to partition the drive. `sudo cfdisk /dev/sdb`\n\n3. Delete all partitions. Create a new primary partition at the beginning of the drive using the entire drive minus 730MB.\n\n4. Create a new primary partition using the remaining space.\n\n5. Select the larger partition and set it to type FAT32 (option 0C)\n\n6. Write the new partition table and quit.\n\n7. Format the first partition as FAT32: `sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 -c /dev/sdb1`\n\n8. Mount the newly formatted partition: `sudo mkdir -p /media/USB` then `sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/USB`\n\n9. Create your persistent file to save changes. `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/USB/casper-rw bs=1M count=4095`. 4095 being the size of the persistent file in MB. You can set this to whatever you like under the 4GB FAT32 file size limit depending on the size of your drive.\n\n10. Create a file system in your persistent file. `sudo mkfs.ext4 -F /media/USB/casper-rw`\n\n11. Write your (Linux live distro) ISO image to the extra partition. `sudo dd if=/path/to/iso.iso of=/dev/sdb2`. This will take a while.\n\nNow that your drive is set up, we need to back up a few files. These instructions are for moving files out of the ISO to the FAT32 partition. After extracting them you need to back them up elsewhere. Your FAT32 partition is going to be formatted again when we get back to Windows.\n\n1. `sudo mkdir -p /mnt/iso`\n\n2. `sudo mount -o loop /path/to/iso.iso /mnt/iso`\n\n3. `cp /mnt/iso/casper/{vmlinuz,initrd.lz} /media/USB/`\n\n4. `sudo umount /mnt/iso`\n\n5. `sudo rmdir /mnt/iso`\n\nBefore pulling the USB drive from the Linux machine or VM, run `sync`.\n\nNow go back to Windows and copy `casper-rw`, `vmlinuz` and `initrd.lz` to your HDD for safe keeping. You're going to need them later.\n\n###Creating your YUMI drive:\n\n1. Download and start up [YUMI](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/).\n\n2. Select your USB drive letter from the pulldown menu.\n\n3. Scroll to the bottom of the list and choose *\"Windows Vista/7 Installer\"*. Find the ISO you created with WinAIO and click *Create*.\n\n4. After this operation is complete, find where you saved your casper-rw, vmlinuz and initrd.lz files. Copy casper-rw to the root of the partition and vmlinuz and initrd.lz to /boot.\n\n5. Download GRUB.exe from [here](http://www.icpug.org.uk/national/linnwin/step1-9x.htm) and save it to /boot/grub.\n\n6. Create a new file in /boot/grub named menu.lst with the following contents:\n\n        default\t\t0\n        timeout\t\t0\n\n        title\t\tUbuntu 10.04\n        root\t\t(hd0,0)\n        kernel\t\t/boot/vmlinuz boot=casper file=/preseed/ubuntu.seed persistent\n        initrd\t\t/boot/initrd.lz\n\n7. Find `syslinux.cfg` in the multiboot folder in the root of the drive and open it in a text editor. Add the following after the `label Boot from first Hard Drive` entry: (Not directly after that line, but after the `MENU DEFAULT` line in that block of text)\n\n        label Ubuntu\n        KERNEL /boot/grub/grub.exe\n        MENU INDENT 1\n        APPEND \u2013-config-file=/boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nAfter saving these two files, you should have a functioning bootable USB drive that will boot any Windows 7 installer, plus a persistent Ubuntu environment that you can install packages and save system setting changes on.\n\nReboot with the USB drive in to test it out. Boot into your Ubuntu environment and create a file on the desktop. Reboot back into the Ubuntu environment to make sure it stuck. After you've confirmed your persistence is working properly, boot into the Windows installer and make your way through until you get to the HDD partition screen to make sure that's working as intended as well.\n\nAfter you've confirmed that the basics are working as they should, you can use YUMI to install other ISOs that will be automatically added to the menu. I'm running Hiren's, UBCD, Trinity Rescue Kit, Backtrack 5 and Kaspersky's bootable AV. Don't bother with things like Kon-boot or memtest86 in YUMI if you have a rescue environment loaded up. They render them redundant.\n\nIf you don't like the segregated menus like me, you can open up your /multiboot/syslinux.cfg file to customize it. If the menu entry isn't in the main menu it will point to the config file containing it.\n\nFor example, if you want the Windows 7 installer on the main menu instead of under \"Other operating systems\", open /multiboot/menu/other.cfg.

I upgraded to a Vega 64 in my PC a couple of weeks ago and have since hit the sweetspot with settings, getting a score of ~5000 on Superposition's Extreme benchmark.\n\n--\n\nYesterday night I loaded up Rocket League and tried to find a game then noticed my fps was tanked. Same with CS:GO and a few others, but not every game in my Steam Library.  \n\n--\nIt's been 144hz/fps max settings since I upgraded and never moves from that in games, but I noticed it was capping itself at ~69 fps. The weirdest part is that my controller input can adjust it.  [Moving the sticks can raise the FPS cap, as seen here.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDHNfREwfOM) I double checked my AMD wattman settings and couldn't find anything so I tried a different game, same thing. It's capped at ~69 in a few Steam games but not all of them. Mad Max didn't have the cap, same with WoW and Shadow of Mordor. \n\nUpon loading into the certain games that cap the FPS, I hear a distinct sound. Surely this has something to do with whatever is running and killing performance. You can hear it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3NcrxCGLoM\n\n--\n\nAt this point I've tried looking through every menu, setting list, background program, etc. in AMD's software and Windows and can't figure it out.

      "Here's an explanation of what happened:\n\nRadeon Chill is a driver feature designed to limit power consumption and heat output when playing games.  While you're not interacting with the game, it decreases the max framerate to decrease the load on the GPU.  When you move your thumbsticks or press buttons on your controller, Radeon Chill recognizes that you're interacting with the game and increases or removes the framerate limit.\n\nIt's a feature, not a bug.

      "I'm seeing several people here claiming that the odds of actually falling victim to cybercrime after some random person unwittingly gains access to your data is fairly low, and while I tend to agree with that sentiment, the key point here is the assumption that the person who bought the computer was just some average well-meaning person looking for a used PC. \n\nWithout wanting to cause too much alarm in this case, especially since we don't know the details of the sale, I think OP and others should be aware that there are people who intentionally go around crawling craigslist, ebay, garage sales, public auctions, etc. looking for hardware with intact or poorly wiped drives from which personal data can be recovered and either used, or sold to third parties on the dark web for various usually nefarious purposes. These individuals also very often target elderly or inexperienced sellers, and have very developed methods for sniffing out likely sources of valuable data. \n\nAs someone with over a decade of IT work experience for government, business, and non-commercial clients, I have lost track of how often I've personally purchased or inherited old workstations and servers that still had everything from personal family photos and banking information to accounting and payroll data left on their drives. \n\nJust to give an example of how easy it is to overlook data leaks, I was recently tasked with a data recovery job on a 1TB drive that was hit with ransomware. I knew for a fact that this drive had at least three previous owners. One who used it in a home PC, another who inherited it and used it in a test environment, and the third owner swapped it into their small business server to replace a burned out drive. When it was installed in the server, it was originally given Server 2012, then about a year later it experienced two successive formats during a Server 2016 upgrade. During my data recovery attempt I was still able to find several files from the original home PC owner, including the archives of their iTunes library, as well as personal files that were synced from the second owner's Microsoft account when they used it for testing.\n\nFor future reference, I highly recommend either pulling, swapping, or zeroing out the hard drives of any computer hardware anyone intends to relinquish control of.\n\nTL;DR: It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you.",

You should never do anything on any device that is owned by school/work that is questionable and you do not want them to see and do not use any secure communications you do not want the public to see (i.e. never access your bank info while on a corporate owned device).\n\nIf they made you install a bunch of software on your computer as part of the 'set-up' process for school, then again, it is possible. However, I would highly recommend researching and doing your best to quarantine any software installed from work/school on a personal device. Enterpise-y tech departments usually want to know more than they should and do not always care the most about security (not saying this is bad and all of them are insecure, but you should just be very cautious of software they ask you to install on personal devices).\n\nIf they require you to use a VPN, also possible (some type of special extra \"login\" you have to do to access any Web page or software related to school). A VPN routes all of your Internet traffic through a server they own and have control over. So they can see all of the URLs you access and any page you load that is not HTTPS.\n\nIf none of the three are true, than they are either not accessing your data, or if they are, it is most likely being done illegally via some type of malware (security protections in modern browsers stop Web pages from accessing any of this data and it should not be possible).

This is not 24/7 monitoring. \n\nNow, I have NO idea how they would accomplish that, but it seems like a very easy way to get around this would be to access those sites while on your phone. If the idea is to prevent cheating, they are doing it incorrectly.\n\nFAR more worrying is how much information is able to be monitored through this method and what kind of security they are implementing.

I have to see those app icons no matter what, I have to scroll through them wasting my time no matter what?\n\nNot to mention, say I am watching a movie and now it suddenly is slow, well that is because an app I do not want is updating in the background while I am trying to watch Netflix. These app companies have access to my TV, all of them, and I can not stop it just because samsung got money to put the apps on the TV? We know how often hacks happen and as a smart TV is has credit information and more about me. I do not trust a couple dozen random companies to never abuse my data, much less why should facebook know what I watch?\nI was told by samsung if I do not like the apps to buy an older TV that does not have this option, but it has less specs as well, this is not reasonable to me.\n\n**Long story short, can I jailbreak the TV or remove the unwanted apps in any way?** I just can not keep a $1200 piece of equipment that I do not even get to control the software. . . .please help. . . .",

I already tried to  re-install the drivers again with version 19.7.1, no difference\n\n\\- No  wattman modifications have been made when i tested these games.

    "post": "Hi All,\n\nI just upgraded to Windows 10 last night. Everything went great, except all media in Google Chrome (YouTube, Pandora, HTML5, etc) has choppy, glitchy sounding audio. I spent hours trying to debug this problem. Many users suggest disabling the built in Flash player in Chrome://Plugins, however, this did not work for me.\n\nThe fix ended up being simple. I had to add the argument --audio-buffer-size=2048 to the Chrome launch shortcut.\n\nYou do this by right-clicking your Chrome shortcut. Then select 'Properties'. In the 'Target' field, you should see the path to your Chrome executable. (Similar to \"C:\\Users\\UserName\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome SxS\\Application\\chrome.exe\")\n\nPaste this text AFTER the closing quotation marks at the end of the path:  --audio-buffer-size=2048\n\nYour 'Target' field should now look like this (\"C:\\Users\\UserName\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome SxS\\Application\\chrome.exe\" --audio-buffer-size=2048)\n\nThis should fix any audio stuttering in Chrome!\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nIf this fix doesn't work for you, or you are having a similar issue in different application (League of Legends, Steam, etc.) there is another possible fix. You will need to adjust the bitrate of your audio playback device. To do this, follow these steps:\n\nRight-click the speaker icon in you taskbar (next to the clock) and select 'Playback Devices'.\n\nFind your default playback device. It should be the one with the green checkmark by it. You can right-click this device and click 'Test' to ensure it is the right one. Right-click this device and select 'Properties'.\n\nA 'Speakers Properties' window should now pop up. You want to click on the 'Advanced' tab in this window.\n\nIn the 'Advanced' tab, there is a 'Default Format' section. In this section is a dropdown box for your bitrate. The options in here look something like '16 bit, 48000hz (DVD Quality)'. Try out each and every option in this drop-down menu. This changes the playback quality of your audio, but may correct the issue we are seeing. Be sure to click 'Apply' after making a change, and then restart the application you are having audio problems with.\n\nBe sure to report back if this fix works for you, and what setting you chose!\n\nEDIT 2 (8/16/15):\n\nHi all,\nI've still had intermittent problems over the last few weeks. I tried running Google Chrome Canary (the dev version of Chrome with the latest updates). No change at first, but this morning I had a Chrome update that seems to have resolved all problems... Not sure what changed, but I no longer need the command line fixes, and all audio is working great. May have been a Window's update, or the Chrome update. If you would like to try it out, here is the link:\nhttps://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html\n\n\n",

I will start up my computer, and it will be fine for however long I am on it for (which is usually for a while, since I play video games all day mostly).

I'll be moving, shooting, building, and everything else at around 1.2x speed, and the server will realize that I'm moving too fast and teleport me back to compensate. This happens around every second. There is also a game that I play that doesn't have too good of an anti-cheat or something similar, so it doesn't teleport me back, giving me a huge unfair advantage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI looked this issue up, and didn't see anything on games running too fast, but about the clock moving too fast.

(You can try to map your own IP address here.) At its least precise, it can be mapped only to a country. In order to deal with that imprecision, MaxMind decided to set default locations at the city, state and country level for when it knows only roughly where the IP address lives. If it knows only that an IP address is somewhere in the U.S., and can't figure out anything more about where it is, it will point to the center of the country.\n\n>As any geography nerd knows, the precise center of the United States is in northern Kansas, near the Nebraska border. Technically, the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates of the center spot are 39\u00b050\u2032N 98\u00b035\u2032W. In digital maps, that number is an ugly one: 39.8333333,-98.585522. So back in 2002, when MaxMind was first choosing the default point on its digital map for the center of the U.S., it decided to clean up the measurements and go with a simpler, nearby latitude and longitude: 38\u00b0N 97\u00b0W or 38.0000,-97.0000.\n\nAs a result, for the last 14 years, every time MaxMind's database has been queried about the location of an IP address in the United States it can't identify, it has spit out the default location of a spot two hours away from the geographic center of the country. This happens a lot: 5,000 companies rely on MaxMind's IP mapping information, and in all, there are now over 600 million IP addresses associated with that default coordinate. If any of those IP addresses are used by a scammer, or a computer thief, or a suicidal person contacting a help line, MaxMind's database places them at the same spot: 38.0000,-97.0000.\n\nThe reason I bring up this possibility is that [Center, ND is the geographical center of North America](https://www.popsci.com/center-north-america-is-town-called-center-no-this-not-joke);  It could be a similar defaulting issue.",

Everything is back up and running great, guessed I got some new upgrades while trying to figure out the cheapest part of the system was the problem :p Thanks for all the suggestions and help guys! \n\nEdit 2: Took it in to Microcenter today, will be hearing something back by Wednesday. Fingers crossed that it's a simple fix.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the replies guys, I really appreciate it. If I haven't answered your question, chances are I've answered it somewhere else or I've tried what you suggested. I'm planning on calling Gigabyte support tomorrow and if that doesn't get me anywhere I might just have to take it in for repair at Micro Center or something. (Not really something I can afford but running out of options.) I'll be sure to keep you guys updated if it works out and try to answer some more questions. \n\nSo I had a classic water accident and after drying out for a day my PC would turn on, all fans would spin, but it wouldn't post. After powering on, it restarts immediately, then stays on for about 15 seconds before restarting again, while never giving my any BIOS or post. The only way to stop the loop is to switch the power off on the PSU itself. After extensive troubleshooting I decided to go ahead and upgrade my motherboard and processor as they were a likely culprit. After they arrived, no dice, same issue. I made extra sure I was following all installation steps correctly. I borrowed some new RAM to see if that was the issue and still the same problem. I had tested the voltages of my 500W power supply and they all looked fine, but I swapped in a new 600W just in case. After no luck, I took my rig in to Geek Squad and they said the only thing the could think of was a problem with the case itself. I ordered a new case, installed all the components to the best of my ability and, you guessed it, same exact problem. Before you ask, I've tried reseating components multiple times, and I've tried resetting CMOS. I'm at my wit's end at this point as I'm now falling behind on a lot of school projects as I am a full time online college student, so any ideas for solutions would be great. \n\n \n\nOLD SPECS\n\nGigabyte GA H110M-H\n\ni3-6100\n\nMicro GeForce GTX 1050 Ti \n\nBallistix 16 GB RAM (one stick) \n\n1 TB HDD\n\nEVGA 500w \n\n \n\nNEW SPECS\n\nGigabyte B360M DS3H\n\ni3 8100\n\nMicro GeForce GTX 1050 Ti \n\nBallistix 16 GB RAM (Tried corsair 16 GB, two sticks)\n\n1 TB HDD\n\nEVGA 600W",

Break into your Teamviewer Account -- username is your password, and maybe you used that same password on something else compromised, or maybe they just guessed  \n2.

How they connected that with your TV ID#, I don't know.  \n3. Random password on TV -- by random chance they found a working 9-digit TV ID and somehow beat the password.  TV slows attempts way down, so this is a bit unlikely, unless they've found a way to test TV clients without using a TV client themselves; I hope Teamviewer would detect and interrupt those kinds of brute-force requests on their network of clients. \n\n1 and 2 require some kind of personal information while 3 does not.  That does not mean it's a personal attack, only that your personal info is likely out there somewhere along with some passwords.  It's most likely #1.  Change your TV Account password and enable 2FA using Google Authenticator or similar.   \n\nAlso, disable the random password and set a complicated permanent password, which you only store in a Password Manager.  Ideally, use one that never shows you the password on the screen.

The only safe way to recover data on a lost hard drive is to operate the disk while it's in a Read-Only mode.

Plug the drive into one of the free sata ports on another machine and then launch GetDataBack. There is an option for your situation, having reinstalled Windows. Make sure to select the right disk and select that option and then do a scan.\n\nIt will try and recreate the files it can, you can also search through the recovered files. This is your best chance. If you only reinstalled Windows and didn't install a lot of other programs or copy a lot of data to the drive afterwards you'll have better luck. Basically you're hoping that the location on the drive that had these files wasn't overwritten yet. If not you actually have a good chance at recovery. \n\nIf you can't recover the files you can use a service like [Drive Savers](https://www.drivesaversdatarecovery.com/), as long as you tell them exactly which files you want to recover they will only charge you if they recover those files. That being said these services are expensive, think $1,000+. \n\nGood luck. ",

The utility helpfully has a \"click here to install\" button, the patch is downloaded and starts to run.  A few seconds later a dialogue box pops up notifying me of a \"VERIFY ERROR\".  The machine is still working so I was able to check for previous reports and they aren't good: everybody who has seen this message pop up during the BIOS update has been unable to reboot the system.  No post codes, no bios entry screens, no nothing - just black screens on power up.  Toshiba has been receiving these reports for many months now but continue to actively notify people that they should flash their BIOS.\n\nSo far I've gone through only round one of phone calls to get this fixed.  I called Toshiba's Customer Support Center (800-457-7777) and was given a case number and told to call Toshiba Repair Services at 800-438-3910 because the first center couldn't help me.  Other people have reported that shipping was expected to be picked up by the end user, time will tell what they will require from me.\n\nIn the meantime, while you may have no problems with the update I strongly urge you to think twice about updating your Toshiba laptop BIOS even if they tell you to do so.",

Turns out the first tech didn't know what he was talking about and punted the case away to a department that can't look up ticket numbers, can't do anything under warranty and won't really discuss anything until you promise to pay.\n\nThat guy transferred me back to the same department I spoke with this morning.  He apologized for the wrong information that the first guy gave me.  He tells me this is covered under warranty but I have to pay to ship my laptop in and can expect it back in 10 business days + time to ship.  Other than my sending in the laptop to be de-bricked no charges.  Annoying, but not worth going postal over.\n",

The CPU is at 100% constantly - at the moment Service Host: Local System is taking up the most with 60ish percent but before things like wsappx, WMI Provider Host and a few others I can't remember were taking up the most. I used the Group Policy Editor to disable the Windows Store and so now wsappx isn't taking up so much but the CPU is still constantly at 100%!! I've also tried running Windows Update Troubleshooter but it said there was nothing wrong but then later apparently some things couldn't update?

I let the \"preparing to install\" get to 100% before restarting. \n\nI really never had this problem before and I don't know what to do.

      "disclaimer:  I don't own a Mac and never have.  \n  \n>So, my ALL of my backed up data is possibly (probably) corrupted.  \n  \nNo, it isn't.  The only thing that might be corrupted is whatever file the drive was handling at the moment it was disconnected.  If it was idle then everything on the drive should be shiney.  \n  \nThe first thing I would do is find a partition recovery tool for Mac.  It shouldn't be hard to find a few free demo or trial versions.  The sudden disconnect may have borked the partition which is why the drive isn't detected anymore.  Imagine all your backed up data is in a single book and your brother took that book and scribbled on the front so that you can't read it anymore.  Now imagine that you're a computer and when you see this newly-mangled book you think, \"Well, I can't read the cover so I'm going to assume there's nothing inside there.\"  That''s a little like what I think has happened to your drive.  A partition tool can repair this kind of damage.  \n\nI just did some Googling and apparently Mac comes with a disk utility.  I would start there.  \n  \nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/212836/how-to-use-your-macs-disk-utility-to-partition-wipe-repair-restore-and-copy-drives/  \n  \nI would connect the drive and then run this utility.  If it detects the drive use the First Aid option and see if it is able to repair the partition.  Be very careful before you start any other operations with this utility.  \n  \nIf the utility doesn't detect the drive then it's time to look for a different solution.  \n  \n**[edit]**  \nI see some replies urging OP to use RAID or cloud storage to avoid this.  Imho I wouldn't use either.  With cloud storage you're giving up control of your data to gain the *expectation* that it will always be available.  I don't mean 'big brother' control, I mean that your data could become unavailable at any moment for reasons beyond your control and it may become unavailable at a crucial moment or it may vanish forever.  The hosting company could go under and take down their servers without notice.  The cloud drive(s) holding your data could fail for a variety of reasons or be ruined by a natural disaster or poor maintenance or whatever other natural or human-caused mess could happen and you won't know that anything is wrong until you try to get into your account and your browser starts laughing at you.  And finally you could lose your internet connection for an extended period.  I'm not arguing to not use cloud storage at all.  I'm saying to not use it exclusively.\n  \nRAID is more defensible but as a casual user I'm still not a fan.  It's complex to set up, the drives are always on and it's relatively expensive.  One of my build goals that I finally accomplished last year was to rid my case of HDDs.  But I didn't toss my old drives.  I turned them into offline storage/backup.  \n  \nhttp://imgur.com/a/sINvj  \n  \nThat's an external dock and two 4TB HDDs.  Both drives are storage; I use another one for music and software and then another for Steam backup so if something happens to my games drives I won't have to spend an eternity re-downloading everything.  When I want to use a drive, whether to add to it or watch/use something on it, I connect the dock, plug the drive into the dock and then switch on the power.  When I'm done I unmount the drive, switch off the dock power and then put both the dock and the drive in the bags they came in and put them on a shelf.  My data is always literally within reach and nothing short of a power failure can cut me off from it.  \nThe dock's bag keeps dust out, the HDDs' bags keep dust out and offer anti-static protection.  The drives themselves don't go more than a few months at most between uses.  They are no longer being repeatedly spun up and then parked when I turn my computer on or when some Windows' service like search indexer or whatever else kicks in.  The drives aren't inactive for so long that I have to worry much about atrophy but I certainly have reduced their wear and tear to a fraction of what it was.  I'm hoping to see some spectacular shelf life from them.  \nThe dock cost about $35CDN after tax.  HDD prices have finally started dropping after a 6 year spike.  If you're a casual user who wants a simple and affordable solution that you can be confident about, this is the best setup I know of.  \n  \nI don't use external drives because every time you buy a drive you're buying a dock as well.  I only need one dock so some chunk of every external drive purchase would be throwing money away.  I also see power users in tech forums warning people about reliability problems, although that may just be elitist snobbery.  I'm happy with what I've got and I'll keep doing it until I have a good reason to stop.  \n  \n**[edit2] Ignore this paragraph.  Turns out it's a myth.**  \nAlso, if you decide to try this make sure to store your HDDs on an edge (just like you should be doing with CDs, DVDs and blu-rays).  Disks that are sitting on a spindle for long periods will slowly droop around that spindle.  A disk that isn't flat is a disk that can't be read properly.  Also known as junk.",
      "If you cannot afford to lose the data I would recommend a service to recover the data, as any mistake you make will only compound your problems ",
      "No idea how to recover your data but here's a lecture. \n\nIf your 'backup' drive contains your only copy of this data then it's not a backup at all, it's the primary storage of that data and you don't have a backup. \n\nWhen you *do* get around to backing up your data, as with anything that actually matters, two is one and one is none. Make at least two copies. In separate physical locations if possible i.e. hard drive and in the cloud, or backup drives at home and at school. \n\nGood luck recovering your data. ",

    "post": "So a weird thing happened an hour ago. It actually started yesterday, but unfortunately I didn't give it too much thought until now.\n\nLast night I received an email from rockstar games saying that  someone requested a password change. That was weird, because I haven't used social club in over a year. What's even stranger, the mail was on russian. The first thing I did was change the social club password. When I signed in social club through their website, everything was on russian. I changed it to english and thought everything was fine, maybe it was just a mistake.\n\nFast forward to this morning, I received a notification on my phone saying that Google had prevented someone from signing in to my account. It was someone from russia, so obviously the two attacks are somehow connected. I've changed all of my passwords and enabled two factor authentication. Luckily, they didn't manage to actually log into my mail, so they weren't able to change other passwords (facebook, instagram, paypal, etc...).\n\nNow the thing that is the most mysterious; I missed a phone call from Greece. This is strange because I don't live in Greece, nor do I know someone from Greece. Silent mode was turned on so I didn't hear it ringing and didn't pick up the call, perhaps even better I didn't. At this point I'm not sure if that call is connected to the other attacks, or if it's a completely different thing. Both scenarios sound scary. How the hell did they get my phone number?!\n\nI've attached some screenshots, so you can see the IP address and the phone number. I don't know what else can I do besides change all passwords and enable two factor authentication. I did a virus scan on my laptop, no viruses were found.\n\nI was pretty nervous and scared when I read the notification, as this is the first time something like this happened to me. Why would they target me? I'm just a random dude living his life.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this as well? Are these attacks common?\n\nIP address: [https://i.imgur.com/zhKaCig.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/zhKaCig.jpg)\n\nPhone number: [https://i.imgur.com/eSglaL2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/eSglaL2.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI've found out that they changed the email address for social club, that notification was in the Spam folder, so I saw it just now. Does that mean they really did sign in my email?\n\nScreenshot: [https://i.imgur.com/H0SU8s0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/H0SU8s0.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nIt wasn't a phishing link/website. It was a legit rockstar games link, only in russian. See screenshots.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/uiJkBbz.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/uiJkBbz.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/4WupFqR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4WupFqR.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/DKbRvu3.png](https://i.imgur.com/DKbRvu3.png) \\- see the link it's redirecting me to when I put my cursor over 'choose a new password'\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/059bEbt.png](https://i.imgur.com/059bEbt.png) \\- this is the same when I compare it to a newsletter email from rockstar games\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE 3:\n\nThanks to fellow Greek redditors, u/TichuMaster, u/dead_dr0p and u/xBolt_, I now know that the missed call was from a national postal service in Greece. So the two probably aren't connected. I still don't know why would they call me though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE 4:\n\nSo... this is what I believe has happened. The russians somehow managed to get hold of my email and password for social club, probably a breach. Then, they signed into the account and changed the password. That's when I received the first email, which was still in english. Then, they changed the country, language and email. They've set it all to russian, that's why later emails were on russian. Gmail flagged them as spam because they were in a different language. I didn't react in time, meaning I didn't notice the first email that notified me about a password change. That was the biggest mistake. Once the hackers took control over my social club account, they could do anything they wanted with it. The account hijack happened at 12:33 PM and I got aware of it at around 6:30 PM. I immediately changed the password and reverted locale settings to english. At this point I thought I was safe, but I didn't remember one crucial thing: the password I used for social club was the same password I used for my email account. Then, the next morning, I received a notification from google saying that they prevented someone who knows my password from logging into my account. It was a russian IP, so I knew the attacks are connected. I then changed my email password and started to investigate. Good thing I posted about this here, because without you I don't think I would've known how to react properly, so thank you all for the helpful suggestions! I changed all of my passwords (they're all different now) and started using a password manager. I think I'm safe now, but one can never be cautious enough when it comes to internet security. And to make it clear, there weren't any phishing sites/fake links involved, they were all legit rockstar games links. The only unusual thing was the russian language. And one more thing, after I changed the social club password, at no point in time were the social club and email account passwords the same, so it was impossible for them to know my email password and to log into my mail client after that. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/pOsP8uh) are all of the emails I received from rockstar.\n\nI guess I'm lucky it had finished this way, it could've been much, much, worse. So once again, thank you everyone who helped!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE 5:\n\nGuess what, the [biggest data breach](https://www.troyhunt.com/the-773-million-record-collection-1-data-reach/) happened.",

And then tested your password against other sites. But I'd expect to read about this kind of breach.\n\nYou're phone call is weird though, seems like it's coming from a shipping/courier company in Athens ",
      "First of all, I'm sorry about this happening to you.  \nWe've seen a lot of database breaches recently, and more and more people suffer from their accounts being hacked.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no real thing to prevent these breaches, but there is a way to stop the people from getting access to all your other stuff.\n\nAre you the kind of guys who (like myself) used to use the same password everywhere?  \nIf so, you should stop this habit straight away, as it's the no. 1 reason for people hacking your accounts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat should you do now?\n\nFirst of all, change the email back to your own address.   \nBy doing this, you'll also find out if the hackers have (or have had) access to your email.  \nIf you only need to verify the switch on your own email, you can relax. If it's saying that you need to verify it from the matrix email, you should sign-out from all instances on your email, and create a new password.\n\nWhen that's done, you need to answer this question: Have you used this password before?  \nIf yes, then we have a bit of work in front of us.  \nIf no, then there's nothing to worry about.\n\nIf you've used it before, go here and check your passwords through: chrome://settings/passwords  \nAny site with the previous password, you should switch immediately!\n\nWhen you make a new password, either use the new feature in Chrome, where it creates a randomized password for you, or buy a Password Manager like LastPass, 1Password, or Dashlane.\n\nSpeaking of Password Managers, Dashlane has an awesome feature, where it will automatically change all of your previous passwords to new secure ones.  \nIt's a bit pricey though, so make up for yourself if you want to be paying for a Password Manager in the long run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding \"how\" it happened, you can go to this website and input your email: [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)  \nIt will show you if your email is listed within any breaches, and, if so, which ones.  \n\n\nLastly, the phone call.\n\nYou should not worry too much about this, as it's most likely unrelated, and just a big coincidence.\n\nYou should not be worried about this, as scammers phone several thousand numbers each and every day.  \n Whatever you do, though, **DON'T CALL THEM BACK.**  \n If you receive another call, you can pick it up without running too big of a risk, but never phone them from your own number.  \n\nIf you are not expecting a call from another country, I wouldn't go too deep into this though.  \nIf you ignore this call, and potentially the next one, they will figure  you're not answering, thus making them give up on scamming you.    \n",

Free Gift for my inconvenience. :)",
      "When you changed your password, did you use the link in the Russian email or go to Rockstar yourself? Phishing emails will attempt to appear real with a link that looks legitimate but isn't. Sometimes it is as simple as looking like a full link but that's just he hyperlink text and the real link under looks similar but slightly different and the webpage is made to look very similar as the real thing as well. So when you 'reset' your email and password, it doesn't really change it but rather just steals it.\n\nOld password = your now Rockstar Social Club email\n\nNew password = perhaps the password you use for gmail and other things.\n\nSo they log into your Rockstar account with the 'old password' and they'll also try to log into your gmail with both the old and new password from their phishing email/website and see if that gets them in. They also change your Rockstar account to a different email. They also may see your phone number. The call could still be from Russia or anywhere else. The way SIP, PBX, etc. works for telephone (and telephoney) technology is that phone numbers are so easy to spoof, that it really is arbitrary and can literally be any phone number they want including your own phone number.\n\nFor all of that, they really only needed your Rockstar username which they could have just guessed or if you reuse the same username, found it from another data breach that has your username. Usually, those data breaches will gain username and emails. So long as the password was hashed and properly salted, they probably would have no idea what the password was and needed to trick you into giving it to them.\n\nYou can check [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see if your email is involved in any known lists from data breaches.",

I won't know if it worked until the problem doesn't happen. If that doesn't work I'll just throw the PC out.",

      "Okay, I'll talk about the obvious:  Is your router and PC on the same electrical outlet?  If they are, I'd put the router on a different circuit. \n\nThe thinking here is the initial draw/spike of power to boot your machine could be giving your router a small drop in power forcing it to actually reboot when it gets power a second or so later.  Its also common for routers to take a few minutes to reboot so this stands in line with the 5 minute wait for internet to be restored.\n\nIf you find this to be the case, it could be remedied by potentially removing other items from that same circuit (are you using a space heater??) or just moving your router to a different circuit.  Just for testing, you could just run an extension cable for your router to another area of the house (hopefully on a separate circuit) and test then.  But also, if you are running a space heater (it is winter now...), or other devices in the room (printers, lamps, fans) just try turning those things off before booting and observe your network as it happens.\n\n\nEdit: At this point I'm just curious.  Would you be able to give us an update, /u/Filbilly ?",

      "If it only occurs at boot, then it's possible a process you have running on startup is hogging all of your bandwidth. A common culprit I've seen is OneDrive syncing files on startup. That's assuming you have Windows",
      "try pinging a IP address instead of a name. e.g. 4.4.4.4 for google DNS. I got the same issue with name services not working when I start some applications because they spam my router with requests and do a little homemade denial of service to myself. So check for programs that load a list of servers or something an try disabling their auto start  then go from there once you found the responsible application.",
      "If it's not a configuration issue, \n\ntry booting into the bios, and check if it still affects the network, if it does it probably is something to do with your NIC, if it's not something with your card and it still affecting your network before your OS start up  then my  wild guess would be that the phone line is passing pass near  the same wires your PC is drawing it's power...\n\nBack in the day of 56k dialup, our internet would go down when someone turned on the shower or the heated faucet (which is basically a micro electric shower) , the people who installed the cabling for the phone line  passed the wire near the same wires that went into the kitchen and bathroom and when we used these power hogging appliances the electrical interference was enough to make the call drop.... so it  might  be electric interference from your computer , which yes is incredibly rare , but can happen.\n\nYou can unplug the Ethernet cable from your pc  and then turn it on and see if it still affecting the network, if you're unplugged from your network and it still goes down, you'll have to call an eletrician",
      "Try a different ethernet cable. 2 of the cores may be joined and causing a short circuit. That's the only common denominator",
      "Just curious since everyone else is suggesting the computer or some configuration/hardware issue. Are your PC and Modem/Router on the same circuit? If they are when you turn it on do you notice any of the lights on the unit turn off? Just throwing it out there that power could be a factor as well especially if you are on an almost overloaded circuit."

I'm really scratching my head with this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile playing games I was getting weird restarts with a message saying \"Power surges detected during previous power on. ASUS Anti-Surge was triggered to protect system from unstable power supply unit\". This only happened when the PC was displaying in-game graphics or doing GPU benchmarks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI replaced the power supply but it was still happening. Then I plugged my old PSU back in and I heard sparks and smelled a sulpher like smell that seemed to be coming from the GPU. My PC wouldn't start but when I took out the GPU it started just fine. The name on the card wasn't even lighting up anymore so I RMA'd the card back to EVGA. Well this morning I got a replacement card and the same thing happened again. I got about 20 minutes of gaming and got a shut down. The PC is no longer starting up when the GPU is installed but starts up just fine without it. I tried the other PCI slot but the card seems to be completely dead. The lights don't turn on on the card anymore either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a surge protector but I should also note that a laptop blew and died about a month ago from a different socket and I've only been living here since December 1st. I started having my PC problems about a week or two after moving in. The people living here for 4 years before me say they never had any electronics blow. There are no obvious signs on damage on any of the components.\n\nSpecs:\n\nASUS Z170 Pro Gaming Motherboard\n\ni7 6700k CPU with NZXT Kracken X62 watercooler\n\nGTX 980ti (original and replacement)\n\nEVGA 850w GQ PSU\n\n16GB Corsair Vengeance RAM\n\n500GB M.2, 250GB SSD, 1TB HDD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny idea what to do next? Could it be the wiring of the house? Or could my MOBO be killing my GPUs?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: When looking for my fuse box I found [this](https://i.imgur.com/Le6fh6N.jpg) as I figured my trip switches should be going off if I'm getting power surges. Anyone have any idea what they are and if they would be able to handle the power draw of a modern PC?  I'm sending the PC in to a repair shop on Tuesday to assess the current damage.

So even if you do navigate to a dodgy website, whatever dodgy scripts it wants to run just won't work.\n\nAnd if I ever become suspicious that maybe my PC has been compromised, I just run a scan using the free version of Malwarebytes and to this day, I have never picked up a virus.\n\nBasically you just need a scan every now and then for peace of mind, a good ad blocker, a script blocker and the common sense to not click on a downloaded movie that has an exe or lnk extension.\n\nI'm sure that you'll find a basic AV that works on XP if you look around, won't be surprised if ClamAV works on XP.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great *idea*, but unless it has a lot (and I mean a *lot*) of exceptions set up, it won't really be useful, because it will remove stuff that isn't \"crap\".\n\nThis isn't something you can take a \"no thinking\" approach to. It searches for a series of words that might be useful.\n\nFor example: this will remove a trial version of anything. Anything advertising a \"free\" version (for example, I have [DVD videosoft](www.dvdvideosoft.com) which has a main program (that manages a series of subprograms) called \"free studio manager\". Any arcade games. As another poster said, it removed his \"need for speed game\" because it had the word speed in it. Any weather widget.

For example it might be helpful to provide a failsafe prompt rather than assuming all uninstallers will provide a prompt.  This is particularly important when you are providing a script that makes changes it can't reverse based on generic phrases you assume will catch only 'crapware'\n* Graciously accept constructive criticism.  Recommending features and pointing out potential issues are not attacks on your character or your work.  They are opportunities for improvement.\n* When providing a solution that makes potentially unwanted changes, at the very least you should add the ability to prompt for each change.  Ideally you would make this the default behavior and provide a parameter to silence these prompts.\n* IMHO being humble is valuable.  Some folks will write this off immediately with given the sensational title.  Perhaps my tongue-in-cheek-meter is off though.",

    "post": "***EDIT - 11-11-2014***\n\nI gave up on this project some time ago, but someone has done something much more detailed and even better than what I did.  Check out [Tron](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2lyn8k/tron_v401_20141107_processkiller_nircmd_e_flag/)\n\n\n***UPDATED 10-22-2011***\n\nEvery time we fix/maintain computers, we tend to do the same thing \u2013 Run chkdsk for errors, install the latest plugins, clean out the temp files, run anti-virus, run anti-malware, defragment the hard drive, and reboot the computer.  It\u2019s a tedious task because you have to keep going back to the computer over and over again to click \u201cnext\u201d to move on to the next install or next scan.  \n\nI geeked out a little last night and wrote a script that does (almost all of) this all automagically.  I\u2019ve tested it on Vista 32 bit with UAC enabled, XP 32 bit, and Windows 7 64 bit.  What this script currently does is as follows:  \n\n(**Bold = requires user interaction**)  \n\n1. Creates a log file at C:\\routinelog.txt and begins logging.  Purges existing log if there is one.\n2. Checks to see if your OS is 32 bit or 64 bit and continues accordingly.\n3. Strips out common crapware:  Bing Toolbar, Google Toolbar, Ask.com Toolbar, OnLine TV Toolbar, Yahoo! Toolbar, WeatherBug, McAfee Security Scan Plus, and Norton Security Scan.  \n4. *Requires Internet Access* Installs the latest Flash for all browsers, Silverlight, Air, Java, Shockwave, CCCP Codecs, Acrobat Reader, QuickTime, .NET framework, and MalwareBytes.\n5. Runs chkdsk.  If errors are found, it schedules a repair on next reboot.  If no errors are found, it moves on.\n6. Starts CCleaner to do an automatic cleaning of temp files, temp internet files, \u201cintelligent cookie scan\u201d, etc. *(see edit below)*\n7. Launches Defraggler to automatically defragment the C: *(see edit below)*\n8. Checks for Microsoft Security Essentials.  If it finds it, it automatically runs a definition update and a full scan.  If not, it moves on.\n9. Starts a malwarebytes full scan.  **When this completes, you need to manually select which files you want to clean.  If it asks to reboot, say NO.**\n10. Deletes the Reader, QuickTime, and Media player Classic desktop shortcuts that were created during the plugin install.\n11. Uninstalls Defraggler, CCleaner, and MalwareBytes so the newest versions are downloaded the next time this script runs.\n12. Reboots.  \n\n\nJust extract the folder and double click on routine.bat to start the process. **Edit:**  If you are not on an administrator account you should right click on the bat and say \"Run as Administrator\".  \n\nIf you want it to automatically install Microsoft Security Essentials so that it will scan in Step 8, replace ninite.exe with a version that includes downloading MSE.  \n\nSince this currently uses the free version of ninite and malwarebytes I cannot completely automate the process, hence the user interaction on step 9.  The free version license agreement of ninite and malwarebytes is for personal use only.  \n\nYou can download my utility here (Latest v 1.9):  [Clicky](http://www.mediafire.com/?87bbda95mmq7duv)  \n\nI'll probably clean it up or find another way later, but it seems to work pretty well...just don't run it on a computer that has a paid version of MalwareBytes on it!  \n\n**EDIT:**  I have updated to 1.9, which has the 1.8 fix (ccleaner and defraggler no longer on ninite, so they are included in the folder).  1.9 also includes deletion of common toolbars and crapware:  Bing Toolbar, Google Toolbar, Ask.com Toolbar, OnLine TV Toolbar, Yahoo! Toolbar, WeatherBug, McAfee Security Scan Plus, and Norton Security Scan.  I've only tested it with the most current downloadable versions.\n\n**Please note, Norton has no silent uninstaller so I have to forcefully delete files & registry keys.  This will decimate all norton software if both norton security scan AND a legit norton AV product are on the same machine -- Proceed with caution.  If you delete the \"%PROGRAMFILES%\\Norton Security Scan\" folder from the machine before running this script - Or manually uninstall Norton Security Scan, the Norton cleanup portion of my script will not run.**",

    "bestcomment": [
      "No. UPS devices generally also provide surge protection. Daisy-chaining surge protectors can result in some pretty wonky malfunctions and presents a fire hazard.",
      "APC's website provides some reasons why you shouldn't.\nhttps://www.schneider-electric.us/en/faqs/FA158852/",
      "No. UPS should go to a wall outlet. Don't plug the UPS into a surge protector, don't plug a surge protector into a UPS.",
      "apparently there can be a fire hazard with 2 power-filtering devices connected in series.\n\nfrom memory:\n\nthe chips inside each device \"monitor\" the power flow and expect to be connected to the \"main\" unfiltered grid.\n\nthey look out for fluctuations based on how the grid looks/feels to them.\n\nbut if say, a UPS is connected to a filter, all the UPS sees is \"filtered\" power and cannot react properly to any weirdness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsorry i cant recall properly the tech reasons why.\n\nsuffice to know for myself, that i NO LONGER connect a UPS to a surge protector, or indeed, ANY surge devices/UPS in parallel.",
      "NO right in the wall unless it cost like 29.95 at walmart or costco if its a decent one it already has surge and line filtration.",
      "One valid reason it's not recommended is because better power strips and backup supplies include an AC line filter consisting of capacitors and coils, and when 2 protective devices each have one, the filters can interact weirdly and make some surges worse, rather than block them.  On the other hand, there's no problem if one of the devices has no line filter but only a set of MOV crowbars across the AC wires, as any power strip surge protector certified UL 1449 does (except some expensive ones designed differently).  Line filters block high frequencies that almost always accompany surges and work even below the voltage that triggers the crowbars.  They can prevent your computer from locking up or rebooting when a big motor (vacuum cleaner, refrigerator) or laser printer plugged into the same AC circuit turns on or off.  \n\nAnother valid reason against plugging a backup supply into anything but a household AC outlet is because of lower impedance (resistance) for the connections, especially for ground, to where most surges get diverted.  ",
      "Ok. first off, terminology. A UPS is a battery backed up power distribution unit utilizing an internal power inverter. A surge protector is a power strip with a breaker in it. A power filter actually 'filters' odd transients on the input power. A power strip is just a multi plug strip without breaker protection. ANYONE MIXING THESE TERMS SHOULD NOT BE LISTENED TO!!! ANYONE WHO THINKS DAISY CHAINING POWER STRIPS CAN ONLY MEAN FIRE SHOULD NOT BE LISTENED TO!!! The key is to not exceed current draw on the first link. \n\nYES! you CAN attach a UPS to a surge protector, all you're doing is adding an extra breaker between the mains and the UPS. NO you DO NOT NEED TO. A UPS protects BOTH sides of a voltage window, under AND over. YES you CAN attach a surge protector to a UPS, all its does is put a breaker between the UPS and the load. If you want to arrest a surge BEFORE your UPS, put it on a surge protector, its fine. If you want to arrest a surge AFTER your UPS, add a surge protector after, its fine.\n\nPower filters/conditioners is a fuzzy area, and id advise against it without researching that specific conditioner and UPS.\n\nAlso, EARTH GROUND EVERYTHING!!! NEVER use a 'cheater plug' on 3 prong units and ensure the earth is actually earthed.\n\nTLDR - **CAN** you? Yes. **SHOULD** you? If you trust the UPS circuitry, dont bother.",
      "# NO",
      "I've done a lot of reading on this and despite what APC and all these comments agree on, I've found it to be harmless. It is actually somewhat recommended when using a quality surge protector like a Tripp Lite. I've been doing it for years with my CyberPower CPF1500 and a couple APC devices. It seems to be pretty accepted that you should never do it the other way around and plug a power strip or surge protector into a UPS. \n\n> Protecting the electronic UPS: Surge protection is recommended at the input to all electronic loads and the UPS is no exception. The AC-to-DC converter, the static bypass switch, and to a lesser extent the DC-to-AC inverter, are all susceptible to transient damage. Sensitive and transient susceptible electronic control circuitry constantly monitors the status of the UPS and the input and output AC power of the UPS. This circuitry is used to determine if the UPS should be delivering power from the batteries and DC-AC converter: or, if the UPS should switch to the bypass mode and deliver AC from the secondary source which is usually the utility AC power. Additionally, when the UPS is in the bypass mode for maintenance or due to failure, the sensitive loads should also be protected against transient disruption, degradation, and damage from the transients appearing on the secondary AC source or utility power.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://alltecglobal.com/products/surge-suppression/\n\nhttps://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/plugging-a-ups-into-a-surge-protector.2323385/post-19354842\n\nhttps://www.hometheaterforum.com/community/threads/ups-plugged-into-a-surge-protector-bad.212438/\n\nhttps://switchon.eaton.com/plug/article/176/ups-vs.-surge-suppressor#modal",
      "Agreed with everyone else here. No surge protectors with a UPS. The UPS already has built in surge protection so there really is no need for it. Mine has multiple outlets, some are battery backup and surge protected. Others are only surge, so there really is no need to have one plugged into the other.\n\nEDIT: mistype"

When playing one of the games that makes my pc shutdown sometimes (dark souls 3) the Temps registered by the CPU weren't at all alarming (54\u00b0C/130\u00b0F) but my GPU Temps were (85\u00b0C/185\u00b0F), so I thought that was the issue. But when I got to play the game that instantly shutdowns my computer every time I play it (PUBG) the Temps of the GPU were around 74\u00b0C/165\u00b0F before shutting down. What I noticed was the GPU load was at 100% most of the time and was at 100% when it shutdown. My GPU is an AMD Radeon 290 tri-x, and my CPU an AMD FX-8370 black edition. I was hoping someone could tell me something I'm missing.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses! I read every one of them and most of you agree on a psu issue.

    "post": "Hello dear Redditors,\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni have been having problems with my computer for past year, but i never really payed any attention to them, until now.\n\nI had issues where mouse would randomly jump during usage, attributing this only to generic mouse jumpiness, more often, computer acting as if CTR or ALT or windows key was being pressed, this appearing completely randomly and apparently unrelated to any running software - i have read somewhere that windows 10 had some kind of this issue, and i could easily fix it with pressing both ctrl/alt/windows keys at the same time few times to relieve this, so i wasnt particularly concerned, even though i did a repair of windows once, which didnt help for long.\n\nHowever, what happend today, scared me somewhat, as i have never ever crossed path with anything similar.\n\nI have been watching youtube and chatting with a friend over steam, when i put my headphones on instead of speakers after months, and noticed strange sounds. I could clearly hear someone, as if over voice chat, not talking, just sitting at computer. I could hear keypresses, clicks and what sounded like someone drinking water and putting down the glass on wooden table.\n\nI first checked if my mic was disabled, then looked through playback devices, nothing looking like producing sound.\n\nAt first i have writtent to friend over steam, to say something, thinking its some new steam chat feature or something, but i couldnt hear him say anything when he tried.\n\nThen i clearly heard someone receive a message on phone - three beeps of some kind, a pause, then a crackling click, like when you pull the speakers out of jack connector, and since then nothing.\n\nI have no other voice chat apps installed, like skype/discord/etc. I have my microphone always disabled unless i want to use it for something, but it was turned off for past few months. I have no other recording devices. The only thing i had turned on during this day was firefox, monster hunter world, and steam, but when the issue occured, only steam and firefox with youtube was running.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo i panicked, blocked all internet access through firewall, restarted to safe boot, run:\n\nrkill\n\nadwcleaner\n\nhitmanpro\n\nmalwarebytes scan\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnothing turned out except two tracking cookies in firefox, which i removed.\n\nIm basically clueless as google searches dont turn out anything useful for this issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny idea what can this be? Any advice on what i should try?\n\nIm running windows 10\n\nI may provide additional information if neccessary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance to anyone who can help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nThanks everyone for answering, however, i am 99,9% sure this was not some kind of radio statio. I could literally hear someone sitting at his computer. The three beeps i heard, of message arriving, this wasnt the typical crack of the speaker coil receiving the signal - this was literall beep of message received sound on mobile phone. Unless i can receive someones bluetooth headphone microphone, which im positive i cant, this wasnt just a random transmission.\n\nThis would not worry me so much, if there wasnt also issue of the pressed alt/ctr/windows logo keys randomly acting as if pressed. Because combined with this, i feel like someone could have remotely accessed my desktop and now he just randomly forgotten turning his mic off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nThanks for all the answers and advice. So far i wasnt able to replicate this, and after looking through my network the whole day i havent noticed any strange traffic, or noticed any more strange sounds, but i went ahead with full format and reinstall anyway, just to be sure. \n\nNo antivirus/rootkit scanners turned out anything, so i will be hoping for the most mentioned probable cause - headphones picking up some transmission,  although, considering the clarity of the sound i heard, i still doubt this somewhat. \n\nAs i cant think of anything else to try, and it seems all the good jokes have been said for now, ill be marking this post as solved. \n\nThanks everyone for help",

A symptom is that if you or they receive an SMS, you might hear a slight sort of static and pulse as the carrier wave is picked up by your copper wire.\n\nSometimes this is just that the copper cable isn't insulated enough but it could also be a crappy ground on your chassis. A symptom to check this is to see if you press your hand on a metal part of your case and see if that changes the audio you hear at all and if it does then that's part of the problem but still if you use USB or some other digital solution, this won't be a problem.\n\nUsually, this is pretty common for cheap wire that barely has any insulation and no shielding.\n\nOn the other hand, the other person may be experiencing the same thing with you believe it or not.",

The types of sounds you heard don't sound likely to be coming from radio frequencies like mentioned in here. I would have closed my browser to see if that helped.

      "I just want to chime in here really quickly. What are your general daily stuff? If you just browse the internet and watch netflix you don't need a very \"high-end\" laptop. Netflix specifically is more dependent on your internet speed than anything.\n\nIF you are using this mostly for Netflix I would look at screen quality over any other specs. Like someone else suggested. Go to Best Buy or Fry's and try out a few laptops. See what looks good to you, and make sure the viewing angles and everything suit your needs.\n\nI assume that since you are looking for an Asus specifically this means you have one particular in mind? Also, are you planning to buy from Wal-Mart? Like it was mentioned earlier. I highly recommend buying through Amazon. Not only will you get a much better price, but Amazon has outstanding support that will always help you if something goes wrong with the product (they aren't tech support though).\n\nBasically. Netflix is not demanding on a computer, and you will get much more enjoyment out of a higher quality screen than a higher spec'd computer.\n\nedit: sorry if this is a bit overwhelming, but here is a link to an Amazon page with all highly rated laptops under $800 with a screen that is 17\" or larger.

The energy saving mode, that limits that port, isn't always on, so that you can get gigabit ethernet on that port for some time. Took me a while to figure that out and switch that mode off for full speed.\n\nOtherwise, since gigabit is working for some time, your router, PC and switch seem to support gigabit connections. So maybe, as someone else said, it's your cable. Check, if it's at least Cat.5e (Cat.6 should be fine, too). If that's the case, check if the cable is bent or if there's some damage on the cable.

      "I am going to suggest researching the QOS settings of your router and prioritizing VPN traffic.  \n\n\nIt's not likely both devices have the same mac or ip. The laptop is wireless; chances are it is doing DHCP, and unless you have setup a static on your PS4 it will also DHCP.",
      "3 things I can think of:\n\n1) Overall usage is maxing out your bandwidth. What's your internet plan's bandwidth?\n\n2) Duplicate IP addresses. If you both have the same IP address, that will conflict, and generally a wired connection will take precedence over wireless. Do you have DHCP (automatic IP configuration) enabled on your PS4 or do you use a static IP?\n\n3) Bad Ethernet Port causing a \"Broadcast Storm.\" Are other device's connectivity affected when your PS4 is plugged in? I know you say they're fine, but are you testing them for a few minutes or longer? Broadcast storms generally cause intermittent issues that may not be immediately apparent.",
      "It wouldn't be the MAC Address as each device is uniquely hardcoded at factory build. However I would check IP's and probably would set a reservation for a specific IP for only your PS4 so that it is the only one that would be assigned that IP. It could also potentially be fighting over the port access as I'm sure (but not certain) that the PS4 creates a VPN connection to their servers as well. Might want to look at setting up port forwarding for the PS4 as well.",
      "Creating a DHCP reservation on your home router is a good option if it is indeed an IP lease issue. Also, make sure you're not double NAT'd. That can cause all kinds of crazy shit. If you have a home router and a modem that also acts as a router, turn one of them into bridge mode. Probably not the issue but never hurts to ask.",
      "Besides checking for duplicate IP, how close are these together or are they next to the router? I'm guessing her laptop is connected wirelessly. If it is an older laptop using 2G, it's signal can be interfered with by nearby appliances.\n\nAlso check your router settings to see which channel it is using. If it is crowded from other people's networks, they can cause more interference as well. Consider switching to 1, 6 or 11. They don't have overlap.",
      "Longshot here, but older routers and laptops use the 2.4 GHZ spectrum for WiFi. Bluetooth also uses the 2.4GHZ spectrum as well, and the PS4 controllers connect using Bluetooth.\n\n\nCould be that this is causing inteference and slowing down your wife's wireless connection to a crawl.\n\n\nYou can try connecting your PS4 over WiFi and see if the issue persists to rule out an IP addressing conflict easily which is another suggestion.",
      "/u/KingCrapalotakiss is on the right track here. I'd agree and if it were I would:\n\n* Test both devices on Wired (doing this will rule out whether it's a WIFi problem or not. If her Laptop works fine on Wired but not on WiFi.. then you've isolated the problem down to something related to WiFi. If her Laptop IS effected both on WiFi or Wired.. then it's more of a bandwidth/traffic or Protocol/Port problem. \n\n* I'd Google search for the Make/Model of Router you have,.. look for any Firmware updates,. and QOS settings to prioritize her VPN (although by doing so. you're obviously DE-prioritizing your gaming traffic). And you may end up seeing the opposite problem (any time she's on VPN, your gaming will thrash). \n\nYou may also want to (specifically) Google search on the exact Type/Software of VPN she's using.. and/or the combination of that and the Make/Model of Router you have.. and see if you can follow any answers/forum/discussions there to see if other people have similar scenarios.",
      "Is the PS4 trying to create its own WiFi network (to connect PS Vita systems)? Double check that.",
      "Sounds daft but plug your controller in aswell to rule out wireless interference from it. Also check to see if you can swap out your wife's network card for a compatible card that supports 5GHz. You might need to check with IT or check the card is authorised on the laptop white list.\n\nMight be worth remembering that if you suffer from poor wifi strength then any introduction of noise is going to throw it off.",
      "As stated by a few others, this is likely an IP conflict.  \nThe strange part is the VPN, was it confirmed that while the laptop is on your home network there are no issues, and confirmed that the issues start when the VPN is connected?  \n\nFirst step I would try is to manually assign your PS4 a static IP - this would probably be easier than your spouse laptop as hopefully their group policy prevents users from accessing the adapter properties.\n\nIf that does not resolve it I would then try to assign a IP to the laptop from the router/modem page."

I created a new google drive account, and uploaded the .gdoc files, but I still cannot open them.  It would seem that they're only able to be opened on the very google drive account that was suspended.\n\nThe night I received the email notifying me of my suspension, I called Google Support.  They advised me that I should appeal the decision and directed me on how to do this.  I submitted the appeal.  It has been a week and I have heard nothing.  I called Google Support again today and was told that they have no means of directly communicating with the team that makes decisions about revoking account access, but they can send them a message about my situation.  I asked them to explain my situation about the .gdoc files and to request that they would at least send me these files in the form of word docs.  They also advised me to submit another appeal, which I did.  It reads as follows:\n\n\"My google drive account has been suspended and the Google Support team advised me to appeal again. I have so much trust in your product that for the last couple of years I took notes exclusively through Google Docs, saved to the Google Drive account you have suspended. Because these were largely saved in \".gdoc\" format, the \nbackup I had of these documents are all useless- they can only be opened in google drive, and only in the specific google drive account that you blocked me from. I absolutely require a means of getting a MS Word copy of all of my.gdoc files, otherwise I will have lost \nyears of research and hard work that I've done. Of course I'd like to have full access to my account again and I would do anything to get that back. Please call or write me so we can discuss this further, I would like not to have to keep badgering Google with my requests. \nIt's ironic that to show me how much I need to respect intellectual property rights, Google has taken away my intellectual property.\"\n\nDoes anyone know what I can do to get a response from someone who can actually help me at Google?

      "The gdoc extension files are nothing more than links to the file within Google Docs. So you are correct that a .gdoc file isn't something you can open in another Google Drive account.\n\nIn the future, you should backup to docx.\n\nAs far as what to do - I think you're on the right track. Just be humble and ask for a docx copy of your previously saved documents. I'm guessing they thought you had some copyrighted material saved into your Google Drive. It was probably found by some automated scan.\n\nYou might also open up a new Google account and ask them if they could transfer the documents unrelated to whatever caused them to close your account into the new account.

When it was available I was a huge fan of TrueCrypt, kept a small encrypted file-volume locker and that let me keep whatever I wanted on the service without the service knowing what was being stored. Once I switched to Macintosh I came across encrypted sparse-bundle volumes. That was a great find, get a 2GB dropbox, put a 2GB sparse-bundle volume on it, and as the bands get updated the sync app makes all the connected machines the same, so attaching the encrypted sparse-bundle on another machine is a snap. This kind of arrangement is quite great and relatively easy to use. The service doesn't have to trust you and you don't need to trust the service. It's win/win. :)",

    "postTitle": "Switching from iphone 7 to galaxy s10",
    "bestcomment": [
      "They both use a Nano style SIM slot, so technically, you *should* be able to simply move it to the S10.",
      "Normally you just need to put your SIM into your new phone, I'm in Europe so maybe it's not the same ",
      "Moving the SIM should work fine. \n\nDon't forget to disable iMessage before you switch, so you won't miss texts from your iPhone using friends.  \n\nAlso if you want some Android app recommendations let me know. ",
      "Use your old SIM or call and provide them with the new SIM # included with the phone. ",
      "Yes you can just put the sim from the iphone into the Samsung. As long as a phone is unlocked, it can take any sim card from any carrier. Most Samsung's will also have an option when you first set them up to transfer data from an iphone which can make the process a lot easier too.",
      "Good choice!  When you get your S10, I have some recommendations for you to make your switch as great as possible:\n\n1. Increase the display resolution and enable dark mode.  Dark mode saves battery life (and looks better) and increasing your display resolution from the default would make it look better.\n2. Set up Adapt Sound and Dolby Atmos (along with the equalizer).  I can guarantee you that it will make your music and videos sound much better and clearer.\n3. Replace some of the Samsung apps.  While most of the Samsung apps are good, some aren't that great.  For me, I replaced Gallery with Google Photos, Messages with Android Messages, and changed the launcher to Nova Launcher.  These apps do their job better than the Samsung apps because of some key features.  Let me know if you want to know what these are.  (You can also Google it)\n4. Install [System UI Tuner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zacharee1.systemuituner&hl=en_US).  This app useful and will allow to customize many aspects of your Android device.  However, you will need to use ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to make this app work.  While you will need to grab a computer and use ADB through the command line, you will not have any issues whatsoever.  It's worth it in my opinion.\n5. Enable swipe gestures instead of on-screen buttons.  You can get rid of the fat ugly navigation bar and replace it with a swipe gesture bar that will be less obtrusive.  It's similar to the iPhone swipe gestures.  To do this, go to Settings > Navigation Bar > Full Screen Gestures.  You will still have the same actions (recents, home, back), but instead, you will swipe up to use them.  If you're like me and don't like the bar on the bottom, enable the Gesture hints option in the Navigation Bar settings menu.  This will make the navbar invisible, but still have the exact same functionality.\n6. Install \"Good Lock\" from the Galaxy Apps store.  Good Lock is a new app made by Samsung themselves that allows you to customize your Galaxy even more.  You can make your own AOD theme, navbar, clock setup, and much more.  There are a ton of options that can make your Galaxy look awesome and unique.\n7. (Optional) Disable/Remap the Bixby button.  I honestly don't mind Bixby, but I never use it.  If you simply hate Bixby and don't want to see it at all, you can download [Package Disabler Pro+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elmklmsamsung.batteryaddon) from the Play Store.  You will need to activate it using ADB, but once it's all set, you can find the Bixby packages and disable them from there.  If you don't want to disable Bixby entirely, you can either disable the button or remap the button to an app in the Bixby settings.  To do this, press the Bixby button > the three dots menu > Settings > Bixby Key.  The rest is self explanatory.\n\nI hope you check out those when you get your S10!  All of those make a significant difference for me during regular use.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Almost forgot about  [https://www.reddit.com/r/S10wallpapers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/S10wallpapers/) .

It should support NTFS (it's a HGST drive) but the scammers have obviously mucked with the firmware somehow since it didn't accept NTFS when formatting with Windows, mucking around with Bootice yielded this inability to write/read. It's a HGST HTS 545032A7E680, some incomplete info from the label (ripped off with the underside of the fake label) - [https://imgur.com/2zbg4Pz](https://imgur.com/2zbg4Pz)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe drive is detected but I only get seek errors on any action. Any idea how to fix this at a lower-level?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I managed to get it working somehow using HDDLowlevelformat (letting it run and ignoring all the errors), then using Hirens boot cd (AOMEI partition assistant), maybe it's best left alone in terms of restoring its native capacity, beyond my skills.",
    "postTitle": "How to restore a corrupted counterfeit hard drive that is refusing I/O activity?",
    "bestcomment": [
      "Just a question (and no offense intended): Why are you spending so much time and effort just to try and get a counterfeit drive which is most likely defective in the first place working? Honestly I'd cut the hassle and just buy a new drive. The scammers often use rejects from the factory that work \\*good enough\\* so that you won't be suspicious until long enough from when you bought it that you can't ask for a refund or return to the seller.\n\nThis seems too much work for very little gain IMO. 320GB is not a lot and brand new drives can be bought cheaply enough on Amazon.\n\nIMO it's not really worth it, but if you really want to try making it act normal, then you'd have to get software to flash directly to the hard disk's firmware (if even possible on your drive) and a firmware image to flash from. If you can't flash from the PC, then you'd most likely need an SPI/serial interface to re-flash the firmware on the on-board memory. This would most likely require either extensive knowledge of chip flashing and hardware-level communications/coding and the like and/or expensive flashing equipment too.\n\nThese scamming operations are actually pretty complicated. They have to know a hell of a lot about what they're doing to pull off something like this at a cost. It's a lucrative and well-profitable business.\n\nAnother thing you can do is simply create a partition comfortably smaller than what the hard disk's capacity is actually rated at, so instead of having a 1TB partition, make a 200GB partition and try that.\n\nAlso I didn't know they still made Travelstar drives! That's a throwback to some IBM machines I've worked on back in the day and recently.\n\nTL;DR I wouldn't advise using it for anything remotely important if you decide to.\n\nEdit: The takeaway from this is that nearly everything on Aliexpress is a scam of some sort. Though you pay less, you really do get what you pay for. Shop at a reputable company where you can when it comes to things like this; paying that bit extra makes the world of difference.",
      "You can get a high quality 2TB drive for like $50, what price do you put on your time? If I were you I would seek a refund and forget about the shitty hard drive, even if you manage to get it working it's probably defective.",

      "It doesn't have a native capacity because the firmware has been mucked up to trick you into giving away your money.  You are guessing that is the original label under the fake one.  You can't trust the drive and you have no idea what else is in the buffer or firmware.   It is a nice paperweight that will sit on your desk reminding you every day to be more careful about your purchases.\n\nWhile there is a way to flash the firmware on a hard drive, this just isn't worth the time or effort.\n\nBased on the info you provided and the data on the label, I found the data sheet but the part numbers don't match up.

I checked the driver in device manager said it was the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.  I tried to install the drivers, but said no suitable card was found.  I checked to make sure I had the right driver, etc.  Then had the bright idea to have device manager show me all devices, and there it was disabled and hidden.  So at one point it had been installed (I'm not crazy), and now it says it's not connected. (Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45))\n\nIt's an Auros x5v7.  Unfortunately their tech manuals are non-existent, so I'm not really keen on doing much more than opening the back for basic HDD or easily accessible stuff work.\n\nI'm wondering if the video card is bad or missing, is it expected that a basic onboard GPU on the motherboard might take over?  Or is it possible the card on the laptop was disconnected during repair and not properly reconnected?   Really hate to send this back for repair again, as it's been two months (yes, two months) already.\n\nFYI, went in for repair in the winter for a broken screen.  This time for warranty because the solder joints on the power-in broke ad the laptop couldn't charge.",

I'll start off by saying, send it back they screwed up.\n\nHowever, it's probably a simple mess up, on install they didn't finish the setup of drivers.  Go online, find the appropriate (Laptop/Mobile) version of the GeForce 1070 drivers from NVidia, and try to install them.  That's a simple fix, non intrusive, and rules out any harder processes, like going back to Warranty repair or opening it up.\n\nSince it is, or just came back from, under warranty, don't bother opening it physically.  I say leave all the hard work (And subsequently, possibly screw ups that can cause damage) to the pros who will pay for it if they damage it.\n\nLooking at the picture, I think Windows \"Sees\" the card, but doesn't have full drivers installed/activated.  The other possibility here, is Windows Update wrote over the drivers (My laptop did that too, and I've troubleshot MANY laptops/desktops that have this issue, both Nvidia and AMD GPUs) and you need to manually install them, and disable windows update from overwriting them again.",

    "post": "This guide is geared towards the average computer user who is interested in learning how to remove viruses trojans and other forms of malware. It's written in (what I hope) is an easy to follow step-by-step guide.\n\nI spent two years disinfecting people's malware-ridden laptops and desktops at a large public university. This is the disinfection method I use and recommend for anyone who is infected or interested in learning how to remove viruses. \n\nFeel free to share this post with your family and friends; you can print out the guide and burn a copy of the files listed below onto a CD/DVD (USB sticks may be vectors for infection) and send it their way. I've also created a redirect URL:\nhttp://compromised.notlong.com\n\nEnjoy!\nJon\n\n\nBefore starting, if your data is valuable, **back it up**. It is ok if you backed up the malware, if worse comes to worst your operating system breaks and the computer needs to be reformatted you'll just need to install Microsoft Security Essentials or another solid antivirus BEFORE plugging your backup media back into the computer and the AV should filter any viruses. I recommend [disabling autoplay in Windows](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715) to prevent any infections and to also scanning the drive with [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware](http://ninite.com/malwarebytes/) before transferring.\n\n\n**Symptoms of an infection**\n\nSymptoms of malware infection range from being nearly undetectable (keyloggers) to blatantly obvious (An application that calls itself \"Vista Anti-Spyware 2012\" should sound a little suspicious).\n\n* Security applications such as the users antivirus and firewall are disabled or fail to update.\n* New programs the user doesn\u2019t remember installing appear.\n* A generic antivirus program claiming the system is infected and asking for money.\n* A failure to boot in the form of either a black screen with a message about a corrupt file or the blue screen of death (BSOD) usually 0X000007B, sometimes 8a.\n* The computer is slow, processor and memory usage are near full even with no applications are running.\n* The user tries to browse or make a search query and is rerouted to a suspicious site.\n* There are some fake antivirus variants I have seen that claim your hard drive is failing. Don't trust anything that you haven't researched. I recommend running [a real test of your hard drive](http://www.hitachigst.com/support/downloads/#DFT) if you suspect there are also hard drive issues (symptoms include slow responses, freezing, crashing, loss of internet connectivity, etc) - If this test fails you simply need to backup your data, replace the hard drive and reinstall the operating system from your recovery discs (or replacements from your manufacturer), then restore your data.\n\n\n**Tools**\n\nPlease download these programs and stick them on your desktop or an easily accessible folder \n\n* [rKill](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/grinler/rkill.com)\n\n* [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/portable/downloadfile)\n* [Combofix](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/protected/d11a155c8fca84d005f106d9810f6464/4d19f694/ComboFix.exe)\n\n* [Malwarebytes via Download.com](http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&subj=dl&tag=button)\n\n* [Microsoft Security Essentials - if you only have a trial anti-virus software or you want a good replacement](http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials)\n\n* [My Network Settings Reset Tool](http://www.technibble.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=1220&d=1293371885)\n\n\n\n**Step 1: Safe Mode**\n\nBoot into Safe Mode with Networking by pressing F8 repeatedly during bootup. This should bring up a menu that looks like [this](http://www.pcfeeder.com/images/stories/W7_BootIntoSafeMode/SafeMode_7.png). Select \"Safe mode with Networking\"\n\n\n\n**Step 2: Run [rKill](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/grinler/rkill.com)**\n\nThis should kill any malware processes that are still active, it'll generate a text file log which will list what it kills. It may kill any HP printer startups and some harmless items, those are fine, however if you see things like dwm.exe it's likely malware (note dwm.exe is a legitimate Windows Vista/7 file used to provide Aero transparency effects, but the malware calls itself the same so the OS points to the infected file instead of the real one).\n\n\n\n**Step 3: Run [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/portable/downloadfile)**\n\nThis will remove temp files where some some of the malware reside.\n\n\n\n\n**Step 4: Run [Combofix](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/protected/d11a155c8fca84d005f106d9810f6464/4d19f694/ComboFix.exe)**\n\nFollow [This guide](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/combofix/how-to-use-combofix) on how to use Combofix. NOTE THAT COMBOFIX WILL TSA YOUR COMPUTER AND MAY IN RARE CASES BREAK YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM-PROCEED WITH CAUTION-OTHERWISE OPT-OUT AND GO TO STEP 6.\nCombofix now also supports 64-bit operating systems! =)\n\n\n\n\n**Step 5: Reboot and boot into Safe Mode [F8 key at startup] Again**\n\nYou will need to reboot after Combofix completes otherwise .exe files won't run.\n\n\n\n\n**Step 6: Install and run [Malwarebytes via Download.com](http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&subj=dl&tag=button)**\n\nThis is pretty straightforward, simply install it, update it, and run a full scan of the OS. This may take up to a few hours depending on your system.\n\n\n\n**Step 7: Check your Antivirus and do a Full scan**\n\nIf you have an expired antivirus that came with your computer or you don't trust the one you have, I recommend downloading and installing Microsoft Security Essentials, it's free and has pretty good detection rates, however AV-test.org in Q1 gave it a pretty low detection rating. MSE 2.0 won't catch everything, but keep in mind no antivirus is, and none of them can make up for safe surfing habits and updates to plugins and the operating system. If you want more protection, you could support the developers and buy a full copy of Malwarebytes which includes the real-time protection components. If MSE isn't your cup of tea (it will take a lot of RAM and slow down the older gen netbooks that have >=1GB of RAM) you can try any of the other AV's offered out there. For the free ones I recommend Avira followed by AVG. In terns of paid protection, Kaspersky is a well recognized and well respected AV, personally if I had the money to spend I'd use it (note that its very paranoid but it will keep your computer pretty safe).\n\n\n\n**Optional: Run another Second Opinion Scanner**\n\n* [Hitman Pro](http://www.surfright.nl/en/downloads/)\n\n* [SuperAnti-Spyware](http://www.superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE)\n\n* Some people suggest Ad-Aware and Spybot. We can party like it's 2004 or use programs that actually remove malware. I view those as old-gen tech that had their glory days and no longer have what it takes to protect the computer. If you or whoever you are helping feels they provide an extra sense of security there's no harm in installing them (note however that on older machines they may just take up more RAM and slow the system down).\n\n\n\n**Step 8: Network Settings Reset**\n\nThe Network Settings Reset tool will remove any hardcoded IPs, DNS redirects, proxies that the virus may use. \n\n\n**Step 9: Change your passwords!**\n\nThere are some nasty trojans out there like zBot which will steal your passwords, credit card numbers, etc and send them off to people in other countries, these people are interested in the redistribution of your wealth (or lack thereof). If you paid the fake antivirus with your credit card, cancel the card. As a precaution I would recommend changing your login passwords, make sure they have characters with at least one lowercase, uppercase, symbol, and number, for a good guide check out this [XKCD comic](http://xkcd.com/936/).\nDon't use the same login username and passwords for every site If they found your gmail username and password perhaps you use it for your PayPal or Amazon account as well.\n\n\nIf you are sure you have been a victim of ID theft please visit [The FTC's site on ID theft](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/) for assistance.\n\n\n\n**Step 10: Secure your Computer**\n\nMake sure you run Windows Update and the latest service packs are installed and your firewall is enabled, the Antivirus is updating and not expired, Make sure Firefox/Java/Adobe/Flash are updated, if not, run the individual installers or batch install them using [Ninite](http://ninite.com).\n\nTo see which version of the programs you have simply go to Start (orb) | Run | type \"appwiz.cpl\" which will take you to the Add/Remove panel (Program and Features in WinV/7)\n\n**Programs and Plugins with Security vulnerabilities**\n\n* Java: Version 6 Update 32 (as of 6/\n* Adobe Reader: Version 10.x\n* Adobe Flash: 10.x\n\nAnything short of Java version 7 (eg version 6 update 26 is probably going to get you reinfected, as each new version patches multiple vulnerabilities discovered in the previous version).\n\nFor a complete list of what needs updating run the [Plugin Check](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/plugincheck/) for all browsers.\n\n**Windows Service Packs**\n\nHere's a [link](http://windows.about.com/od/windowsosversions/ss/Determine_Vista_Version_Service_Pack.htm) to determine which version service pack you may have.\n\n* XP: Service Pack 3\n* Vista: Service Pack 2\n* 7: Service Pack 1 (this is optional, so you have to check Windows Update yourself to install)\n\nIf you are still infected you may have a Master Boot Record (MBR) Virus (however ComboFix should have removed it) More information on how to remove an MBR virus can be found on my forum post [here](http://www.technibble.com/forums/showthread.php?p=173778#post173778).\n\n\n**Advanced Tools**\n\n* [Autoruns](http://live.sysinternals.com/autoruns.exe)\n* [Process Explorer](http://live.sysinternals.com/procexp.exe)\n* [GMER](http://www.gmer.net/)\n* [TDSSKILLER](http://support.kaspersky.com/downloads/utils/tdsskiller.exe)\n* [Hijack This!](http://download.cnet.com/Trend-Micro-HijackThis/3000-8022_4-10227353.html)\n* [OTL](http://www.geekstogo.com/2010/05/27/otl-by-oldtimer-a-modern-replacement-for-hijackthis/)\n\n\n**For the paranoid**\n\nI'm going to guess by now at least someone has a bone to pick since I didn't mention getting a third party firewall. I don't feel the need to have a 3rd party firewall because the one built into Vista/7 already covers both outbound and inbound but there are tons out there people have felt have kept them safe. My take is to each his own, just make sure the infection hasn't broken its rules or its overall functionality.\n\nThere is also something that blacklists known bad IP servers called PeerBlock, which a lot of people use to prevent third-party copyright agencies from catching people who torrent.

    "post": "So, I recently bought a new custom pc with a motherboard which has inbuilt wifi. However, while the rest of the computer is working, the WiFi isn't, even after connecting the antenna.\n\nAfter looking into the network adapters within device manager, I could only find the 'Intel Gigabit Network Connection', which I am led to believe is only for ethernet (I couldn't find much about this tbh). \n\nI also went into control panel and then network connections, and again I could only find an adapter called 'Ethernet', which was also the Intel Gigabit Network Connection\n\nThanks in advance for any help you can offer. \n\nEdit: Here is a snip of the device manager, for those who asked\n[Device Manager Screenshot](https://imgur.com/IXjkcuk)\n\nEdit 2: Yes I have downloaded the drivers from the motherboards webpage, still nothing happening unfortunately :(\n\nEdit 3: Next step is to wait for warranty support and maybe get it replaced. In the meantime I'll try to get/find an Ethernet cable to update Windows. Honestly speaking, I would be completely fine with just ethernet, but I feel like after having paid for the wireless option, that I should at least get it. \n\nAlso thanks so much for all of your help so far!\n\nMotherboard: B450 Aorus Pro Wifi\nOS: Windows, ver 1903",

      "That motherboard uses a small M.2 WiFi card that is installed underneath the I/O cover, [here](https://i.imgur.com/NLHbI93.png). Since it's not even showing up as a device in BIOS or Windows, I suspect it is a hardware issue of some kind such as a loose connection or faulty card. And since it would require taking off the I/O cover to physically troubleshoot it, I would recommend returning the motherboard for a different one or pursuing warranty support. Unless you are comfortable doing that kind of work yourself, then I would try removing the I/O cover and reseating the WiFi card and antennae (word of caution: you will likely void your warranty if you do this, especially if you cause any damage in the process).\n\nedit: wording",
      "Try to make sure WiFi is enabled in the BIOS/UEFI setup. It might be disabled for some reason which would cause it to not show up at all in Device Manager. If that's not it, then I would suggest booting a Live Linux distro, if you know how to do that. If not, then it might be defective and need replaced.",
      "Is it like wifi card included or its in the motherboard.",
      "have you gone to your mobo site and downloaded the wifi drivers?",
      "Have you updated the BIOS and firmware?",
      "Go into the bios and make sure they havent turned it off",
      "I had the same issue with my Aorus B450 Pro Wifi until I properly installed the black pieces that come with it. You may also be too far from your Wifi or selecting a wrong version of the wifi",
      "Get a USB wifi adapter if the onboard one doesn't get solved.",
      "Did you install wifi drivers? Some built in wifi needs drivers to run.",
      "While it's possible that you're missing drivers, it's unlikely.  Since there is no unknown device detected, there's a chance that chipset drivers are missing, but from what Device Manager is showing, it looks like chipset drivers are installed, so it's not likely a driver issue, chipset or wifi.\n\nNext thing to check would be that you have the bus enabled.  This might show up as Wifi/Wireless device or it might be bundled as Bluetooth/Wifi/WLAN.  It might also just show up as PCIe or M.2 slot to be enabled.\n\nIf those are enabled or there is no such option, then you will have to look at reseating the card.  Someone mentioned earlier that this card is under a I/O cover.  Not sure how involved it would be to get to it, usually, it's not that complicated.  Might be worth a try.  \n\nIt would be a big pain in the ass to try to get warranty work done through an offshore box manufacturer.  If you have to ship it back, you might be on the hook for shipping to and from, which would probably cost more than what a USB wireless card would cost you.  If they have you take it to a local repair shop, that might be easier (assuming they're paying for the repairs).  \n\nIf you have to RMA the motherboard to Gigabyte, you'd essentially be taking apart and putting a new PC together."

      "If you can to double check your GPU isn't dead take it to a computer shop or test it in another machine.\n\nUnfortunately with computers one problem doesn't necessarily mean it's that one thing.\n\nBut you usually gotta say ok it was working before what did I change and usually from there you can figure out what's going on.\n\nIn my case I was constantly getting freezing in my fps games for ages I thought it was my graphics card so I updated the card same deal, I was told by so many people that my card wasn't getting enough power..\n\nI ended up going through a massive quest to find out what the hell is causing my issue, turns it was my hard drive replaced that never froze since :)\n\nIn your case just sounds like it's not seated properly good luck let's us know how you go :)",

Use that to narrow down your potential problems.",

These are often overlooked, and are the cause of many \u201cgremlin\u201d problems.\n\nEither way, good luck and keep us posted!"

And if you were interested in what this program is trying to do in the first place, I'd say it's about time for a regular reformat anyway.

    "post": "Hello Reddit,\n\nTl;dr:\nAmazon account compromised, now getting hundreds of account confirmation emails as well as ticket submissions to sites I've never visited.\n\nI got hacked today, and it's left me feeling very confused.\n\nMy first heads up was when I woke up, I had a couple  emails in my notifications from different sites with the standard account confirmation links. Thing is, I didn't sign up to any of them. Weird, but I have to get ready for class so I'll just deal with it later.\n\nThen maybe an hour ago, I got a notification from Amazon that one of my orders payments got declined. Immediate heart racing as I haven't made an order in a week. Low and behold, there was a $812 projector ordered off of my Amazon at 5:47am and shipped to a person of my same name in tennesee (I'm in the north east).\n\nSo for sure the hacker got access to my Amazon account. I went through the standard motions, changed the password, removed all payment methods (he must of used an expired method), and called Amazon to place my account on hold. They suggested I change my email password as well.\n\nHere's where I'm left feeling confused. I'm no stranger SQL injection, I'm assuming that I used my same email/pass combo on some insecure server that guy hacked, and now he's running wild and got a hit on my Amazon. Thankfully I had the insight to not use that same password for my email. As far as I know, my email (gmail) has not been compromised.\n\nSo the weird part is that from last night, until about an hour ago, I have probably 150 different account confirmation emails from sites I never signed up for. They're coming in such quick succession it almost makes me think he's using an automated script. Also, I have multiple emails from some of these sites responding to support tickets he submitted to the sites.\n\nWhat's the angle? Why is he using my email to sign up for all of these services? It would literally take me weeks to reach out to all these sites. What should I do next. Did a quick Google search, and I've never even heard of this, so any advice is better than I've got.",

      "You have to understand that your computer isn't just using the physical RAM to store data, but also space on your hard drive. In low-RAM availability conditions, your system will free up currently unused RAM aggressively to allow for other programs to use it. When you had 8GB, with 10 to 15 tabs open, the OS would swap some of those tabs resources out to the hard drive to free RAM and keep the system from slowing to a crawl. You'd notice this when you swapped tabs, and it took time to come up while your disk worked. With 16GB, that's not needed, and the inactive tabs can be kept in memory so when you swap to them, they come up quickly with little to no disk IO.   \n\n\nWhat you really should be wondering here is whether or not your system is snappier with the extra 8 GB of RAM. It should be. If it's not, you might need to look to SuzukiSen's question and swap out your memory modules to match the ones you already have, if you can. At least, see if you can match the onboard memory's speed and timings even if you can't match manufacturer. ",

I haven't had a chance to use it, but based on the post it seems pretty awesome and automates everything you'll probably see here! Credit to /u/vocatus for creating the software.",
      "Everybody has their favorites and that's great if they work.\n\n-  Malwarebytes is almost universally recommended, and with good reason.  It's definitely on my list.\n\n-  I still recommend and use AVG Free.  If you choose the correct custom install options and are willing to configure it post installation, it's not invasive, is fairly light on resources (not as good as it used to be though), and just as effective as any other definitions-based AV.  The rootkit scanning tool is actually quite good in my experience.  In addition, even if you don't like AVG, they do provide the AVG Rescue CD for free, which can help you out of a bind if the system is non-bootable.  It's got decent tools to make registry edits, test RAM, and control services.\n\n-  Spybot Search and Destroy has tried to make itself into a full-fledged piece of security software, which it fails at.  It's very intrusive and not geared toward the average user.  What is still great about Spybot is the Immunization feature, and the ability to scan non-active registry hives, even those present on external disks (or any other non-active partition).  To this day I get several calls a year from users saying 'Such and such message just appeared telling me that X website is unsafe.'  They are almost always going to online poker (or some other gambling), warez/pirated software link aggregation sites, or *occasionally* some porn sites run by scammers.  Immunization really does make a difference (especially the hosts file blacklisting), and it's easy enough to turn off all the other features of Spybot that want to run in the background.\n\n-  I see this recommended so rarely I wonder if it is the dark horse of anti-malware/spyware software:  SuperAntiSpyware.  Yes the name is cheesy and the website is a little dated, but this program just plain works.  Not only is it a very good tool to clean systems up, it can readily help you neutralize both PUC's (potentially unwanted changes) and PUP's (potentially unwanted programs).  In addition, it offers some powerful repair tools for things like the TCP/IP stack and explorer shell, both of which can save you time in getting the machine working properly after a particularly nasty infection.\n\n-  Hijack This is still useful, although I use it rarely.  I see someone else recommending a similar tool from M$, I'll be sure to check it out.\n\n-  MSE/Windows Defender are used in situations where there was particularly bad malware.  No AV or anti-malware/spyware software cleans a machine 100% by itself, and those few times when the combo of AVG, MBAM and SAS somehow continue to return positives after the first round of scans, Microsoft's solutions are an easy way to get another angle on the issue.\n\nOnce I know the machine is clean, of course there are the rounds of driver updates and Windows Updates, also you'll want to make sure that things like Flash and Java, and web browsers, MS Office/Open Office/Libre Office, and any critical user software (Quickbooks, Peachtree, Adobe CS, etc.) are all up to date.\n\nWhat then?\n\nIt's optimization time, that's what!\n\n-  Ccleaner is a time saver, and a good one at that.  You can do everything it does manually, but why bother?  Pair it up with ccenhancer and it becomes quite a bit more powerful as well.  The ability toremove buggy software from the Programs and Features (or Add/Remove for you XP diehards) list is nice, the registry cleanup is 99% (not 100%) reliable, and you can jettison unwanted startup items and browser extensions from one interface.\n\n-  I don't like Auslogics BoostSpeed, it's a gimmick.  I do very much like two other pieces of software they make, however.  Those are Auslogics Disk Defrag and Auslogics Registry Defrag.  If you're fortunate enough to have an SSD, Disk Defrag will be of limited to no use to you.  If you're on a hard disk as your system disk or you have a lot of data stored on a hard disk as a non-active partition, it does it's job very well.  VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) compatible, and the ability to move system files to the inside tracks of your hard disk both make this utility a cut above other defrag software I've used as far as the noticeable performance benefits you get out of that defrag.  For Registry Defrag, results are mixed.  Sometimes there are quite a few optimizations it can make (usually in older systems or systems with gobs of applications installed), which can reduce boot times and improve overall system responsiveness.  In other cases there's nothing for it to do because a particular user has a spartan view of PC use software-wise.  It's usefulness warrants the meager 6mb it inhabits on my flash drive by all accounts.\n\n-  Disable Hibernation.  Just do it.  If you're on an SSD, set Sleep Mode to your liking.  If you're running from a hard disk, disable both.  Clearly notebooks and tablets will want to keep sleep enabled.\n\n-  If you're on a desktop, disable any kind of link state or interval based power saving options for SATA, USB, and PCIe.  They aren't going to save you much power, and at worst you find your device doesn't like having the power cut and refuses to work until you reboot.\n\n-  Disable Executive Paging.  At one time this was the single most noticeable 'tweak' you could make to Windows to improve responsiveness.  In a fast system with an SSD, it's effects aren't very noticeable.  I still do it out of habit.\n\n-  Disable QOS for your network adapters.  QOS is meant to juggle available bandwidth on your network, prioritizing certain kinds of traffic and slow others as needed.  Unless you have a lot of devices (more than 4) sharing wifi and trying to do bandwidth intensive tasks all the time, QOS won't help you.\n\n-  Disable System Restore.  Delete all previous restore points.  Just turn that f*c%e& off.  It harbors viruses and malware (or portions of them), it rarely provides a solution to any meaningful problem, and it lulls end users into a false sense of security in believing they have a magic reset button or a backup.  System Restore is neither.  Not only this, but it eats up (sometimes very limited and valuable) disk space, as well as what is very precious disk I/O if you're on a standard hard disk.  Driver rollbacks have their place, but that's nothing you can't do manually almost as quickly.  Registry backups aren't a bad idea by any means, but they don't do much on their own.  Real men make backups.  Be a real man, turn this junk off and make a backup.\n\n-  I'm sure everyone knows this, but disable unnecessary startup items.  In addition, it is quite safe to trim unnecessary third-party services as well.  Did you just install an HP Laserjet for someone's home office for a single machine?  HP doesn't need to phone home, offer printer ink purchases, or any kind of updates to the user.  Leave the printer driver running, turn the rest of the junk off.  Adobe Update Manager and Java Quickstarter are very safely disabled as well.\n\n-  Turn off Windows Write-Buffer Flushing.  If you don't know what that is, check your hard disk in Device Manager.\n\n-  Make sure you have the latest BIOS!  Especially in notebooks, an updated BIOS can mean more battery life, a cooling/quieter running system, and sometimes enhanced compatibility and stability.  There are almost never downsides to updating the BIOS, as long as the power doesn't go out...\n\n-  If it's an older system, configure the BIOS to make sure that the Parallel port is set to ECP mode w/DMA.  Make sure USB 2.0 is configured correctly.  Make sure AHCI is enabled for SATA disks and that IDE disks are using the highest UDMA mode available.  There are other things that can enhance performance to small degrees as well, but these are the three that make the biggest difference if you're dealing with some ancient P4 or similar.\n\n-  Disable indexing of your hard disks.  Windows search is good, and it's not slow w/o indexing.  Indexing just adds overhead to the pathetic seeks times of a hard disk.  Turn it off, the small but constant junk of performance that you get back is worth it.  On a fast SSD system, you won't see a difference.\n\n-  Finally, clean that machine!  CPU's throttle with heat, GPU's throttle with heat, PSU's die with heat, etc.  Dust and lint buildup helps trap heat in the system.  A cool system is a happy system.\n\nI keep a rather large flash drive loaded with these tools and gobs and gobs more stuff like service packs, codecs, some commonly used third party apps, hardware probing/testing, etc.  PM if you'd like a complete list of the **Tools of the Computer Gods v3.11 Second Edition Service Pack6a**.\n\n*Edit - Content:  \nDisable any and all network adapters when doing your virus/malware scans.

Currently I'm paying for a 250 mbps plan but when I do internet speed tests it's giving me a max of like 10 mbps. What gives? If I'm only getting 10mbps anyway, should I just drop down to the much cheaper 15mbps plan? Or would I end up with the equivalent fraction of the total speed I pay for?\n\nMy boyfriend and I typically have 4 devices around (more if we have guests but that is rare), and mostly use the internet for browsing/email, watching Netflix/other streaming, video chatting, and very very occasionally downloading movie files. I am thinking about starting to use gaming emulators but haven't looked into it really, not sure if that impacts anything. What internet speed do we really need?\n\nEdit: I haven't called my ISP yet because we passed the 1-year mark and our promotional price is now gone, which means we've had a $35/month price jump in our service. I'm trying to see if it's worth downgrading to save some $$$\n\nSorry if this is not the best subreddit for this question - I wasn't sure where else to ask.",

    "bestcomment": [
      "So to summarize, in rough order:\n\n* Make sure it's Mbps not MBps (factor of 8 difference)\n* Verify upload/download\n* Verify you're definitely paying for 250 mpbs\n* Do the tests hardwired\n* Reboot modem\n* Reboot router\n* Check that it's a DOCSIS 3.0 modem\n* Lastly, call ISP and complain.  They'll make you jump through all the same hoops.",
      "Probably not of much help for you but  be careful to differentiate between MB and Mb",
      "Call your ISP and explain this to them and take screenshots of your speeds. I know it's probably a dumb question but the 250 is usually for the download, and upload is usually around 10. Make sure you distinguish which you are looking at. \n\nBut yea call the ISP, then can help you by getting you the speeds you pay for, or by bringing your plan down to what you are getting now. ",
      "Are you confusing mega-bits for mega-bytes? Your internet connection speed is rated in mega-bits per second (Mbps). Your download speeds are often measured in mega-bytes per second (MBps). These are two very different things. \n\nTo put in perspective, I have a perfectly good internet connection of 25 Mbps. My downloads average out at around 2.6-3.1 MBps. Everything is working exactly as intended. So, if your connection speed is 250 mbps, then I would expect your max download speed to be somewhere around 25 megabytes per second. However, be aware that you cannot download anything faster than the site you are connected to can send it. For instance, if you were downloading something from my mini-server in my home, you won't download any faster than my connection speed would allow, which will be less than the speed you are paying for. There is a great deal of stuff out there that you are not going to be able to download at your full maximum speed. What you will benefit from is the amount of bandwidth you have will allow you to do a lot of different things at once and not suffer any limitations with your connection. For instance, you can stream a movie at 4k, download a bunch of games on steam, and have someone else steaming a video in another room all at once without anyone running out of bandwidth. ",

      "If you changed your password already then you should make sure you disable WPS on your router. There is an easy way to exploit WPS on a lot of routers to brute force it's 8 digit PIN to get your password. If your router can be exploited through WPS PIN brute force then it doesn't matter if you use WPA/WPA2 or how complicated your password is. Disable WPS just to be safe and change your password again.",
      "What is likely happening is that a device connected to your network is sucking all the bandwitdht. Your ISP would not be able to help in that case. However, a rep should be able to tell you if you are using all your bandwitdh, he wouldn't be able to tell which device exactly, but he should be able to see that your line is congest.\n\nFirst thing you need to do is unplug your router, and plug in your modem directly into 1 computer. If the connection still sucks, this is either an issue with the modem (could be faulty) or with your line, in either case, your ISP should be able to help. This is a test that they should have done with you when you called.\n\nYou should try to do that with 2 different computers to make sure that the one you used isn't also the one causing the issue.\n\nIf the internet is fine while only your computer is connected, it means that an other device is using all your bandwidth and slowing everyone down. Could be one of yours, could be someone who was able to connect to your wi-fi.\n\nHere is what I would suggest\n\n1) Make sure your Wi-fi is secured and using wpa2 (or wpa) encryption. If you are using WEP, you need to change that as it is no longer secured and can be hacked. However, some Nintendo devices (3ds mainly) can only connect to WEP so it might cause issue in the futur.\n\nYou could also change the name of the wifi to something else, try avoir anything with your name or address in it in order to throw people off. There is no point in make your SSID invisible has there are hundreds of software who will detect it anyways and it will just complicate things in your end.\n\n\n2) Change the password used to connect to the admin interface of your router. By default, most model will have a blank password or use \"admin\". If possible, it would also be a good idea to change the name of your admin account to something else than admin.\n\nIf after changing the passwords for both the wifi and the router everything works fine, then great, it means that whoever was using the wifi no longer have access. If it doesn't keep going because it means it's one of your devices.\n\n3) Start connecting your devices one by one and check if the internet starts to slow down. When I say devices, it means computers, phones, tablets, gaming consoles, etc. Once the internet slow down, it means you connected the device that is caussing the issue. Could be a computer that is infected, downloaing/uploading data, a console trying to download a 60 gb game, etc. You are going to have to find out what is happening with that device.\n\n\n\nNow, if you are forced to use WEP for your wifi, there is an other thing that you can do, it's a bit annoying but it could help.\n\nYour router should have a table of all the devices that ever connected. If it doesn't, it will at least have a table of all that the devices that are currently connected. This table with have the MAC address of the devices. A MAC address is unique, no device in the world will have the same. \n\nYou should clear those table to start fresh and then find out the MAC of all your devices and make sure that those are the only one listed there.\n\nLastly, once you can enable a MAC filtering. This means that unless you went into the router and whitelisted the mac address of a devince, it wont be able to connect. It may take a while to set up all your devices but once it's done, it shouldn't change often unless you buy an other computer or phone.\n\nThe annoying part with MAC filtering is that if someone come over and want to use the wifion their phones/computers, you will need to find the MAC of the devices and then whitelist them on the router.\n\nAlso, someone people will tell you that MAC filtering is useless because a MAC can be spoofed or cloned easily, which is true. However, it would be hard for someone to know which MAC you whitelisted without have access to your router. Someone with those skill would most likely not be waisting his time hijacking residential internet.\n\nedit : I forgot to mention, make sure you don't have a guest network enable. Also, some ISP will have their router setup so that other clients can use your network. If you can't turn that shit off, you need to change your router and modem.",
      "This does not answer how they got on your Wi-Fi.

So while at school we check and see something like timewarnerwifi. Install a Time Warner app and he puts in his home account info and he connects.

The first thing that started happening is very minor and just confusing a bit, is that now when I open a link, instead of waiting for the official title of the page to load, it immediately displays the URL as the title instead. Some time later this evolved into the fact that about 40% of the time, pages get stuck in loading, until I tell Firefox to go there again. Another thing that started happening a bit later, is that about half the time, when I close a tab, a ghost tab remains, by which I mean that the space for the tab is still there as if the tab was still open, which can mess with how everything is set up, or when I'm used to doing things a certain way and speed.\n\nEDIT: Actually, ever since I tried testing to see if it was addons, I haven't seen any of the problems(apart from the minor thing, which is probably a feature) so I have no idea what happened, or if it's going to happen again, but right now I can't do anything regarding this.\nAnyone else having this problem?

      "I think you should get an SSD because hard drives are much slower then SSDs. When it freezes, the disk is trying to catch up to what you're doing because its too slow. SSDs do that job way better and besides that, they can boot up your PC much quicker, load your games much quicker and have less failure rates as it doesn't run from a spinning disk. I recommend the Crucial MX500 and it has nice speeds and nice value as well. You should also monitor your RAM as when the RAM is all used it will put the workloads on the hard drives, which are way slower than the RAM, therefore bottlenecking your PC. SSDs might help, but if the RAM goes to 100% constantly, I'd recommend you to upgrade your RAM.",
      "I vote graphics driver. More ram and an ssd couldn't hurt, but I don't think that's the issue",
      "Could be heat, monitor, cable (VGA, DVI, HDMI, Display Port, whatever you use) and especially the graphics card seems to be important to me.\n\nTry other cables, other ports on your computer (for example HDMI if you used VGA) and try to eliminate every possible thing it could be.\n\nFor heat, get some heat monitoring software, check your BIOS/UEFI menu for thermal throttling, use programs like After Burner (which is for overclocking your graphics card) to just increase your GPU fan speed, check your BIOS/UEFI menu for more fan speed settings, etc.\nBtw, increasing fan speed is not bad for your computer in almost any way, even if it is super loud and you are thinking \"this can't be good\". That's probably the only downside. It's more loud.\nOf course, if you have your fan running on 100% at all time for years, it will eventually die sooner. But I would rather want a dead fan than a dead cpu or gpu.. \n\nEdit: I remember having long freezes on my laptop, which should have great performance (i7 @ 4,3 GHz, 16GB RAM and a GTX 1070 ti.. It was the HDD. I still don't know to this day, if windows just really hates HDD's or if the HDD was defect.. It took over 10 minutes to just boot and login.. Not just because of the boot, but the login screen was always frozen for minutes.. Try a SSD for your Windows to run on. Could be a game changer.\n\nIf you can't find the problem, maybe try a Linux live boot from a USB stick (download an iso file of a Linux distribution of your choice, use the program Rufus to make a bootable USB stick out of it, boot your computer from the USB stick. You can find tutorials on it everywhere). Make sure to use Live Boot and not to install Linux. Live Boot will not override your windows installation in any way. It is a temporary Linux session running on your USB stick. You could mount your HDD tho, as Linux can read Windows NTFS, but you should not edit stuff on the HDD from your Linux session. There is a low chance of corrupting files you edit, so Linux can still work with them but windows can't. So just leave your HDD alone ;) \n\nIf Linux works fine, then it could be a driver issue or even Windows. If so, I would recommend a full wipe and clean install. You can do this by using the same USB stick you used for Linux and using the Windows Media Creation Tool to make a bootable windows USB stick. In the windows setup after boot, you can then wipe your HDD and clean install Windows on it.\n\n\n\n\nThis has nothing to do with your problem anymore, but just some advice for the future, if you want to keep editing videos and doing performance heavy stuff in general:\n\nUpgrading the amount of RAM will give your computer the ability to keep more stuff... Well, in RAM. For example, After Effects does this. After you watch your video in the preview (this is called pre-rendering), After Effects keeps this part in RAM. If it is in RAM, you can watch your preview smoothly, cause the video is already temporarily available in RAM and does not have to be rendered again. After Effects indicates this with a green line above your time-line. So, more RAM allows you, in terms of video editing, to have more of your video preview pre-rendered so you can watch it smoothly and edit on it without it lagging. Or you could also just say: Your green line can be longer. Lol\nBtw: A blue line means, that After Effects has this part of the video cached on your drive. This is still way slower than reading it from RAM (cause HDD's and also SSD's are way slower than RAM) but it's still faster than After Effects rendering it again. Going to a spot in your video where the line is blue, After Effects will read the cached video from the drive and put it into RAM. The line becomes green again. The part that was previously green should become blue, so cached in drive, if After Effects needs more RAM. If you have much RAM and a short video, you could potentially have the whole video pre-rendered in RAM. \n\nUpgrading your graphics card is also good for video editing. Adobe stuff (and many other programs) use hardware acceleration. So, if you render your video, After Effects can use your graphics card for rendering, which is way faster than your CPU. Upgrading your GPU = Faster rendering (this means that your preview is also rendering faster, of course)",

      "Out of curiosity, what are your average temps for both CPU and GPU while you are gaming?\n\nMost automatic fan curves are going to turn on full-tilt once you go beyond 60C or so, which is almost guaranteed with any modern games.  \n\nI have a fairly beastly gaming laptop as well that is a couple of years old now but it has an i7-7700hq and a GTX 1070.  When I play older games, sometimes the fans don't even need to ramp up at all since that hardware is overkill.  However, any more recent games are going make the CPU/GPU run hot and it will ramp the fans up pretty high.  With my laptop, even when my fans are about 80% speed, they are still almost as loud as 100% speed.  \n\nIt's just the nature of the beast with gaming laptops and there isn't much you can do about it, and if you force your fans to run slower you run a risk of damaging your hardware as it will get extremely toasty under the hood since laptops are hard to cool by design anyway.\n\nOne thing I've had to do with my laptop is to prevent my CPU from boosting (it seems you have done this too by setting it to 90% power) and I have to run a balanced power plan in windows and run Adaptive on my GPU in the NVCP.  \n\nWhen I have my CPU running at 100% and also my GPU running at 100%, I'm pretty much guaranteed to get thermal throttling when gaming which is *extremely* annoying.  It's all due to the heat.\n\nI've also installed MSI Afterburner software and I've downclocked both my GPU core clock and the memory clock.  I took a hit on fps in some games, but nothing too dramatic, and now my temps are fully under control with no threat of throttling or crashing.  \n\nMy temps on both CPU/GPU run right around 70C with fans on full blast while playing any modern games.  The most recent games I've played are Rise and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Arkham Knight.  With FPS capped at 60 (my monitor is only 60 so I don't really have a choice) I can run graphics settings on either High or Ultra.  \n\nI will say, however, that it took me a *long* damn time to figure everything out with my laptop as I would overheat/throttle constantly the first few months I had my laptop.  Once I got the throttling under control, I still experienced random crashes at various times for seemingly no reason as my temps were below threshold.  \n\nWhat I found out is that both the CPU and GPU were so powerful with their default clocks that it was causing thermal throttling on the CPU until I turned off boost, and until I turned my GPU core/memory clocks down in Afterburner, I would get random complete system crashes/reboots while gaming.",

You can pay up and hope that they restore your files for you, you can restore from backups or you can nuke it from orbit.\n\nIt's been the bane of business techs for several months now. Unlike most viruses that will lock you out of your computer, Cryptolocker actually encrypts your whole hard drive and will only revert if you pay up. \n\nNormal viruses will just stop you from using the computer but leave your stuff the same, this one actually changes it so that it's unusable.  That's why antiviruses won't do anything, because they don't have the information to get it back. That information is actually hidden somewhere on the internet so it's out of reach.\n\n/r/sysadmin has a really good reference thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1p32lx/cryptolocker_recap_a_new_guide_to_the_bleepingest/) if you'd like to read a bit more in-depth on Cryptolocker.\n\nTo recap: restore from backups, an antivirus isn't going to do anything because this is a totally new kind of virus known as ransomware.\n\nEDIT: goofed the link formatting.",
      "As a few others have stated, your friend appears to have been infected with the CryptoLocker Virus that has been doing the rounds for a while now. Removing the Virus is very simple and Malwarebytes can do this as can many of other AV's out there. Removing the encryption though isn't possible and the files are unrecoverable as it creates a Public and Private Key, the latter is created and stored on the C&C Server.\n\nYou can opt to pay via BitCoin to decrypt the data, after which the CryptoLocker writer/s will send you a decryption key (Private Key) to decrypt your data. The Private Key is created on the C&C server, whilst the public key resides in your registry. Without the Private Key, there is no way to recover the files. There have been people that have stumped up and paid to get their files back, but you really have to weigh the cost of the data against the price that the decryption key now costs. I believe that some of the people that actually paid, had data that far outweighed the cost of getting the Private Key, and did so as a last resort. I would definitely recommend NOT paying the ransom. Last time I looked at the price that the virus writers were charging for the Private Key (Decryption Key) it was 10BTC, which equates to $8,373.00 (USD) at the current exchange price.\n\nThat said, you mentioned in the comments below that he already has the data backed up, so I would do a complete Clean Install.\n\nWhen you have re-installed for him, one of the first things I would install is a decent AV and Malwarebytes (preferably Pro)\n\nAlso, I would download and install the [CryptoPrevent Tool](http://www.foolishit.com/vb6-projects/cryptoprevent/) that was written by Nick Shaw of FoolishIT.com. The tool is completely free, but there is also a paid version that will automatically update the tool in the background when updates are available, plus it will run a scheduled test every now and then and email you that it is still working as expected.\n\nI wrote about [using the tool here](http://www.techfleece.com/2013/11/07/prevent-cryptolocker-virus-infecting-computer/) if you want to take a look, that will show you more about how it works and some of the other functions. The article is now a few months old and the tool has since been [updated to v 4.3.](http://i.imgur.com/wC3IqmK.jpg)\n\nTake a look at the writer of the CryptoPrevent Tool's page to see the latest updates, plus to download it.\n\n",

The result of this is that your roommate also has a log of all DNS queries, just like your ISP or google or whoever you use as a dns resolver does.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: if you\u2019re sharing your internet on a local network and you have run of he mill consumer gear, he could have just done some other things to completely slurp up 100% of all the traffic and you\u2019d never know it.\n\nIf you are concerned that your network is untrusted because of other network users, the answer is to use a VPN, period. That is the whole reason companies have policies to force their employees to use a VPN that tunnels all traffic through the VPN connection, regardless of the destination. They want to reduce the possibility that operating their company business on an untrusted network (basically any network the company doesn\u2019t own and operate) will not result\nIn inadvertent leaking of company information.\n\nFundamentally your issue is one of trust. If you don\u2019t trust your roommate then you you need to isolate your Internet usage from your roommate\u2019s influence as much as possible. This means trusting a (not a bird) third party like a VPN service, or you yourself learning enough to be able to reduce your reliance on that trust.

Anyone that has a DNS server CAN spy on your browsing without protection. But it is unlikely he is gluing himself to logs or really cares that you like big black MILFs or whatever. On top of that he can only see history, not passwords or anything like that. It's hardly a security rish\n\nIf you live with a tech savvy person you have to get used to the fact that they can pretty much spy on anything you do on a network unless you break out the tin foil hat and load up on a VPN/tor for EVERYTHING, encrypt your DNS, etc. You have to trust them NOT to.\n\nYou have to trust a person to let them on your network. If you dont trust them that much, you shouldnt be living with them.\n\n\nJust a personal example, I do that much and MORE on my home network. My room mate is aware, and even encourages it for my learning. He let me actually break into his computer when the Windows SMB bug was found. /shrugs \n\n\ntl;dr \nIf you don't trust them to not spy on you, you shouldn't live with them. If you trust them, them saying that is no different than someone who set up security cameras for security saying they *CAN* use it to spy on you. Of course they can, but ARE they? Would they?"

    "post": "EDIT: hey people from /r/techsupport. Before you waste your time trying to help out, I ended up bricking the computer. There is nothing I can do. Guess I officially belong to /r/techsupportgore now.\n\n**Introduction**\n\ntoday I promised to repair a family computer. They told me it had a \"virus\" and that it was doing \"weird things\". So they gave me the computer for me to take a look at. I don't really know what computer this is exactly, which is making this really hard for me. It's the HP pavilion G7-xxxx xx. but I have no idea which one.\n\n**Main ordeal**\n\nWhen I first investigated the computer I already noticed that it was literally riddled with malware, so my first instinctive reaction was to download malwarebytes and restart in safe mode. \n\nWhen I rebooted the computer with the safe mode setting turned on all I got was a black screen. \nSafe mode is literally the LAST thing that should brick a computer, so something else here is at play.\n\nI have no way to enter the bios, pressing the delete key upon bootup gives me nothing. There is no splash screen either. My theory is that a piece of malware somehow bricked the computer when it noticed I turned on safe mode. It would have to be very deeply embedded in the system, like a rootkit. This is very rare though, so I don't know if that's what happened.\n\nIt was working \"fine\" until I touched it .-.\n\n**More information**\n\nI took out the hard disk, and I found all the data was still intact. I get a \"different\" darker black screen if I take out the ram, so that's all I can do to verify that the ram is working.\n\nThe hard disk has a partition called HP_TOOLS, so I googled this. Apparently there is a way to recover your bios if it is somehow damaged. All you have to do is press windows+g. I tried this, but all it does is ramp up the fans. You can also do this from a USB, but I've had no luck since I have no idea what model computer this is. I did try a random pavilion G7 bios and USB activity LED did indeed turn on, but I don't get anything on screen.\n\nConnecting an external display through hdmi also doesn't give me anything\n\nplease help\n\nUPDATE: just disassembled the entire computer in order to unplug the cmos battery.\nlets see what happens next\n\nUPDATE 1.5: I cut myself trying to disassemble this thing. HP really enjoys making it a pain in the dick to open their products up...\n\nUPDATE 2: I reassembled the computer but it's no longer turning on at all. like, no power. I think I messed something up. This is surprising to me since I follow an instruction manual. I think I'm calling it quits. It's been a fun ride... Rest in peace HP laptop. Not that it really matters, the difference between bricked and dead is neglectible.\n\nUPDATE 3: i'm sorry ... I marked it as completed becuase I've given up on the sodding laptop. Feel free to give suggestions but I don't think there's anything that hasn't been said. I'm leaving the story up for sheer entertainment. If you want more info check my reply to /u/tartantangents",

Sometimes they get loose and a little pressure on top is all it needs. The bios chip is usually one of the larger square chips on top of the motherboard. If you're not sure which just try them all, can't hurt.\n\nAs far as the no power thing you might have just plugged one of the lcd light indicators in the wrong spot. As long as the power supply is connected to the motherboard it's probably getting power. Those plugs usually only fit where they're supposed to.\n\nIf the bios chip trick didn't work you can try a more drastic solution. Pre heat your oven to 275f and setup the motherboard on a cookie sheet using something like aluminum balls to separate the board and the cookie sheet. Just make sure anything touching the motherboard is touching parts that aren't important, like the area you would put screws in. Small wooden nubs work good too. Put that in the oven 10 - 15 minutes and let it cool down before you reassemble.\n\nSounds crazy I know but what you're doing is soldiering connections that have worn out on the motherboard. Likely a connection that's important for the bios chip. Just make sure everything you can strip off the motherboard is off. Don't cook your hd, that's bad, cpu bad...\n\nYes I've done this before and yes it worked and yes a cooked motherboard smells bad fyi.",

If you get beeps, reseat your RAM carefully.\n\n6. If you have 2 or more sticks of RAM, test individually.\n\n7. Tell your family member that their laptop contracted a pr0n virus that over saturated the flux capacitor and the laptop will no longer work. \n\n8.

You'll still need to connect the WiFi to the appropriate network, but that's normal.\n\nWhat isn't normal is that you'll end up with a third adapter, a bridge interface. The bridge interface is your connection (on that system) into the bridged network. This is where your IP for the network will be. Both the wired and wireless network connections will have no IP address configured.\n\nThis is preferable to network connection sharing (as someone else pointed out) because it doesn't require your laptop to do a lot of processing, it just pushes packets.\n\nI don't recommend this for long term use, you should have something set up as a long term solution before too long, but it will get you running until you can figure something else.\n\nBe sure to un-bridge the adapters when you no longer need it to be this way.\n\nGood luck",

If, however we bought a $40 switch, all the ports were 100mbit(or, if you splurged, 1000Mbit)\n\nIt's very likely that you simply are plugged in to a gigabit network and don't need a router at all.  What happens if you plug your computer straight into the network port on the wall?  Do you get the super fast speeds?  If so, go buy a network *switch* and not a router.

You only need a home router if you are only assigned one IP address.  It's very likely they'll give you as many dedicated IP addresses as you need, so the overhead of mapping multiple devices to one IP address is unnecessary.",

You could set up an SSH tunnel, with SSH acting as a SOCKS proxy, and then every application capable of using a SOCKS proxy could use it at blinding speed.\n\nIt was also possible to exploit the traffic shaping policy. HTTPS was in the top priority class, so you could connect to an SSL VPN running on port 443 outside the network, and get whatever speed that VPN system could get. It usually wasn't as fast as the SSH method, because just about anything you could get to run your SSL VPN would be the bottleneck, but it didn't require a SOCKS proxy the way the SSH method did.",
      "I don't know about your school but the university i used to go to had the regular network that was fed normally with dhcp no proxy etc. BUT if you knew the correct proxy information you could route your net through the main connection that the faculty used, after getting that info i went from 3 down 3 up to 120 down 60 up.",

This would speed you up since your router won't need to redouble the efforts already being made by the university's routers, it should help keep cacheing of data to a minimum, and it will also stop you from having nat on nat which is generally a good thing to avoid.\n\nIf you want better wifi signal quality in your room use 5Ghz. It will have less interference from your neighboring rooms since this frequency doesn't travel through solid structures well compared to 2.4Ghz. This will result in fewer collisions and better goodput.\n\nI doubt it, but maybe hacking a higher QoS priority will help.

If you've run power through it at all when it happened, that'll pretty much seal it - think flooding your PC with water and turning it on, but so much worse because it's urine.",

Any higher and you're going to risk melting connectors. To be extra safe, wrap in some paper towels and set on the racks after the oven gets to temp.

Cat pee is extremely destructive.\n\nUsually, if your cat pees on your PC components, you have a maximum of... roughly 10 minutes before extreme corrosion comes kicking down the door. Best thing to do is just wash it. As stupid as that may sound, use something to get the pee away. Don't have any wet wipes laying around, just try spraying water on it. Let it dry, quadruple check everything is dry and then try to boot it.\n\nUsually warranty does not cover any form of liquid damage. So it's doomed already. Might as well try the worst way possible to fix it in case all else goes wrong.\n\nA piece of advice I give everybody who owns a cat is either: Make the room completely off limits to the cat, or at least try to make some form of protection so that the PC never represents a pleasant place for the kitten to sit on. Go ahead, make soft plastic spikes. The second the cat will encounter them she'll just drop it.",

      "The FAT thing and the 4GB limit is a real problem. FAT is only a 32bit system so it can\u2019t handle file sizes larger than 2^32 bytes.

I almost always immediately reformat them as NTFS since I\u2019m using either Windows or Linux. Problem is that macOS doesn\u2019t have native write support for NTFS, but can read it. NTFS works fine on Linux but NTFS doesn\u2019t support the file permissions for everything Linux needs. HFS+ and APFS (macOS default formats) can be read by Linux usually but can\u2019t on Windows without adding some stuff. Ultimately, there needs to be a newer, universal, standard filesystem that will work for all 3 with permissions, read/write, and support for file sizes larger than 2^32 bytes. There\u2019s probably something out there that exists, but getting all the major OSes to agree and add native support is the hard part. ",

You may want to ask about this in r/askelectronics.

Once again if denied \"ask for a corporate case manager or contact\", do not hang up if they tell you to get it yourself, they can and have the means to do this. \n\n5.Then and only once you have this information contact the Corporate site and explain it to them. This is where I was, we teamed with repair centers and engineers to ensure that the customer is not ripped off. Be polite BUT FIRM and demand a repair, and then in matter of fact way you ask and find out ( ensure to know ) the company's lemon policy. That way if you get it back and send it in again and again for poor workmanship on one unit you can get another machine. Most of the time not the same unit, but as good or better and most likely refurbished.\n\n6.

However, I'm a firm believer in the motto \"if you want to feel safe, carry a rabbit's foot. If you want to be safe, carry a .40\". So basically, it's my opinion that you should look into getting a personal firearm and learn how to use it.\n\nI'm not sure where you live, but many states do allow you to conceal carry firearms, and some states have special laws just for females with a stalker. Check your local laws for specifics on concealed/open carry, and see if there is anything on the books for special circumstances regarding restraining orders. \n\nThere are many gun ranges that offer female only, personal defense courses, typically taught by female instructors or law enforcement officers. This way you can become more comfortable with your firearm in a female friendly environment. You can ask questions, talk with the instructors in a relaxed atmosphere, and learn about your weapon, without some dude checking you out.\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable with owning, carrying, or using a firearm for personal defense, you can still look into the pepper spray or tazer, also. But, having the ability and knowledge to use a firearm is very useful, and could potentially save your life. Remember, when seconds count, the cops are only minutes away. Don't ever forget that.\n\nI hope that everything works out for you with this situation and I hope this creep doesn't try to hurt you or your mother. Always be on alert, and be safe!"

98 /dos machine) please consider:\n\n* This is not my PC (it's a request from my dad's friend)\n* If it was mine, making It a retro gaming Notebook (Win 98 / Dos with boxed games and abandonware games) will be what I will go for to replace my old one\n* The Guy that owns it is has little to no money to put on a new or refurbished PC as nearly all is money go to pay his home Loan and medical care bills\n* It needs a system that can at least go to internet (The PC is nearly to be used when it stays at the hospital, and the hospital has free WiFi)\n\nHere are the specs of the machine:\n\nCompaq Presario R3200 with:\n\n* AMD Athlon XP-M 3000+ \"core Dublin\" @1.6Ghz 1C/1T\n* 1280MB RAM PC 2700 (256MB integrated and 1GB SODIMM Stick)\n* 80GB 2.5\" IDE HDD (5400 RPM)\n* Geforce 4 440 Go (part of the Nforce 2/3 chipset Package on the motherboard)\n* latest Bios is installed\n* A DVD drive\n* USB boot is supported (Tested Ok)\n* Before Cleannig the Win XP it was working normally\n\nHere is what I have Done:\n\n* Already passed HDT to check all the internal specs and have the list of Linux kernel module\n* Already passed Memtest with no errors\n* Installed LUbuntu (latest one that supports 32 bits aka 18.04.3 LTS)\n* Tried to install Gentoo\n* Tried to install Arch\n* Tried to install latest Linux Lite OS (downloaded all the 3.x 32 bits lineup)\n* Tried to install ReactOS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe real problem is: \n\nAt First I tried to install the latest 32 bit Gentoo as a test and to see if I can get the most out of this hardware, but for no reason the PC sort of crashed (for easy setup I was gone ssh Style to keep my sanity in check), all the easy setup has gone good but when I compiled the kernel it gone all Wrong, after a bit the PC was near unresponsive, and the HDD status LED has gone crazy (a little before it was the CPU fan) and when I got as little as some response on the machine (not via SSh as it was impossible to connect, putty was locked on a waiting state), i could run top that nearly froze after running it and refreshing like each 20 seconds and saw that all the memory and swap where use up.\n\nThe PC run like that fore more than 18 hours (because work and sleep) and after that I gave up on installing Gentoo (before that I retried but direct on the machine as i needed place on my desktop for some work so no ssh this time and after a while this had gone the same way)\n\nthe only regret that i had is to not install ATOP before running the kernel building to see what was consuming all the RAM \n\nThe specs of L Ubuntu are far inferior that what the PC is capable off to run, it installs but the PC at use is really sluggish and for no reason, the WiFi card was detected, the default kernel module (the same as shown in HDT) is in the module kernel directory but impossible to either detect or connect to a WiFi network as the peripheral doesn't show up.\n\nThe only way to go to internet was to have it plugged in via Ethernet cable and out of the box chromium or midori browsing was a plague and a simple YouTube video (either in 144p /240p / 360p) was running kind of smoothly but had rendering glitches. forcing the old render mode (non html5) with videos uploaded on YouTube more than 10 years ago and with an old version of iceweasel (for some kind of weird state, on old version of firefox couldn't compile)  had the same glitches\n\nTrying the Arch route was nearly cut from the start: ip link whas showing the three interfaces : local loop / ethernet / wifi but impossible to get the network stack functional (I was using the latest dual iso (i486/i686) of Arch Linux 32) the best i could go was to force a static IP and get it to ping [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) and fighting with DNS to properly ping [www.google.fr](https://www.google.fr) but after that the installer kept saying it couldn't run because it can't connect to the server and all arch tutorials (either in \"paper\" or in \"video\" hadn't had this problems (either in the forums) and at first it said it couldn't find the installer (install or setup was not working, only having a \\_setup in the ISO)\n\nWhen Trying to run Linux lite OS, I only once got to have X-org to run and show me the wallpaper but nothing else (was 3.8 version, after the reboot it was dead giveaway as when trying with or without \"nomode\" and removing \"quiet splash\" it never again got x-org running staying locked on \"starting D-Bus\" \n\nThe same problem was with all the other versions of Linux lite OS 3.x lineup and the weird thing is at least the same laptop model is listed on their hardware  database (with same specs) that was running the 3.x series lineup dating of the en of 2018 and other laptops shows with seemingly the same hardware (saw a Sony and Toshiba ones)\n\nIn the end for the Time he will be waiting with a more recent laptop (acer Travelmate 7730) I recently converted to win 10 The Pc had an Bad PSU and HDD was dead for the time I fix his laptop.\n\nFor those who will  say to sell him the travelmate: This laptop was already sold to other people in need for their son for when he will enter middle school the next year for very cheap (I don't get the full refund of what cost me the new PSU and the 320G HDD put in there as i sold it for 30 $ and only the brand new PSU cost me 17 $)\n\nFor now I wonder what route to take:\n\n* Reinstall that security hole that are windows XP and firefox 52 ESR?\n* Try to go suicidal by trying to install a light version of windows 7 /10 32 bits?\n* trying to go the Debian net-install route?\n* try other \"lightweight and old hardware friendly\" versions of Linux?\n* Go LFS Style?\n\nPS: I have some skills in linux but i'm not a full fledged linux user, Linux is not my main OS but mostly a for work one (I have an ubuntu VM , an laptop with easy switchable SSD for Lubuntu / Arch Linux for dev and repair purposes and i take care of several Linux embedded devices (pfsense and a Xen Server that was switched to ESXI ) and as an hobby I play with some raspberry Pi and Likes (Asus Tinker, librecomputer H5 and Banana Pi R2) either for home automation / console retrogaming / and security purposes\n\nPS2: From The PS, is to say that i have done all i know for now and I'm going to be pissed as I alrady passed more than 3 hours of flashing USB drives with either Rufus and Etcher and broke 2 USB old  keys (read write faults) with it.\n\nPS3: i already done after the gentoo install failure (after installing Lubuntu) this command : $ sudo badblocks -v /dev/sda10 > badsectors.txt and no errors were found, and I didn't installed smartmontools as the system doesnt support smart (either tested with hwinfo and sandra 2006 when XP was install and the

For some reason the page was in Russian by default, so because I'm a bit paranoid about stuff like that, I went to my security settings to see if anything was out of place.   \n\nUnder my devices I found my three devices (two phones and my PC), but I noticed there was a fourth there. An unknown device in San Jose, CA, USA that was added in November 2018, with activity as recent as June 14th 2019.   \n\nI live in the UK, so that's obviously not me, but the thing is, I've had two-step authentication enabled since mid 2017. If somebody had tried to log in, I would've been told about it. My two phones each get an alert if any security events happen, and I'd like to think somebody attempting to log in from another country counts.  \n\nSo I'm wondering, could there be a harmless explanation for this?

The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems, but in most cases a thread is a component of a process. Multiple threads can exist within one process, executing concurrently and sharing resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources.\n\nReference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor?wprov=sfti1)\n\n**Multi-core Processor:**\nA multi-core processor is a computer processor integrated circuit with two or more separate processing units, called cores, each of which reads and executes program instructions, as if the computer had several processors. The instructions are ordinary CPU instructions (such as add, move data, and branch) but the single processor can run instructions on separate cores at the same time, increasing overall speed for programs that support multithreading or other parallel computing techniques.\n\nReference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)?wprov=sfti1)\n\nPrograms and processes on your computer can implement multi threading to \u2018divide and conquer\u2019 computational tasks. The scheduler in the OS then dispatches threads to individual cores. If you open up Task Manager in Windows (10) and look at the performance tab, you can see that your computer normally has thousands of threads running.\n\nTherefore, the OP was fine to say that his number of cores were cut in half. True, his number of physical cores has not changed, but the number of logical cores available to him has.",

      "I don't have much experience troubleshooting TVs, but I'm very familiar and have worked on this technology, so here's what I would do to troubleshoot the issue.\n\nGood job ruling out the remote, saves some time but keep the batteries out of it.\n\nUnplug EVERYTHING from your TV.  Nothing should be plugged into it but power.\n\nReduce the volume.  Verify if it goes up again.  This will rule out every other device controlling your volume, and I bet it doesn't go up indicating something is trying to level out your sound and pushing that command to the TV.\n\nIf it does go up again check all the TV settings you can find.  Some have equalization settings as mentioned in another comment.  Reset the TV if possible.\n\nLast but not least, if the issue is the TV, look into a firmware update, if that fails time for repair.\n\nOtherwise, you will be able to plug in one device at a time, and figure out which one is causing your volume to go up.\n\nEdit: Had another thought, very unlikely but it's related to a story.  I saw a video online where some lady was claiming her phone had a \"Mind of it's own,\" and was going through pressing buttons like it was buying something.  I had a similar scenario with my phone at a hotel, and obviously quickly realized it was the power connector I was using.  I had plugged my USB into a pre-supplied USB power outlet, and it was causing odd surges and my phone to start pressing buttons at random.  Swapped to my standard outlet connection, problem went away, problem came back when plugging again into the USB port.\n\nThe point I'm getting at with this edit, although very unlikely at a TV level, power can cause all sorts of odd reactions in PCBs (Printed Control Boards, Motherboards), and could be a faulty outlet, or power cable.  Very unlikely here, but worth trying.",

Netflix is willing to help if i can get a government agency to help, but no one aside from TSA seems to care. If i can just track down the city that my laptop is currently in then it would at least give them a place to start.

      "The first thing I'd do is change the Netflix billing to use a throwaway debit card and cancel the DVD plan - that will help limit any damage to your credit card and hide your home mailing address.  Use an alternate Zip code in the billing page to further secure your personal identity.  Your time for limiting credit card misuse is short, so do this now.\n\nYou want these suckers to keep using your machine so they'll get caught.  That won't happen if you turn off Netflix - it'll probably get sold for beer or drug money (if it hasn't already been once or twice) and you'll never get it back.  The last thing you want is somebody with a clue getting a hold of your personal data.\n\nSecond, confirm the person(s) using your laptop haven't changed your plan - maybe they'll be foolish enough to add a DVD plan with a home address.  You never know!\n\nThird - Go back to the TSA, and tell them you're getting the FBI involved (interstate commerce fraud, for one) then go bug the FBI.  Get a report from them, then go back to Netflix with copies of the FBI and TSA reports - insist they tell you where the laptop is using your service account from.  Once you know that, go to the appropriate State Police Computer Crimes division with everything you've got.  If the laptop is in a major city, go to that police force's computer crimes division as well.  Keep them updated with any new info you get they can use and keep pestering them, weekly.\n\nFourth, blog about it!  Start up a blog detailing your effort to track down your property.  Publicly praise those who help you, and gently shame the ones who won't.  Get your blog noticed, go to the local media.  Local and State police forces love positive media exposure, which the recovery of your laptop will give them.\n\nFinally, contact your laptop manufacturer.  Maybe, just maybe, they might be able to help pinpoint where the machine is if it's using an OEM update utility which phones home.  Have any and all info about the machine handy: Model, Serial number, service tag number, sales invoice number will help.  You need them to pinpoint the state and ISP in writing.",

I had a MSI 1070 Gaming X, and these were some of the troubleshooting steps I tried:\n\nAdding TDRDelay key to the registry.\n\nReseating RAM/GPU\n\nReinstalling Windows, then reinstalling Windows on a new drive\n\nReinstalling GPU drivers, both with clean install and DDU.\n\nPlaying with only one monitor plugged into the GPU.\n\nRolled back GPU drivers back to Oct 2018 release.\n\nTried testing with only one stick of RAM in, alternating each stick.\n\nContacted Nvidia support, who told me to run a stress test for an hour, and if it crashed, the GPU would be bad. Ran it for three hours, no crash.\n\nSwapped out for a different 1070, which did not have any errors or crashes.\n\nI \"solved\" it by getting an RMA on an almost 3 year old GPU.

Just Google quickly how to disable in windows. \n\n\nAlternativly you can try a driver from more than 1 year ago. No guarantee this will work.",

After a couple of hours playing (sometimes even less) the games crashed. For some reason this happened only on certain games (e.g. Battlefield 4).\n\nI ended up buying another graphics card, which completely **solved the problem**.\n\nAfter some research I found that the graphics card couldn't hold his frequency on a stable level and apparently certain games can't handle this.\n\nWhat I tried:\n\n\\- down clocking the card (which helped a bit but the games were still crashing after a couple of hours)\n\nWhat I did not try:\n\nSome users reported that down volting would help, but I didn't try it as that means that your warranty nullifies!",

It's been 6 months since then (I accidentally ordered the wrong replacement adapter so it took 2 repair shops to realize that).\n\nAnyway, I finally got the computer back up and running with the proper adapter but upon loading games I started getting really bad screen artifacts. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling my drivers. I tried rolling back to previous versions of my drivers. Windows 10 is completely updated. I don't think it's a monitor issue. I hooked the computer up to a tv via HDMI and I was still getting the artifacts. Additionally, the artifacts are visible in screenshots that I take in-game. All this leads me to believe it's a problem with the Graphics Card.\n\nMy question is if there's anything besides the GC this could point to? And if it is the GC, does anyone know if that can be replaced in this computer (I'm aware that MOST laptops can't have their GC or GPU replaced, but i thought I might as well see)? And how would this happen when it hasn't been use for months and was stored safely?

I think I had done something that after restarting and uninstalling the drivers I did a windows update that also prompted an nvidia update.

If it's RAM, that can save you a lot of money and headaches so worth the time to check it out.\n\nIf it's the GPU, you can look into getting a replacement part, it has to be exact - made for your laptop, laptop GPUs don't tend to be standardized, and cannot be interchanged like desktop parts.\n\nIf the GPU cannot be replaced, you might be able to disable to disable the GPU and use the GPU in the CPU.  This will be much less powerful, and you probably won't be able to game with it, but you'll still have a working laptop.\n\nAlso, one last thought.  Make sure the replacement adapter is supplying enough power.  It could be that the GPU is power starved and throwing up artifacts because of it.  Again, unlikely, but worth the investigation.",

      "Wipe is sometimes the best option to be sure it's clean.",
      "Hard to say what they put on it. If you have the time I'd backup any important data and wipe the whole machine. Otherwise do a scan with the anti virus that's on the machine along with malwarebytes.",
      "Although doing a complete wipe\\reinstall can be a daunting task it can often be the quicker option as you can spend many many hours trying to clean an infected machine only to miss a small part of the infection and find that suddenly you're back to square one as that missed part reinfects the entire machine\n\nOthers have already pointed you in the direction of doing a reinstall so I'll skip over that but there are two things to do before starting the reinstallation\n\n**1. Backup any important files**\n\nAs the windows install is suspect I'd strongly recommend NOT booting to Windows to backup the files as that runs the risk of allowing the infection to migrate with the backedup files. Instead I'd recommend you boot the machine using a Live Linux Disc that will then allow you to browse the hard drive and copy any files that you need to a USB stick\\external drive\\network location etc\n\nMany Linux distributions have live disc images that are free to download but I'd recommend using [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php) as the desktop is similar enough that a Windows user should be able to find their way around it without too many problems\n\nAssuming your Grandpa's computer isn't particularly old you should be ok using the 64-Bit Cinnamon version of Mint\n\nIf possible you should do the download and burning of the Linux disk on a seperate machine from the infected one to avoid any infections trying to interfere with the process in any way\n\nYou'll need to check the user manual of the infected computer to find out how to boot from the disk\\usb stick you create as different machines have different methods but often hitting F9 early in the boot sequence will bring up a boot menu that allows you to choose which device to boot from (if it's not been disabled)\n\nNote : Many (most?) live discs now also have the option of creating bootable USB sticks but personally I prefer to use DVD's which, whilst slower to use, are write once devices which prevents them from being modified if you accidentally boot using the infected Windows installation when the live disc is still in the drive\n\n**2. Check you have the installation keys for any software (inc the Operating System)**\n\nMany commerical software packages make use of activation keys that need to be typed in during the installation of the package. These keys can either be on printed labels (for retail\\boxed products) or be digitally supplied via emails\n\nKeeping track of activation keys can be a pain as boxes go missing, emails get deleted etc etc but there are tools available that can extract the keys from installed applications which can be very useful if you're not sure what's installed\n\nA package I've used in the past to recover keys is [Magical Jellybean's Keyfinder](https://www.magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/) the free version of which should be enough to recover the most commonly installed applications keys\n\nThe downside to using something like Keyfinder is that the Windows install on the machine needs to be working sufficiently for you to run the package which with an infected machine may not be an option\n\nIf the Windows installation isn't working succiiciently to use something like Keyfinder on it another option is to use a spare hard drive if you have one and do a sacrificial Windows install on it in order to then access the infected drive to do the key recovery but if you do do this then make sure you wipe the sacrificial drive afterwards as there's a chance its Windows install could get compromised when you access the infected drive\n\n*****\n\nFootnote thought\n\nDepending what your Grandpa uses the computer for there's always the option of dumping Windows entirely and putting Linux on the machine instead. As I've already said, the Linux Mint desktop is similar enough that a Windows user should be able to use it without too much trouble and the available packages are close  matches (or in some cases identical) to their Windows counter parts",

      "If there is no important data, wipe everything as suggested an fresh install Windows from a usb stick. With a new install, get antivirus first (avast for example).",
      "You can do the stuff others have recommended, but if your grandpa doesn\u2019t have anything important I would just wipe and reimage it. That is going to be the best way to remove whatever was put on it. Depending on the PC manufacturer, you may be able to create a bootable USB using their cloud recovery (if it\u2019s offered by the manufacturer). If not, you should be able to order it from the manufacturer for a discounted price. You could get the MS iso files, but  you could run into activation issues.",
      "The best option to ensure the computer is clean is to wipe and reinstall from a USB flash drive. What version of windows is he running? If you are unsure press the windows key and the R then in the run box that appears type winver",
      "I believe MalwareBytes have such a tool in addition to their standard anti-malware program, can't remember what it's called though. If you dig around their website, you should be able to download the installer as well as the most up-to-date known viruses list or whatever the right phrase is. Download them onto a USB stick using another computer.\n\nAs an aside, you do know about Safe Mode, do you? It's a Windows feature. Haven't heard of any malware faking Safe Mode, but for all I know it's possible.",
      "There is no software you can run that will make 100% sure he is not still infected. The tools others have mentioned are fine, however if someone had unfettered access there's no telling how badly he's been compromised, possibly in multiple ways. The only way to be 99.9% sure the machine is clean is to wipe it and reinstall. That .1% is the super malware that can survive a wipe/reinstall. That's mostly nation state stuff though, I doubt the Chinese government is attacking grandpa.\n\nBefore doing anything make sure you have backed up anything important: documents, pictures, etc.\n\nHow you reinstall depends on what he has. If it's a machine from a retail company like Dell, HP, etc. them there is certainly a recovery partition that holds a copy of the OS as it was when it left the factory.\n\nIf he has Windows 10 a clean version can be downloaded from Microsoft, installed and activated.\n\nOf course all his programs will have to be reinstalled also.\n\nIf you decide to go this route post again with all the details of his machine (brand, model, OS) and we can give guidance on how best to proceed.\n\nOnce this is resolved, whether by a reinstall or scan by an AV, I'd suggest taking an image of the PC and setting it aside. If this happened once it may happen again. If you have a [clean image](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/4241/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-7/), with all his programs, OS, files, you can just restore that."

I just force-close insta and reload and it's fixed. \n\nYour mother might be experiencing this same glitch. \n\nEdit; I'm sure your mother doesn't have a mental health issue.. geez, so many people immediately want to assume your mom is just hearing things and has mental health problems. A bit rediculous conclusion to jump to in my opinion. \n\nHonestly I'm pretty set on believing your mom is experiencing a glitch similar to what I've experienced. ",

Pay for a service to host the server for you, it's that simple. \n\nYou can change your routers MAC address which will force a new IP to you.

Although the system hasn't been touched in 2 years (when a tech installed the splitter to add her Phone modem)  I was just wondering how one house so many people. Thanks for all the responses.\n\n\n\nMy mom called and had the Time Warner Tech get on the phone with me because I wired her new addition.  This addition was wired 5 years ago.\n\nTwo techs came to my mom's house, and said that over 300 people were without cable/internet and that they had traced the signal to her house.  Nothing has changed at her house.  She has always had problems with her internet going out, but her cable tv would stay on.  The only thing that has changed since I wired it all 5 years ago is she changed to internet phone about 2 years ago.\n\nWhen she changed over tot he full Time warner package (Phone/internet/tv) the tech came out, and put a splitter under the desk and added the phone modem.\n\nThe tech got on the phone with me, I told him there were no hidden splitters under the house and the only splitter was under the desk that their guy had installed 2 years prior. He said ok and hung up on me.\n\nWhen I called my mom back, she said they said they had found the problem, that it was a splitter under the desk (?) (what?)\n\n\nShe said that her signal was affecting the whole neighborhood and that also it could affect phones in New York. (We live in South Carolina).\n\nThis all sounded a bit strange. I asked her was she sure it wasnt someone casing the joint.  My nephews said they were in a Time Warner van, and they had the clothes, so they must be legit.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea if something like this is possible.  Just out of the blue? Her cabling hasn't been touched in two years since they added a splitter to install the phone modem.\n\nAlso. I do want to add this, but it is totally unrelated. About a month ago, a Time warner guy came to my door. I opened and he just stood there. I finally said, can I help you.  He said yeah, you had an appointment? I said no. \nI asked him what address he was looking for? He didn't answer. He asked me what my address was. i told him and asked him again what address he was looking for, but he just said, \"I guess I have the wrong house.\" and left.\n\nOdd. The next day, I was leaving for work, and I noticed the cover of my cable box lying on the ground a few feet from the actual box.  I tried to put it back on, but the bolt thing was missing so the cover won't stay on now. I'm pretty sure that guy had to have messed with it. Anyway, thats no big deal.

      "**Software - Maintenance - Updates**\n\nComputer software should be kept as up-to-date as possible, as these updates will provide added security and, in some cases, extra functionality to your software.\n\nOperating systems are the most integral part of your system and should be kept up-to-date regularly. Your operating system will have a software update program that will allow you to easily update your software. In some cases, these programs will not only provide updates to the operating system, but updates to other programs as well.\n\nIt is important to keep your operating system up to date. If you choose to disable automatic updates, be sure to check at least once a day for any updates that may be available for your system.\n\nMost other pieces of software will have a software updater built-in to the software. You can check with the developer, who will be able to outline the update process for you.\n\nAnother piece of software that is important to keep up-to-date is your anti-virus software. The anti-virus software uses what are called definitions to find and actively protect you from threats. Most vendors will update their definition files on a daily basis, and it is important to keep these files up-to-date. If your definitions are not up-to-date, your computer will not be protected from the latest threats. Be sure to keep these definition files up-to-date for this reason. If you are unsure how to update your definitions, check with your anti-virus vendor, as they will be able to give you instructions on how to keep your anti-virus software secure and up-to-date.\n\nIn addition to keeping your software up-to-date through the software updater, it is also important to use a version of the software supported by the developer. If the developer is not actively supporting the software that you're using, this is just as dangerous as not using the most up-to-date software possible.  New security exploits may have been found that developers will not patch. For this reason, it is important to stay on a supported version of the software.",
      "Power Supplies Demystified\n------\n\n**A Guide to the Most Important Component in Your Computer**\n\n-----\n\n**Section 1: Why you should care about your power supply unit (PSU)**\n\nThe power supply unit (PSU) is the engine on which your entire computer system is based.  It is responsible for taking the high voltage mains power from your wall outlet and transforming it into the low voltage DC that your computer requires.  Without electricity, your computer would be useless, but the importance of quality power supplies are often overlooked by the end user.\n\nThe reason for this is simple:\n\n*When a power supply is doing its job then the user should never have to know it is there.*\n\nUnlike RAM, storage space, CPU cycles, etc, a power supply should operate transparently from the time it is installed until the time the computer becomes obsolete.  Unfortunately because of this transparent nature many users do not put much thought into their PSU, and thus problems ranging from intermittent errors to catastrophic cascading hardware failures resulting from inadequate or mediocre PSUs occur, and are often misdiagnosed.\n\nRemember - if your PSU is causing your problems, then swapping out other components during troubleshooting will not only be a waste of time, but you may end up with an even larger stack of dead parts as they get damaged by the faulty power unit.\n\n**Section 2: Common Misunderstandings Regarding Computer Power Supplies**\n\n1. Advertised wattage ratings are a good indicator of PSU capability and/or quality\n2. If a power supply is faulty or underpowered then the system will simply not power on and/or the problem will be obvious\n3. Power supplies with identical advertised specifications are equally good\n\n*Regarding misunderstanding #1:* \n\nIn order to understand why wattage is a poor indicator of actual PSU capability one must first learn a very important electrical rule called \"Joule's Law\".  Don't worry, it is easy.\n\nPower (watts) = Voltage * Amps\n\nThis means that wattage, which is the overall power, is directly proportional to voltage and current (amps).\n\nSince there are many interdependent components inside of computers which rely on different voltages to run, and require different amounts of power, then the power supply must be able to not only convert power from the wall outlet but also split this power into different voltage 'rails' of different power capability.   \n\nLet us create a make-believe and simplistic (ideal) power supply.  This supply has a 12V rail capable of 10A, a 5V rail capable of 5A, and a 3.3V rail capable of 1A.  We will ignore negative rails for simplicity. This gives us a total power capability of:\n\nP(watts) = (12V * 10A) + (5V * 5A) + (3.3V * 1A) \nP = 148.3watts \n\nHowever, this does not mean that all 148.3W are available to all components.  For instance, only 120W total is available on the 12V rail, and even if the other rails are barely utilized all of the 12V devices are limited to 120Watts total regardless of the total power capability of the unit.\n\nAnother key factor making wattage ratings misleading is that power output can be highly variable outside of ideal conditions.  Due to poor component choices, poor quality, and poor design, many power supplies become increasingly unable to output their 'rated' power once temperatures and/or loads start to rise.  Since increasing temperature results in lower ability to supply stable power to components, as well as increasing power requirements of the components themselves, it is easy to see how a 'high wattage' but poor quality PSU would result in instability and possibly hardware failures when a user attempts to run the supply at its rated power.\n\n*Regarding misunderstanding #2:* \n\nPower supply problems often lead to misdiagnosis during troubleshooting because they manifest themselves as errors in other components.\n\n*Regarding misunderstanding #3:*\n\nBuild quality, internal component quality, and design are the most important aspects of a good power supply.  It is much more important to get a reliable power supply than to get a bigger power supply.  \n\nMost power supply brands are simply repackaged units that have been sourced from a large manufacturer and cosmetically altered.  Thus, a different model PSU from the same brand may be made by a completely different manufacturer and be of entirely different quality than others by the same brand.  A google search for your make and model PSU and the letters 'OEM' will often reveal which manufacturer made the unit if it is a rebranded unit.\n\n**Section 3: I have a dodgy/suspicious PSU in my system.  Should I replace it if everything is currently working fine?** \n\nThat depends.  Answer the following questions:\n\n * If the computer becomes unreliable will it have a significant negative impact on your life?\n * Is the hardware in the computer non-expendable?\n * Do you feel that a relatively small investment now is worth it to help ensure trouble free operation of your system on a hardware level?\n\nIf you answered YES to any of the questions above, you should seriously consider pro-actively replacing your power supply.\n\n**Section 4: What are good desktop PSU models?**\n\n * http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-2547993/psu-tier-list.html\n",
      "-Example Comment- Note how relaxed it is, and reads like a rough outline of an essay. Anywhere between this and a full essay is fine.\n------\n**Hardware - Maintenance - Heatsinks** \n\nHeatsinks need to be cleaned periodically as they fill up with dust, dirt, and hair.\n\nFor desktops, a combination of canned air, alcohol-dipped cotton swabs, and (maybe) toothpicks is generally enough.\n\nFor laptops, there's generally youtube videos detailing the process for the majority of lines/models. Watch video thoroughly before beginning.\n\nNotes: \n\nMany users vacuum them, not knowing this generates static and can damage their computer. \n\nThey also may be tempted to remove the heatsink from the processor without knowing they will have to change the thermal paste.\n\nThe processor also has a tendency of pulling out with the heatsink. Depending on the line of processor, rocking/twisting it before fully removing may be required for safety.\n\n",
      "I put this guide together a few months ago for this subreddit and it got some positive feedback...feel free to use/tweak/modify as needed :)\n\n--Malware prevention and security hardening guide--\n\nThe best anti-virus is a combination of good security practices.   With over 100k new malware variants seen daily, no single AV solution will be the silver bullet that prevents you from getting malware.\n\nSo while AV software is good to have, I wouldn't put too much emphasis on it alone.   Microsoft's Security Essentials (or Defender in Windows 8 and above) does a decent enough job.  With AV you're usually looking at the detection and removal side of threats, with prevention only for known signatures or behaviors.   Where you want to be is more on the prevention side of the security spectrum..and you want to do it in such a way that it doesn't degrade performance (like all-in-one AV solutions tend to do).   So where do you begin on prevention?  Here are some tips to get started:\n\n- Reduce your main account's admin rights.   When malware kicks off it'll often run with the same privileges as the account you're logged under.  UAC can be defeated fairly easily so the best way around this is to simply operate as a standard user. (create a local admin account with a simple password, log into it, and convert your main account to a standard user).  From here if an application needs elevation, it will need to ask for admin credentials.  Done, you've just reduced the threat of rootkits tremendously.\n\n- Keep your PC up to date.  Since most malware depends on exploits to run, keeping your internet facing apps up to date is paramount.  Consider Secunia PSI to take care of patching the things Windows Updates cannot: http://www.secunia.com/psi\n\n- Use a site advisor.  These can come in handy to help steer you away from compromised sites...as well as prevent them from loading if redirected.  One I like to recommend is Web of Trust, although be sure with any site advisor to read the reasons why sites are flagged...as sometimes they can be incorrectly reported: http://www.mywot.com\n\n- Be wise with your browser.  Internet Explorer, while often picked on by fans of other browsers, is actually remarkably secure when used properly.  Make good use of the security zones by turning off Java and rarely used plugins for the standard \"internet zone\" and add sites you trust to the \"trusted zone.\" Chrome is also a fairly secure browser, with higher reports of vulnerabilities (CVEs) but a good track record on patching turnaround. (edit: further discussion in a sub thread below on browser comparisons).   Mozilla FireFox, with no plans to sandbox, needs a little extra care when using.  Highly recommend NoScript with FireFox.\n\n- Block malware behaviors.  Two really good hardening solutions are Microsoft's EMET and FoolishIT's Cryptoprevent.  EMET is a great malware mitigation toolkit when used properly, as it stops common malware exploit techniques rather than malware signatures.  Quite brilliantly actually as there are millions of malware in the wild, but only a handful of exploit behaviors. Cryptoprevent works in a different sense in that it blocks common exploit locations  if they happen to get past initial defenses (using Applocker rules): https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/jj653751 \nhttp://www.foolishit.com/vb6-projects/cryptoprevent/\n\n- Stay on top of what changes are occurring.  There are a variety of change monitors and HIPS solutions out there.  One I'm really fond of that is free is Winpatrol: http://www.winpatrol.com",
      "#**How to know if you need more RAM**\n\n*(I originally posted this here: https://slickdeals.net/f/4922990-how-to-know-if-you-need-more-ram?v=1).  I made a few edits below:*\n\nThere is a very simple & quick way of seeing if you actually are running low on RAM before over-buying or not seeing the results you were hoping to.  There's a misconception that adding RAM makes a machine faster - this is not true UNLESS the machine needs more RAM than is already installed.  Adding RAM to a machine that isn't already using it all does nothing whatsoever.\n\nSo first, use your computer! Fire it up and launch all of the apps that you generally have going. Open a few browser tabs, get your email going, etc. Try to do an average session - don't open every app on your machine. In the example below, this is my laptop that's running Outlook, IE with several tabs, Chrome with several tabs, Notepad, Windows Explorer, a couple of chat apps, Dropbox and Snag-It.  Then:\n\n - Launch Task Manager (ctrl-alt-del & then 'start task manager'; OR right click task bar at the bottom of your screen and 'start task manager')\n\n - Switch to the 'Performance' tab\nClick the 'Resource Monitor...' button at the bottom of the window, and [it will pop up a window that looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/BcNuu.jpg).\n\nThere are 5 different sections of memory usage on the bar graph, but only 3 of them are really important to you.\n\nThe first one (in grey) is hardware reserved - this is RAM that hardware uses & there's nothing you can do about this, so not important. This amount will generally be pretty low.  (A high amount of RAM here usually indicates that you've got more than 4GB in a 32-bit machine)\n\nThe third one (in orange) is 'Modified'. Also not very important because this amount is generally low, but this is RAM that's in use by low priority tasks that can be quickly released for other use.  \n\n**The second section** (in green) is important - this is the total amount of physical RAM that your machine is currently using (ignoring the swap file). In the graphic linked above, the machine is using 3GB of RAM.\n\n**The forth section** (in dark blue, labeled 'Standby') is also important.  This section is actually not labeled well, as this is your free or available RAM. This is memory that's available for use by whatever application needs it next. In this example, there's 3GB of RAM just waiting to be used.\n\nFinally, **the fifth section** (in light blue, labeled 'Free') - this one is also kind of misleading, as this is more like wasted RAM, not free RAM. The memory in this section is the amount that Windows is just ignoring because it has no use for it. It's not being used & it's not ready to be used by anything - it's just sitting there doing nothing.\n\nSo, if someone were to show me this display & ask if they need more RAM I'd say no, as a matter of fact you have more installed than the machine is using. In this example the machine is only actually using 3GB with another 3GB on standby, and 2GB doing nothing at all. As it's running now, having 4GB in the machine would be fine, and having 6GB would give it a safety buffer. It's got 8GB installed (see the line highlighted in yellow), so 2GB is 'wasted' because Windows simply has no use for it.  Adding more RAM to a machine like this would be nothing but a waste of money.",
      "**Cleaning your PC - A Pre-emptive strike against stability and heat related issues.**\n\nComputers, whether they are a desktop or laptop, produce heat. Thus why they have fans, and other cooling equipment.\nHowever, these fans push and pull air inside and out of the computer. This means that dust, hair, and even bugs can quickly accumulate within the pc.\n\nThis buildup of dirt inside a pc can quickly cause stability and heat related issues. The performance of the PC can even be affected by this as well.\n\n**What kind of issues?**\n\n* The dirt can cause the computer to overheat and shut off during high performance usage, due to the CPU reaching the maximum safe temperature for operation. (Tjunc/Thermal Failsafe).\n\n* The dirt can cause the PC to run at temperatures higher than normal, and can cause throttling related issues. (Where parts such as the CPU or GPU down clock/run slower, to not produce as much temperature).\n\n* Performance of the PC is lowered due to the parts inside running hotter than usual. (Throttling related).\n\n**What collects dirt:**\n\nCPU Heatsink and Fan, HDD bays, power supply, GPU, case fans, and pretty much everything else inside.\n\n**What you need:**\n\n* A Can of compressed air, or an air compressor.\n*  Screwdriver (If the PC does not have thumb-screws for the board, or if you wish to remove the GPU or other parts to clean them)\n\n\n**What to do to clean your desktop:**\n\n* Power off your pc, unplug it, and carry it to a well ventilated area.\n\n* Open the side panel of your PC. (Note: There may be screws involved. Use your screwdriver).\n\n* Use your can of compressed air to remove the dust off of the PC components. (Follow the usage instructions on the side of the can).\n\n * For the CPU heatsink and fan - Spray the air into the fan and heatsink a few times to remove the dust and dirt. Double check that it's clean after. If it's not, do it again.\n\n * For the GPU - Spray air into the cooling system of the GPU (fan, heatsink, in between the plastic case and the board). Double check that it's clean after. If it's not, do it again.\n\n * For the Power Supply - Spray air through the fan on it, and give it a thorough cleaning. Then do the same though the opening for it on the back of the case. Double check that it's clean after. If it's not, do it again.\n\n *  For case fans - Spray air through them, and clean the fans with a static-free cloth if it's really caked on. Double check that it's clean after. If it's not, do it again.\n\n *  For the HDD bays and other parts of the PC that collect dust and don't move air - Spray air into them, and get the dust out. As always, double check to see if it's clean.\n\n* Put the side panel back on the PC case.\n* Bring the PC back to your Computer area and reconnect it.\n* Enjoy your cooler and better performing PC.\n\n\n**What to do to clean your laptop:**\n\n* Power off your laptop, unplug it, and carry it to a well ventilated area.\n* Remove the bottom panels of the laptop (RAM, HDD, etc panels - you will need a screwdriver for this)\n* Use compressed air to remove dust out of those panels, and spray the air into the laptop fan and exhaust (where the heat comes out) port. \n* Double check if they are dust free.\n* Attach the panels again, carry it back to your computer area, plug it in.\n* Enjoy your cooler, and better performing laptop.\n\n**Always follow the usage instructions on the side of the compressed air can.**\n\n**Always be careful not to over-spin fans when blowing air into them. Try using shorter bursts of air to avoid this. Over-spinning them can cause damage to the fans internal construction.**",
      "**Home PC builders - Troubleshooting a PC that won't boot**\n\nSo you've carefully selected your parts, watched countless youtube videos, and have built/upgraded your PC, and it won't boot. Windows won't load, or maybe you get nothing at all on the screen. Assuming there is no fire, lets go through some troubleshooting steps. \n\n- Unplug EVERYTHING from the motherboard except the CPU, power supply cables, speaker connector (if speaker isn't onboard), power switch connector, and cpu fan connector. \n- Turn it on, you should get 1 beep that repeats about every 2 seconds. That means there is no memory installed. \n- If it doesn't turn on, unhook the power switch connector, and try touching the 2 power switch pins with a metal screwdriver for 1/2 a second. Yes, I've seen bad power switches. \n- Still won't turn on? verify that the brass stand-offs under the motherboard are installed only in places that have screw-holes. If you have a standoff just pressing against the back of the board, it can short things out. Check out the yellow arrows here: http://img.tomshardware.com/us/2006/12/14/how-to-build-a-pc-part-3/case-locations.jpg\n- Still nothing? You have a bad motherboard or power supply. There is a slight chance of a bad CPU, but unless you've damaged it during the installation, probably not. Try a power supply from a friend or perhaps an older PC.\n\nSo lets assume though that you did get that repeating beep. You're on the right track, lets continue.\n\n- Turn it off and Install the minimum amount of memory, check the manual if you're not sure. \n- Turn it on, you should get 1 long 3 short beeps. That means there is no video card. \n- Turn it off and Install the video card, make sure to connect the extra power connectors if needed. At this point you should also be verifying the power supply requirements for your video card, make sure the PS is large enough. Hook up a monitor. \n- Turn it on, you should get something on the display. Turn it off and Attach keyboard and mouse. \n- Turn it on again, go into the BIOS, reset it to defaults. Your BIOS might have optimized defaults and normal/safe defaults, or something similar, use the safe defaults. Attach HDD, and turn back on. \n- You should boot into windows (or not if your disk is new). You might need to go back into BIOS here and enable/disable AHCI, depending on how it was set when you installed your OS. Doesn't boot either way? replace HDD cable with a different one. Especially if you did a lot of cable management and bent up the cables or are clumsy. If you got this far, you're probably in good shape. Keep installing parts, pretty much one at a time.\n",
      "Software - Maintenance - General\n\nOperating systems, especially Windows, will get clogged up after a while. Regular maintenance is required\n\nFor computers with a Hard Disk Drive, you should defragment it at least once a month, even if Windows tells you it is not necessary. Because of the way Solid State Drives work, this is not necessary.\n\nAtleast once a month, do sfc /scannow in an elevated command prompt\n\nAtleast once a month, do chkdsk in an elevated command prompt\n\nUse a program like CCleaner at least once a month to clean out unnecessary files, and to fix registry issues\n\nAt a minimum of once a year, a user should check to make sure that they don't have unused programs on their computer using either CCleaner or Control Panel\n\nEvery user should have at the very least, an antivirus program. I like Norton Internet Security and Malwarebytes in tandem.\n\nAs a general rule, if you don't immediately recognize a website in google, don't click on it. You run the risk of getting viruses. Although if you have Norton Internet security, it will tell you before you click\n\nNotes:\n\nMany users never run any maintenance on their computer, resulting in slowing down, viruses, and stability issues.\n\nSometimes, Microsoft will release updates that break certain aspects of a computer. This is why it is important for an administrator to run sfc /scannow in an elevated command prompt\n\nA lot of users install programs without any prior research. Do not install programs unless it was recommended to you buy a trusted website, or you have done thorough research on the program to ensure that it does not contain viruses.\n\nAs a last note, software, whether it is on a Mac, Windows, Linux, or other OS, will inevitably slow down over time. This is why it is important to do regular maintenance. This prolongs the life of a computer tremendously.",
      "Building a System Dossier\n------\n**Know what's in your computer** \n\nOne habit I started years ago was keeping a file, or *dossier* on every computer I own.  This can be as simple as an actual file folder with hardcopy information, or a spreadsheet where you record everything.  I personally like hardcopy, as it's not dependent on access to a storage device or cloud service.\n\n**Hardware**\n\nMy application of choice for this is [Speccy](https://www.piriform.com/speccy).  It's a really neat little app that gives you a wealth of information about your system.  For example:\n\n* A summary that lists the basics such as OS, CPU (with processor family name, such as Haswell, Broadwell, etc), RAM, Motherboard, connected monitors, GPU(s), whether Crossfire/SLI is enabled or not, drives (with manufacturer, model numbers, capacities...), audio....\n* Detailed information on your OS, including installation date, UAC status, firewall status, Windows Update settings, and more\n* A listing of running processes and services\n* Detailed specs on memory modules, including manufacturer, part numbers, timings, speeds, voltages, etc.\n* ...and much, MUCH more.\n\nA listing like this is *extremely* valuable when it comes to troubleshooting issues, because many people are unsure of exactly what components they have.  \n\n**Software**\n\nFor this, I use [Belarc Advisor](http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html).  It does a similar job as Speccy does, but also does one very cool thing that Speccy doesn't.  Namely, it can pull a ***list of the license keys*** for all your installed software.  Guess what we see in here and in the live chat *over* and **over** and ***over*** again?  People that need to reinstall something but lost/threw away/forgot the license keys.\n\n**Additional Measures**\n\nIn addition to the reports generated by Speccy and Belarc Advisor, I keep any important information that comes with hardware/software that I purchase.  This information goes in the folder for that system.  Some examples:\n\n* Purchase receipt\n* Serial numbers\n* Manuals/installation guides/FAQs/etc.\n* Support information and length of manufacturer's warranty\n* Terms and conditions of any extended coverage/warranty/service plan associated with it\n\nSomething breaks in one of my systems, and I can go to the folder, get the relevant info, and either contact the manufacturer for service or the third-party company handling it.\n\nOne more thing.  Let's say your home/car/place of work is robbed/burglarized.  You'll need to file a police report, and you'll need to file a report with the insurance company (you do have renters/homeowners insurance, right?  If not, you should).  The police will want the serial numbers (to monitor pawn shops, etc), and the insurance company is going to want specifics on make, model, date of purchase, and purchase price (to determine what they will pay out in benefits).\n\nTrust me when I tell you that having this information makes such an experience much, *much* less painful than it would be otherwise.\n\n**Final Considerations**\n\nLike I said, I prefer hardcopy, but I also keep electronic records both onsite and offsite.  There's no such thing as too many backups.  Update the folders/spreadsheets/whatever when you get new hardware or update your OS or other licensed software.  Go back and read the reports every once in a while to have a better idea of where you stand.\n\nThis may seem like a lot of information to keep up with, and if you're new to doing it, it's going to take some effort.  But when shit hits the fan and you end up needing this information, you'll be very glad you did put int he work to make sure you have it ready.\n\n***TL;DR***, make sure you know what you have.  It may come in useful someday.\n",

      "Yes there are differences. I think they are in line with the versions of Quick Charge:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Charge",
      "Both have access to VCC bus power (there should be no difference), yes its normal to have less contacts in the 2.0 than the 3.0/3.1 and I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the poping noise",
      "There really isnt such a thing as USB2 to C, since USB-C is specifically a USB 3.1 protocol.\n\nUSB 2 runs over 4 pins, 2 for data (send/receive) and 2 for power (power/ground)\n\nUSB 3/3.1 runs over 9 pins, 2 pins for usb2 data (send/receive), 4 pins for usb3 data (2 send/2 receive) and 3 for power (1 power/2 ground)\n\nRegardless, both operate at 5V power, while USB2 can run at 500mA and USB3 at 900mA. Thus, USB3 will charge faster. Keep in mind though that when dealing with rechargable batteries, faster charging reduces the life of the battery faster than slower charging.\n\nAny cables that are 4 pin with a C type connector are strictly intended for charging, and although will allow data transfer, should not be relied upon.\n\nAs for the clicks, a C type connector does not have any clips (like micro USB does) so it should not make any noise whatsoever. My guess would be the USB2-C cable is looping back the extra 5 pins to trick the device into thinking its a USB3 cable, and the click/pop you hear is the loopback connection disconnecting. I guess it is really a matter of determining if it is an electronic click or a mechanical/physical click.",

      "The fact it's USB 2.0 and an adapter could be the problem. \n\nFirst of all, the standard is half duplex, meaning if the device is receiving data, it cannot be transmitting data. This introduces delay and is basically unusable in an online gaming scenario, because you need to be able to receiving the incoming video, and transmit your outgoing video, at the same time. If you can't,  hello lag. This could be why the download and upload speeds are high (this is speed, which is a different metric), but your experience is still terrible. It's packet delay/loss you're experiencing. USB 3.0 is full duplex, which will likely help.\n\nNone of the above will help if it's simply network congestion (which can also introduce quite a bit of delay, despite a high theoretical max dl/ul)\n\nIdeally, you would just use a PCI wifi antennae or something similar, and just skip the whole USB adapter thing all together. If you're swapping out for a USB 3.0 card anyway for that purpose....might as well just get the Wifi antennae instead. \n\nNote, technically Wifi is half duplex as well (per antennae), but the standards get around it with features like MUMIMO and having multiple antennas (hence why 'primo' access points have so many damn antennaes, and even basic access points have two).",
      "They can't. Gaming on wifi is a joke. The fact that most recent online games have found ways to mask lag doesn't mean it isn't there. Csgo doesn't utilize the tricks that recent games like both the divisions for example do to cover lag. Console gamers don't play csgo",

When I plugged my 7 month old PC into the powerbar connected to the cubicle power outlet, it shorted and fried virtually everything.\n\nWe did not have any other PC parts compatible with my build to test to see what was and wasn't fried from my PC so I ordered essentially an entire new computer with the plan on returning what still worked from my original PC.\n\nSince then I have had this issue where on boot, the system freezes on the motherboard's logo, and the wheel thing just stops spinning (sometimes with it saying \"preparing windows repair\", sometimes with it just being the spinning circle, sometimes \"preparing disk check\" etc.).\n\nI have had this same issue with two motherboards now, two CPUs & two PCUs. I have ran memcheck on the new RAM I bought and after four passes it gives no errors, both with each individually and them together (interestingly, memtest86 boots without issue, as does BIOS). I have tried different monitors & different wall outlets as well. I have tried to boot windows from two different drives, one was the SSD from my dead computer (which boots windows on my laptop without issue) and one was an empty disk drive where I installed the windows UEFI repair software from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10). I have tried both of these drives via SATA and via USB.\n\nThe only thing I can even remotely think of it being now (I'm really out of ideas for what to continue troubleshooting at this point), is that I did test my old RAM on both of the new motherboards I have tried (when i got the second new mobo I wasn't sure if it was the old mobo that was DOA) but it still seems unlikely that damaged RAM would permanently damage the motherboard into the issue I'm having (just an assumption however).

Many companies use a single local IP to host in a router (i.e [192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1) in ASUS's lineup) So a lot of devices across the network are hosting from the same IP which sometimes leads search engines like google to think all the traffic is from a single band. \n* Using multiple soft network devices in the same machine. Like if you use a VM, it often uses a dedicated host (with the same IPV6 and IPV4 protocol properties). So that're virtually two devices pinging at the same time but physically they are the same machine and at the endpoint, the very same IP. \n\nNow how I fixed this problem? \n\nWell, I didn't do anything, I simply waited for a day and apparently it automatically fixed itself.

It's almost creepy.\n\nI have a Macbook Pro from late 2016. It runs Windows. I don't use it for much more than simple things such as emails, watching YouTube live streams, and playing some games. \n\nA couple of days ago, I was starting to watch a stream from my favorite YouTuber, and I accidentally clicked an ad that popped up. What puzzled me though, was that I have an adblocker installed to my router. Its pie hole. and, on my browser. double protection. so I thought anyway. The ad redirected me to several links when it finally stopped on a website that was pure black. I got sick of it and just restarted chrome. But after closing chrome, before I could re open it something caught my eye. There was a blank file chilling on my desktop. It was called \"KB1\". The icon was a blank file icon, like when you lose a custom ICO or something. It was 15 MB in size. The extension? .File... What kind of extension is that.\n\nAnyway, I deleted it and went about my day. Later on, I went to send an email to my uncle about helping him activate a copy of windows. But I was somehow terrified at my email client. I was trying to send him a picture of the activation key, (cause he wants proof it's not stolen) idk. And when I did, to my terror, in the explorer selection view, my sidebar, my files, everything was \"KB1.file\".

    "post": "This is probably one of the more wacky requests you may see on this sub, but I see a lot of people more intelligent than I that could possibly at the very least offer me some direction. It should be noted that 'novice or beginner' is generous assessment of my tech knowledge and abilities. \n\nI\u2019m currently living/volunteering at a children\u2019s home and outreach mission in Mexico, where internet is available but not incredible performance wise. I have recently been put in charge of our computer system, which was basically built from scratch by a 'computer genius', or at least someone considerably more skilled than I, who had to leave suddenly, leaving behind a very confusing and messy system. This system was built together as donations and things became available. I believe the mentality was for lack of a better analogy: rather than untie the shoe and tie it correctly, they just kept adding knots as needed, and now we have a very impossible knot to untie. \n\nOver our decently sized property, we have connection coming from at least 7 seperate internet lines that come in, that I can tell. These lines are sent into nearly 30 switches over the property, with at least 10 different subnets serving different areas. I think...  \n\nThe lines that come in are then filtered through a Cisco smart switch and into some old work stations serving as routers (which are running Ubuntu... again, i think), back into switches that go through the property. Almost all of our equipment has been in use for probably a decade, and being donated this equipment was likely significantly used before it arrived here. Our whole system seems to have been 'Frankenstein'ed' together, which makes googling solutions near impossible. \n\nAll of our smart switches are Cisco made from 2005 or earlier. Each have not had relative updates since 2010 and are no longer supported for the company. I don't think what we have has a much longer shelf life. Things are running in incredibly dusty environments on Windows machines, routers made of old work stations, Linux and Ubuntu and variety of things that are far above my knowledge. It appears that if one of the switches goes down, everything goes down.  \n\nThe former position holder had loosely documented the layout of all of these switches. I do have this loosely documented map that is attached [here](https://imgur.com/a/XOTJCWU), which shows the general routes of our cable, but I can already confirm that this is not fully accurate. We can see where lines go in the ground, sometimes we can see where they come out, often times not. I could spend pages trying to explain what I think I'm looking at but probably would not describe accurately all that that is here. All of our phone/internet lines to my knowledge enter in at what is labeled 17. \n\nCurrently, if you look at the photo, something between the 6 switch and the 1 switch has gone bad (no connection siting invalid IP configuration for Ethernet connection-I've tried every Google answer in the book), leaving the entire right side with no access. This is another one of those 'we see where the cable starts, but not where it ends' problems. So I think rather than fix what is broken I would rather build over the mess that is the current system of aging, undocumented, exposed in many spots, and weather worn cable going in and out of the ground in various places. I'm sure this would all be horrifying to many of you. It's horrifying to me and I don't even know what I'm looking at half the time. \n\nGoing forward, I would love to have the mentality of starting from scratch like we have nothing set up yet. We have the ability to spend some dollars, within reason (in the $1,000 to $10,000 range, potentially more, ideally less) to update our current internet system and simplify it considerably. Also we no longer have to worry about the buildings across the field taking up the left half of the photo, so we just need to serve the main cluster of buildings on the right. \n\nConsidering the layout, what is the best way to supply internet to the property. What would you think is the best route to go? Like I have stated I would really like to update and simplify, but I have no idea where to start. I want to make this as user friendly and as organized as possible. If that means limiting switches, subnets, wireless over cable, you name it, I'm on board. Now that we have been blessed with a decent budget we can actually look at current/modern solutions rather than try to work with outdated/donated equipment. \n\nI feel like I've said a lot and I am still positive I have left out some vital information that would be helpful so if you need to know more, please ask and I'll do my best to answer as I can. I hope I have been somewhat clear. Like I said before, I am truly over my head when it comes to this kind of stuff, so any help and guidance is appreciated. I know this is a big question, but I could use as much help as I can get.  \n\nEDIT: Sounds like getting a network diagram setup for the sub here is the first in a plan of many attacks.   \nAlso will be looking into Ubiquity as that seems to offer a level of simplicity that would be good going forward.   \n\nEDIT 2:I may have gotten lucky. Found more documentation in what I have. This was labeled as the [logical map](https://imgur.com/a/oerdu3w) and seems to document the general routes and models of the switches. [This as well](https://imgur.com/YqWH1xu) which loosely seems to cover what each switches VLAN ports are set to. This is likely not completely accurate but close.

Dedicated routers or wireless routers, modems, windows/linux/ubuntu machines, and etc. Just to know specifically what can be reused and what should be ignored, discarded, or reformatted into a central access terminal for users\n\nWith this starting point, I think we can build out a simpler network for you guys",

As others have said a network diagram is the best place to start. It'll allow us to identify weak points as well as give us a glimpse into what kind of load you are experiencing.

That being said, I cannot recommend Ubiquiti enough. The products are priced at what you'd expect, they work, and they're dead simple to use/manage.\n\nI'd start by making that very clear that everything needs to go, it's beyond a security risk. Get everything from a single vendor that will integrate together, again Ubiquiti, Meraki, etc... While Meraki is great, something tells me it won't be budget friendly.\n\nI'm not really sure of your leverage, but with that $1,000-$10,000 replace your core, and then show donors/investors and see if they'll help the cause.

It limited all wireless devices to 6 mbps while the wired devices got around 60 mbps.  \n\nI would suggest that you attempt to log into the management webpage and look for some configurations about QoS or WiFi speed. To access you're router's configuration page you need to first know the IP address. Go to your wired computer. If you're using Windows you can open cmd or powershell and type in the command `ipconfig` and if you're on macOS or Linux open terminal and type in the command `ifconfig` . Find the Ethernet address for what's called your \"default gateway\" (that's your router) and type it into any web browser.

Maybe check your ISP contract small print to see what minimum speeds they have guaranteed and if it isn\u2019t running at the specified minimum then they have to send out a tech to fix it for you. \n\nGood luck.",

With special tools it is possible to see what was written before what was re-written, but this isn't a software you can download for free.  \n  \nAt most, this may cost $2000.

It ran DOS.\n\nA later model was the 80286.  This was also 16-bit CPU, with a few extra features and the ability to work with more RAM.  It was a separate type of CPU than the 8088, but booted up in a mode compatible with the 8088.  It still ran DOS.\n\nThen, the 80386.  Intel's first 32-bit CPU.  The 80386 had all the full mechanisms necessary to properly run a modern, secure multitasking operating system with two \"levels\" - a \"kernel\" or system mode and a \"user\" or normal program mode.  Normal programs cannot mess with the system mode (blocked by hardware) unless system mode allows it.  This is everything Windows NT and derivatives (like XP, Vista, 7, etc.), or Linux, or BSD, or any modern operating system needs.\n\nIt booted up in a mode compatible with 8088 still, so it could still run DOS.\n\nEverything since the 386 built on the 386.  So that's why `i386` has become a general name for \"32-bit Intel CPU\" - the implication is that it's compatible with the i386 or later.  The first time I heard `i386` was in connection with Debian Linux (which dates back to 1993?) but the earliest versions of Windows NT 4.0 worked on multiple architectures (like MIPS), and I386 was used there to refer to stuff that would run on Intel CPUs as well.\n\nWhen 64-bit came around, Intel wanted to do things a different way, with its new Itanium chip.  This was called IA-64.  Some Intel documentation refers to 32-bit Intel stuff as IA-32 as a result (that could actually probably go back further than when the Itanium came out, though).  \n\nThe Itanium flopped, and AMD decided to extend the i386 architecture into a 64-bit version, rather than break off and make a new architecture like Intel tried.  Debian Linux called this `amd64` - not sure if that came from something previously, or if everyone started doing that when Debian did that.  Intel's name for this was EM64T.  But most Windows stuff, since Vista at least, uses `x64` to refer to that.  I don't know who at WIndows decided chose that but it stuck in a lot of Windows documentation.  Intel hasn't used the x86 nomenclature to refer to CPUs since possibly the Pentium and definitely not since the Core line.\n\nSo - i386 / IA-32 / x86 = 32bit, and EM64T / amd64 / x64 = 64bit, and IA-64 = Itanium, which you won't see in a desktop system (well, there ARE desktop systems with this CPU it turns out).\n\nInterestingly the 64-bit CPUs still boot up in the original 8088 mode for compatibility, just in case you want to run DOS on your 8-core 3.0GHz new CPU with enough on-die cache to dwarf many systems of the early to mid 80's.\n\n(Intel also had been making CPUs long before the 8088, like the 8086, the 8080 - an 8-bit CPU, and their first single-chip CPU, the 4004 - a 4-bit CPU)\n\nEDIT: Corrections per Syde80, hunterkll and UncleTogie\n",
      "x32 is something else entirely actually. Its 64-bit code with 32-bit pointers. Its not actually popular, and only some linux distros support it.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI",

And despite the similarity to IA-32, IA-64 is not a name for 64-bit x86 but the name of the Intel Itanium architecture.",

      "/u/TheEmoEmu has it right. Also data doctors are usually very expensive and cannot guarantee results. They are the ones who're able if they think they can salvage some more. The more you alter the drive yourself (so any action you do with it that writes data to the drive) will possibly damage the pics some more, so try resisting the temptation of \"I'll try this program too\". Recuva recovered what an amateur can do, the rest is for data doctors with specialized stuff.\n\nAs hard and painful as this lesson may be, it only emphasizes 1 thing: There are two kinds of data:\n\n* Data that's replaceable, can be lost or is at most a bit annoying when it gets deleted or is lost\n\n* data that is backed up somewhere else. \n\nThere's no place for valuable data that's not backed up. A backup can be 'in the cloud', or it can be on an external harddrive. It's still not a 100% guarantee that you'll never ever lose it, but even a single backup increases your chances of not losing your data tremendously. For certainty there's the '3-2-1' rule of backups: Have at least 3 different copies, in 2 different formats of which at least 1 is off-site.",

      "http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tech_support_cheat_sheet.png\n\nI've been in various positions of tech support for about 15 years now, and I generally enjoy fixing other people's computer problems. If it's the sort of thing you enjoy doing, then by all means, be the go-to fixit guy.\n\nI really think that there are some things you should be aware of, though.\n\nFirst and foremost, fixing someone's computer is a really good way to end up married to that computer.  By that I mean that there are some people who, if you touch their computer once, not only will you be asked to fix any and everything that goes wrong from now until the end of time, you are also likely to be blamed for anything that goes wrong, too.  You might think that you're just replacing a bad video card, but from their point of view, you are working black magick, and wielding forbidden knowledge not meant for mortals.  So six months from now when their hard drive suddenly goes bad, or they end up with a boatload of spyware, it will somehow be your fault.  \"IT WAS FINE UNTIL YOU WORKED ON IT.\"\n\nSecond, you're not always going to know right away what the problem is.  You have to do basic troubleshooting, and a lot of that involves trial-and-error.  A machine that powers on but won't POST could have one of several common problems, or any combination of problems.  Sometimes the only thing you can realistically do is swap out components with known-good replacements until the problem is gone.  If you don't have a vast supply of test parts lying around (and unless you do this for a living, you probably don't).  This means that you're either going to have to tell the person that you don't know how to fix their problem (nearly always the safest choice, but if you're like me it will make you feel guilty), or you will take a dangerous guess and tell them they need to buy a new ______.  Due to Murphy's Law, that will always, always, always be the wrong part. Then you will look stupid and feel guilty.  Rinse and repeat until the problem is solved.\n\nThird, some people think that because you successfully fixed the expensive computer they thought was totally broken and unfixable, destined for the landfill (all it needed was the HD reformatted and the OS reinstalled) then surely you must also know how to fix every single other device that uses electricity in any conceivable way.  TVs, microwave ovens, DVD players, vacuum cleaners, cars, copiers, MRI machines, whatever.  They will call you asking for help. When you tell them you can't help, they will assume you're feigning ignorance and blowing them off, because you're an asshole. You're Superman. Why wouldn't Superman help Lois Laine when she needs help? The only reason would be because he's an asshole.\n\nAnd of course, all of the above only applies to the people closest to you.",

      "\u201cCertified\u201d is just a word. It all depends on who put it there. Retailer certified? They reset the OS and maybe wiped it down with a cleaning wipe. Manufacturer recertified? They probably ran a quick diagnostic, repaired any obvious flaws, reset the OS and wiped it down. \n\nThere are two concerns I have when looking at recertified laptops. \n\n1- warranty. Sometimes the reason for return was a subtle flaw that will not show up immediately. Make sure there is some sort of refund/repair/replace warranty on it. \n\n2- battery. While laptop batteries have advanced a LOT in the past years, I still expect them to have an 18-24 month lifespan. If the model you\u2019re looking at is over a year old, ask if that was replaced during certification, if it\u2019s covered under warranty (often it\u2019s only covered for a very short time, if at all) and how much a replacement battery will cost. (Not all batteries are easily replaceable)",

The Manufacturer, for ease of use of the customer, either swapped or upgraded the customer to a different notebook.\n\nUpon inspection the issue found was either A) User Error or B) Easily fixed with a replacement component.\n\nI find Refurbished products actually hold up better than new - while the warranty is slightly shorter, the product has already been repaired once.  Meaning the part that failed was removed, so the life is extended. \n\nThis doesn't mean nothing can go wrong, this holds true for any laptop, but the warranty reduction is really where the price discount comes in.\n\nit's usually only 90 days if you want most stores to offer a warranty extension program of some kind: These really aren't a scam for laptops as repair can be pricey down the road.",

I became really paranoid that she was talking shit about me to her friends, and then it kinda just became a habit.

I did all of this without ever touching her phone.\n\nEventually, this came to bite me in the ass when I read messages between her and her new boyfriend, and I saw/read things that I wish I could bore out of my memory. I can pinpoint the very day when I started getting relationship PTSD type episodes, which for a while caused me to physically punch my head over and over because I couldn't deal with what I saw. It was an unfortunate cocktail of anger and depression. \n\nAlong with the advice to wipe your phone, I would recommend changing passwords on social media and your email. Seems like a pain in the ass, but as someone on the asshole end of this story, if you think he's monitoring your phone he is probably already in your social media accounts with your password. \n\nI sincerely hope this isn't happening to you, mistrust is an absolute poison in a marriage, and mine fell apart because of doing things like this.

    "post": "Edit 2: UPDATE\n\nOkay, so, I got in touch with Microsoft again (I typed microsoft.ca into the address bar, just like the first time; stop insisting I clicked a bad link, guys); but first, I'd like to thank everyone for your input. It was especially useful to recieve confirmation that the script did exactly what I thought it did. The revelation that \"Microsoft support\" was actually a bunch of outsourced contractors working to meet unrealistic metrics was also particularily enlightening. Heck, I even appreciate those of you who kept insisting that I got scammed -- you were only looking out for me.\n\nNow, story time. It's pretty boring though; nothing much happened, but I figured you'd want some closure. So, I went to their support chat again (triple-checking the address since you guys made me super paranoid), typed in a brief summary of what happened yesterday and got connected to a tech who gave me pretty much the exact same script as yesterday. After confirming my product ID and that I had a valid Win7 key, he also asked to remote in. At this point, I realized that he'd completely ignored the fact that the last tech I got in touch with activated my OS illegally and refused to let him remote in until I spoke to his supervisor. I got a call a few minutes later; spoke to a nice lady with what sounded like (at the risk of sounding racist) a mild Indian accent and managed to convey that the last tech did something illegal but I had no tracking number or name. She assured me that she would still investigate but she could have been blowing me off for all I know. Whatever. Not my problem anymore; Microsoft can clean up their own house. They bounced me back to support chat and insisted on remoting in again. This time, I let him do his thing and he simply ran winver then entered a new key via slui 3 -- nothing shady. Typed out the key for me to save in notepad, gave a session ID and ended the chat. As far as I'm concerned, problem solved.\n\nTo everyone who kept saying I fucked up and got scammed, I totally see why you'd think that but I'm confident that I went through official channels and got screwed by an unscrupulous tech trying to improve his metrics. I mean, come on, give me some credit here. I noticed that the batch file was doing some shady stuff, even though he only flashed it on screen for the seconds necessary to copy and paste then save the file, and had the presence of mind to investigate. You really think I wouldn't have noticed if he'd tried to install malware on my machine? As to everyone saying that remoting in is highly irregular, I'm 2 for 2 now with techs insisting on remoting in. Either I got scammed both times by scammers who neither took any useful information nor compromised my machine while providing me with a new Win10 key, or they changed their standard operating procedure. I think the latter is more likely. I'll grant you that not recieving an email after the first session was unusual, but the guy already pirated Windows for me; seems he's not a stickler for protocol. Since the confirmation email I got after today's session was titled \"Microsof Answer Desk\", I'm pretty sure the confirmation email is not a fully automated process. And before anyone starts to insist I got scammed today as well, the email came from a css.one.microsoft.com account. I know emails can be spoofed but the headers look fine to me in my non-expert opinion. All in all, I remain confident that I've not been compromised. Please stop saying I have unless you actually have something new to add to the conversation; you're boring me.\n\nOnce again, thank you everyone for your help. Tech support is not a fun job; doing it for free seems nigh on insane and I greatly appreciate you taking time out of your day to help a total stranger. Keep being awesome =D\n\n*****\n\nOriginal post follows:\n\nSo, I replaced my motherboard and had to go to Microsoft support for activation of my Win10 install (upgraded from Win7 that was in turn upgraded from XP). Went with the online chat option and after providing some information, the tech remoted in to run a batch file that magically activated Windows, deleted said script, then used Windows Search to make sure the script was deleted.\n\nI found this curious and managed to recover the file. After a tiny bit of googling, I found that the batch file was a script to activate via KMS that hits the same host (AlwaysSmile.uk.to) as a file distributed among pirates. In fact, there's a short [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/4qyr81/i_have_seen_this_activate_windows_all_version_and/) dealing with said script.\n\nSo, my question is, has anyone experienced something similar? Is this standard operating procedure? I'm fairly sure that I don't actually have a legitimate Windows key now and, as I understand it, KMS activation has to hit the server every 180 days. I don't really want to be reliant on hitting a server in China every 6 months.\n\nI should probably contact Microsoft again, shouldn't I? The problem is, I didn't take down the support chat session id because I figured that there was no point since the problem was solved. So, yeah, hope someone more knowledgeable can let me know if I'm overreacting or not.\n\nEdit: forgot to add link",

What you should do however, is to remove the current KMS activation, and try to get another tech to generate a new key for you.

The risk is that someone could drive by your home, and determine your SSID even when you are not there.  This is a low risk.\n * In the hidden SSID case, your home router will say nothing, but your computer will constantly broadcast \"HomeWifi, where are you?\".  This means that wherever your computer is, an attacker could potentially notice the attempts to connect to HomeWifi, set up a rogue AP called \"HomeWifi\", and get your computer to connect.\n\nNote that in either case, when you are present at home, an attacker can see your SSID with no effort.  However, the hidden SSID scenario opens you up even when you are not at home; when you are at starbucks, you are now vulnerable as well.\n\nI shouldnt have to rehash this, its well known and has been for ages.

      "A classic 2G network is very simple. It's just FM modulation - the same principle radios work on. However, if you need multiple users to be able to communicate simultaneously, it'll need an additional concept called multiple access - specifically Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) where each user is alloted a specific and unique radio frequency \"band\". This is to prevent the overlap of communication and cross talk. However if you're aiming at a simple one - to - one communication link, the simplest such implementation is the walky - talky: the tech can be found on a variety of DIY sites (with a bit of technical knowledge). It's other features of networks like Caller IDs, SMS and data that make a network establishment complicated.\n\nEdit & P.S : Older phones usually won't support the internet as they wouldn't have anything to work on packet data (which is what the internet is, data broken into smaller packets and then transmitted). Older phones were completely analog based and didn't have bursty / packet like nature as it's main purpose was to support voice communication, which was completely analog without any amount of digital data processing. As for slightly modern phones that do support the internet, getting it to operate on a local wifi like network maybe hard as the frequency bands are different.",

      "So there are two ways that a DDoS can disrupt traffic.\n\nThe one that everyone knows about is by just throwing so much traffic down your connection that you run out of bandwidth and stuff starts to get queued and gaming goes to shit.\n\nA great way to prevent this is to set up a firewall rule such that it drops all the traffic coming from offending addresses, or an even more extreme configuration would be to whitelist just the hosts you want to connect to and black list everything else.  If you have this configured far enough up the connection, it'll effectively prevent any traffic from getting to your computer since it will be stopped at the router.  This won't work as well as you might think though for two reasons.  The obvious one is that the traffic is still getting to your router, which means it's still getting to your modem which means it's still going to clog your pipes.  The more subtle reason though is that it makes your router busy, and this is kind of important for understanding DDoS attacks not just on an individual, but on businesses and services as well.\n\nA Router is just a computer.  If you give a router too much shit to do, it'll slow down.  Once you actually get to commercial grade routers, the major concern a network engineer has in purchasing is, 'how much shit am I asking my router to do'.  A major difference between this [mid-grade sonicwall](http://www.sonicwall.com/us/en/products/NSA-2600.html) and [this hundred thousand dollar monstrosity](http://www.sonicwall.com/us/en/products/SuperMassive-E10000.html) is the CPU and Memory.  When you throw traffic at a router, it has to sort through it and direct that traffic to a location, or decide to drop or do something else with it.  If you throw enough traffic at it, the router won't be able to keep up and the end result is the exact same is a brute force attack that just clogs the pipes:  Traffic is put into a queue and gaming goes to shit.\n\nNot a lot of this applies to you directly, but it's important to understand what's happening so you can assess solutions effectively.\n\nIn your case, you are kind of fucked.\n\nIndividuals don't have a lot of bandwidth and definitely don't have the power to control what's coming into their network before it's too late.  The suggestion of talking to cloudflare might be your best bet.  Other than that, you might do well to buy a static IP that is on a totally different subnet in hopes to dodge your attackers.\n\nA final note:  99% of the time someone thinks they are being DDoS'd, they are not.  No one dedicates the resources to just drop the connect of some rando.  You are an exception since you are a personality and this is literally the first time someone said, 'I'm being DDoS'd!' and believed it.  That said, it's still probably worth it to scrutinize your traffic going in and out to remove external variables.\n\nAlso, note to absolutely everyone ever who might ever be concerned about IP address privacy:  Stop using Skype.

      "I've been fixing computers and servers for almost 8 years now. Your battery is dead. They're only meant to last about a year in most laptops, especially older ones.\n\nThe reason it says \"Plugged in but not charging\" is because current is passing though it, but it can't recharge because the chemicals inside are inert. If you let it rest for a few days you'll find that you may be able to charge it to 1-2%, at which point it'll shortly die and then go back to this state. It will randomly say it's charging, but this is a mis-read by the OS. \n\nYou'll need to purchase a new battery for the laptop if you want to fix this problem, but if it's 8 years old I find it unlikely you will find one. ",
      "This is most likely due to the fact that its battery needs to be replaced.",
      "Well first test is to try taking battery out entirely and see if you can power the laptop back on with just the charger plugged in.

Thankfully I usually already have a spare charger and laptop so it's pretty easy to suss out which piece of the puzzle is broken.",

I had an issue like this on an older Dell, tried a known good charger and the issue was resolved. That's why it's called troubleshooting and not troubleshot.",
      "My computer has this issue but it still works as long as I keep it plugged in. What would happen if I just kept using it like that?",
      "A common misunderstanding is that the message of \"battery not charging\" means that it was accepting the charge previously.  Unfortunately, not the case.  Many laptop systems are forced to prioritize processes to allow them to not lock up completely.  This means that lower priority items won't run until the higher priority ones are complete and cpu cycles are available to run other lower priority tasks.  Batt status is one such task.  Laptop batts are good generally for a max 4 years at the time of your laptop production (now it's rare for a battery to be good more than 2 years on a really good day (depending on how often it was taken off wall power.)  \n\nat 8 years it's safe to say the battery is well past it's life, you can look at a shop like batteries plus who specializes in batteries for varied devices and commonly has a standardized core to go into a housing to allow a laptop or other device the ability to connect to the battery once inserted.  If you contact toshiba they will tell you it's \"no longer supported\" because they want to sell a new unit.  Don't waste time trying to buy a used battery off of amazon or ebay as they are going to have the same issue as your current laptop.  Buy a good battery or play wall hugger, but just be aware that the wall hugger means you have to think of it as a desktop and as soon as the plug comes out of the wall everything on your screen is lost.  (I learned more than once by experience)  In the end I just setup a desk with the laptop plugged into a ups so that I wouldn't try to just walk away with it like i was used to doing. \n\nMost of the batteries in laptops since 2010 have been LiIon batteries which have a maximum number of cycles and once exhausted they are a nice paperweight and nothing more.  No way to bring them back from the other side.  NiMH or NiCd batteries may end up with a cell stuck open or closed and a full discharge may cause them to reset.  Lead Acid (common to in UPS batt backups & Golf Carts) have a thing called \"battery memory\" which makes it beneficial to periodically run the battery down almost dead and then full recharge.  The chemical elements in the battery respond as if getting a workout and after a few cycles of doing this keep this charging capacity as a norm.  Likewise if you use it was a very short time (like 20%) and then recharge it.... then a lead acid battery will consider the 20% the maximum charging capacity.   It's why you may see a UPS saying it's going through a battery maintenance cycle, in reality it's trying to stretch the usable charging capacity.   ",

      "Read what /u/HostileApostle420 said. 18650 is very common. Lithium Ion prefers shallow cycles. I think it was nickel cadmium that liked the full discharge cycles (due to cycle depth memory). We don't use those old batteries anymore and you should charge to full whenever you can. Of course, if I'm wrong, he'll correct me :)",
      "It depends on the battery/device. A fair percentage of lithium batteries are 18650s. 18650s on their own are very resilient and long life batteries. (most laptops use these). \nA laptop charge circuit bypasses the battery when it's charged as the input power is just used 2 run it.  \n\n\n\nPhone battery wear is more down to the high drain nature that phones sometimes require.\nIts an idea to turn off any fast charge modes if you leave it on charge overnight. Slower charging is better for longevity. \n\nI have 6x 18650 batteries  (for vaping and for a stupidly powerful led torch) these have outlived 2 phones. I charge these with a smart charger designed for 18650s and it completely stops charging at 4.19v.   \n\nA cr2032 button cell in a watch, or in a motherboard will probably outlive the motherboard.   \n\n\nTL:DR I wouldn't worry about it too much. Modern lithium batteries will probably outlast the device it is powering. ",
      "Very short answer, yes they all affect it, but nowhere near as much as it used to. The recharging effect on battery life isn't worth worrying too much about these days.",
      "Draining and charging a battery will eventually reduce its capacity and/or cause it to fail completely.\n\nFully depleting a battery will generally cause it to 'wear out' faster than charging from ~50%, but the actual effect is hard to quantify, and varies by battery chemistry, quality, etc.\n\nLeaving it charging overnight may or may not have a significant impact, depending on the behavior of the device doing the charging. Some chargers cut off charging current entirely at 100% and don't turn it back on until a lower percentage is reached, some switch to 'trickle' charging at 100% to maintain the charge, and some periodically alternate between full charging current and nothing. That last case is likely to cause a battery to wear more quickly, but it's also pretty uncommon in modern devices, so in general, you shouldn't worry about leaving it charging overnight.",
      "lithium batteries are affected primarily by heat followed by cycles but not in a meaningful way (i.e. small percent lost after 1000+ cycles, if you charge 1-2 times a day then that's a few years for negligible loss). High heat is much worse for the battery and happens frequently esp in electronics where there's a high drain (lots of heat), and in poorly cooled/heat generating devices like smartphones and laptops, where cpu temps reach 60-80C and hot air is getting blown around everywhere.\n\nOther batteries have different limitations. NiCad batteries have memory, where if you partially discharge it, then charge it again, the battery \"forgets\" how much was full charge and stops charging instead of going all the way.\n\nLead Acid batteries in cars generally only have 200-300 cycles, which is affected by charging all the time, but in general, you want your car to start and a battery replacement is just something you have to deal with. \n\n ",
      "This reminded me of this video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF1hGT4z4y0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF1hGT4z4y0)\n\nit claims that for lithium batteries it is best to keep them plugged in as much as possible and not let them get very low on charge but what's even more important is that the temperature isn't very hot.  Don't put them in a freezer\\(it will ruin them\\), just a cool place if it's really hot\n\nJust make sure it is lithium batteries as other types of batteries may be different.",
      "With modern, LI batteries:\n\nkeep the temperatures low, try to keep between 20-80% charged at all times (don't be afraid to top off before heading out) and if you can avoid charging overnight. ",
      "I'm going to say that unless the charging system has a really good \"fuel gauge\" system, then frequently charging a battery is going to overcharge it and shorten its life.  \n \nA fuel gauge is a system that keeps track of the amount of energy that goes into the battery from the charger and out of the battery to power the device.  But I don't think fuel gauges can measure the energy highly accurately, at least not for charging.  \n\nWhen a modern charger system without a fuel gauge is started, it does a quick check of the battery and then if everything seems OK it feeds energy to the battery at full blast.  It constantly monitors the battery voltage and maybe also its temperature and will throttle down or even shut off completely when the voltage or temperature goes too high or changes too fast.  However it takes at least a few minutes for the battery voltage or temperature to rise enough for the charger to detect the state of charge, so if you frequently use the battery just a little and recharge it, those first few minutes of full blast charging may cause enough damage to matter.  On the other hand if you use the battery quite a bit before charging or, in the case of a laptop computer leave the charger plugged into the computer and AC outlet all the time, you shouldn't have to worry about overcharging.  \n \nLithium chargers shut down 100% when full charge is detected because lithiums can't withstand any overcharging at all, not even trickle charging, and can easily be damaged or even become dangerous.  On the other hand nicad and NiMHs handle overcharging better, and many of their chargers won't shut down 100% but will continue with a trickle charge.  However trickle charging those batteries for too long will cause metal wires to grow inside and short them out, so don't leave such batteries in the charger constantly.  \n\nIt's not a good idea to fully deplete any kind of battery.  NiMHs and nicads aren't supposed to go below about 1.1 volts per cell but can recover.  However lithiums must never be allowed to go too low, and this is so important for them and your safety that the device or the lithium battery may contain protective circuitry to shut off the current if that happens.  Here's an example of what's inside a Ryobi 18V lithium battery:  [ToolBoyWorld photo](http://toolboyworld.com/eBay/Misc/P102_opened_right.jpg).  Notice the rather elaborate circuit board above the lithium cells themselves.  So if you have a lithium battery, charge it up every 3 months, even if you don't use it.  ",
      "Something related to this, I got a Ticwatch E recently and at first the battery life was shit, until I tried letting it go through several 100-0 charge cycles as I saw online. I thought that was odd as I've never seen that advise for any other devices.",
      "Depends on the voltage the controller deems charged and depleted but for the science google is a better help than me. But for most stuff consider the 20-60% the sweet-spot. 10-70% is more than acceptable. Avoid going over 80% except for emergencies. Charging overnight is a nono except again, for emergencies as it keeps pumping and depleting energy at high stress voltages for the battery.\n\nComplex batteries with a lot of cells are even funkier to deal with. The controller usually takes care of things, but cells don't charge and discharge at the same rate so sometimes a \"full\" discharge is useful to not overburden some cellls.\n\nGetting lithium batteries to \"0%\" is a nono too. Below a certain voltage the battery won't charge anymore but the battery controller on regular devices shouldn't let that happen anyway and will say it's discharged well above any risk of damage."

      "I worked under a sub-contract with a big security software company for a year and was trained as a malware removal specialist. Here were some of the steps we used:\n\n1. turn off system restore\n2. show hidden files\n3. clean temp, %temp%, prefetch, temporary internet files for all users\n4. uninstall all security, adware, and otherwise suspicious programs using add/remove utility\n5. manually remove those programs that will not uninstall\n5. manually check startup list in msconfig, and root directory, program files, windows, system32, and drivers for bad .dat, .exe, and .sys files\n6. manually check hklm and hkcu for bad registry keys and entries\n7. reboot to safemode w/networking\n8. d/l/install your favorite security software, set to early \"early load\" and reboot to normal mode\n\nAt this point if the problem was a simple trojan and/or adware the computer should be fixed. However, if there are persistent browser redirects, a polymorhphic re-injector trojan and/or a rootkit in the kernal, then more sophisticated methods must be used. For example, bad CLSIDs may be hidden in many parts of the registry and need to be removed manually. Often, we would have to deal with altered system permissions and corrupted system files. Also, we learned to use DOS tools such as \"copycon\" and \"calcs\" at the DOS prompt, and a number of registry tricks such as \"pendingfilerename\" to resolve issues. \n\nUltimately, the best solution may be to wipe all memory on the system clean and re-install the operating system, as the time and labor involved with removing the worst malicious software can be prohibitive. \n\nNorton, Avira, Avast and Kaspersky programs should all be equally effective in step#8 but all are best employed as preventative programs. Gmer, HijackThis, Autoruns, Malwarebytes and ComboFix can fix systems, but if used by an inexperienced person are just as likely to damage system files and force a reformat. \n\nOf course, the knowledge required to deal with malware evolves rapidly and my methods and information are over a year old and thus may no longer be effective.

BleepingComputer hosts a log reader for HijackThis, and there is also [HijackThis.de](http://HijackThis.de). Post your log into one of those websites and see what they recommend removing.\n\nAfter running the above programs, if the machine still seems to be running slow or showing signs of infections I will go through and run Combofix and/or MalwareBytes a second time (you'd be surprised how often I find more infections doing this).

If internet still isn't working I go into device manager and uninstall the network adapter drivers (make sure you have new drivers ready to reinstall with if Windows doesn't have any to auto-install). Sometimes the network adapter drivers can be compromised/blocked by infections. \n\nAfterwards, install Windows Updates, update antivirus software (if its out of date I uninstall it and recommend installing Microsoft Security Essentials (free) or Eset NOD32 if you want the best paid AV). I also immunize with Spybot to protect against future infections (protects you from 175,000+ problems/infections).\n\nCouple of things to note. I have had bad luck with \"virus removal tools\". They tend to either not work in Safe Mode, not work at all, fail to detect/remove anything, or only target certain viruses which isn't a help when most infections these days are malware. \n\nAlso I think its really important to mention in the first post that you should only have on antivirus program installed. Having two AV's installed can cause a lot of problems/conflicts and actually make you less secure. \n\nAnother important thing is I recommend NOT using a flash drive when cleaning up an infected computer. [Some of the most major infections going around right now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker#Operation) target flash drives to help spread the infection. Burn all the mentioned programs to a CD or put them on an SD card with a write protection switch. ",

I was in the car running late for one yesterday and decided to try and record the conversation on my phone rather than using speakerphone and a recording device as usual. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHAT a mistake. In haste, I googled a call recording app, installed it, tested it out with a five-second call to a friend to make sure it worked, played it back, and proceeded to do two interviews.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfterward, I tried to access these recordings to download them. The app, which is called \"Call Recorder iCall\" would not let me open them and kept crashing every time I tried. There is virtually no customer support presence on the app or anywhere online. The developer info on the app store leads you to this useless landing page ([appitate.biz](https://appitate.biz)) with only a random contact form.

    "post": "An acquaintance of mine has a house in upstate NY and asked for help to get usable internet at his place. Currently he has satellite internet from Hughesnet and it sucks, can't even watch a Youtube video. Latency is even worse, averaging 400ms to 8.8.8.8.\nPics of property from Google Earth  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/sztDGTo.jpg  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/gy69oqu.jpg\n\nThe house was built in 1800's and is about 0.37 miles (540 meters) away from the road. On the road there are TW/Spectrum lines but obviously they won't run the drop all the way to the house for free. Last we checked they wanted $20k to run the cable. There are electrical poles going to the house but they're owned by the electrical company, I don't know if you can do 'easement' on electrical poles? Digging a ditch is out of the question, the soil is very rocky and there are even some granite boulders on the way. Also the driveway runs through neighbors property so can't throw a cable directly, it would need to follow the driveway.\n\nI've looked at wireless point to point stuff from Ubiquiti but there's no direct LOS because of the hill and tall pine trees on the way. 900Mhz might work but really not sure, I've never done such link before.\n\nAlso the elephant in the room - power. There's no power where the driveways starts by the road. Few months ago when I've researched this for first time I found some solutions like pole-mounted solar panel with battery providing 24/7 12/24V power supply but again, I've never dealt with it and we'd have to install a pole to actually get some sun in this forest.\n\nAfter talking with spectrum they will just leave a COAX cable at the pole.\n\nQuestions:  \n- COAX max cable run is 1640 feet, house is ~1900 feet away. Hypothetically what would happen if we run a cable this long? It just won't work or there will be a lot of noise on the line and modem would sync at lower speeds? Shit, if we get 10mbps we'd be happy.\n\n- Fiber technically will work for this distance, any recommendations for the cable? Can I just get some reinforced cable and throw it one the ground along the driveway? Also the converters and what do you do about the actual fiber, I don't have the equipment to terminate it.\n\n- Your solutions?",

      "You could almost certainly find a cabling contractor or an electrician that does a lot of data cabling to do this for way less than Spectrum. Electrician should be able to get you power at the road too. My preference here would be to have a weatherproof box at the road with power inside, run the coax in to a media converter that converts to fiber. Run the fiber on the electrical poles (electrician should be able to figure out if you need permission or whatever) to the house and convert back to coax to your modem. Make sure to leave some extra fiber at each end for future use.\n\nShould also mention that a contractor that does cabling specifically will be way better for this, especially if you're doing a fiber run. Nothing against electricians, just that data cabling is not typically their forte.",
      "Don\u2019t forget summer heat and winter cold will take a toll on the cable and box. ",
      "you can attach to the poles, you might have to pay a fee but it can be done. you could use coax with something like [g.hn](https://g.hn) but that doesn't really make any sense just use fiber. you can also get the power company to install a transformer and meter at the pole for a fee of course.",
      "Did a project like this a few years ago. An tall tree, few high power solar panels, charge controller with inverter, ground rod and line and a modest nema enclosure on an AC pad. Put the wireless bridge on the tree, used garden hose sections with heavy gauge wire to secure it. Bolt the enclosed to the pad, use solar panels on the roof, like a small dog house. Put the controller, modem and PoE injector and batteries at the base. Wire to the bridge.",

There is definitely some options better than nothing if all else fails/is too expensive.   \nVerizon Prepaid offers a $65/month plan for unlimited hotspot on a jetpack.

AT&T has fixed wireless for certain rural addresses. Unfortunately it's capped at 160gb (Somewhere around there), but the overages are modest at $0.20 per gigabyte. AT&T's is somewhere between $40 and $60 if I can recall.  \nT-Mobile has a hotspot addon which is $50 a month on top of a regular phone plan, which lets you use the hotspot function on a cell phone, 'unlimited'. (Albeit, with unenforced restrictions)",
      "Fiber is probably the best option for a run that long, but you\u2019re gonna need converters at each end. Coax can run a long ways but you might need a booster somewhere. Same with Ethernet. \n\nYour best bet is to contact someone who does professional cabling and get them to do it. You need someone familiar with running connections between different building and whatnot. I would not recommend trying to do some kind of wireless mesh or something. You need a solid hard line from the pole to the house. ",
      "If the poles are on YOUR property, you might have an inherent right to use them.\n\nYou'd probably have to have a licensed qualified technician to attach the cable to them.",

You'd want to run a conduit (that orange stuff that looks like pool  hose) and then pull the fiber inside that.\n\nAny solution will require power \"at the road\" not only to power the conversion equipment, but also because the ISP's modem will need to be powered.

From what I can see components wise, 650w should be fine, but you're going with an 80+ bronze unit that isn't exactly the best - invest in a good quality 80+ gold modular unit, and if need be recalculate every component and make sure that 650w is enough (it never hurts to go over everything to know for certain that you're achieving the overhead you need for your system to function efficiently). The PSU is such a vital component, its worth that little bit of additional investment to make sure that you get a good quality product that can not only supply your machines power needs, but also have adequate parts inside of the unit, so that you can have peace of mind in knowing that its not going to fail and fry your hardware."

I then booted up cinebench R15, did some tests, the CPU appeared to be running ok. The next day I boot the thing up again, try playing some light gaming, csgo, the thing runs horribly, even at minimum settings,which was seriously concerning seeing as how this was supposed to be an upgrade, and before i upgraded my cpu it was running smoothly at 60fps. So I look in CPUID and low and behold my CPU is reading 105 degrees! I've never seen a CPU that hot.\n\nI naturally immediately turn the machine off. Then leave it to cool.\n\nI turn it back on and... it doesn't even post. The fans turn on, yes, but no BIOS screen, no nothing.\n\nSo I think, hey maybe the CPU just died, so I pull out my old I5 2500, and install that a fresh. Still doesn't boot, again, no beeps, no BIOS screen no nothing.\n\nI also notice that when swapping CPUs, despite, well having only just tried to boot with the other one, it was HOT to the touch, after having only run for well, 3 seconds. \n\nNow, another thing to mention, the last time I had this issue with this same PC btw, it was the PSU that had blew, as in no bootup at all even with fans spinning.\n\nI tried the usual solution, changing cables, reseating the RAM, reseating other stuff. But it didn't work.\n\nPlease help, I've already wasted a whole bunch of my money on this PC I saved up from work and if my family finds out this thing broke they'll forever look down on me because of it seeing it as a waste of money.

Also, remove the cmos battery for 5 minutes and then try to use only 1 stick of memory and the onboard graphics. See if it works like that. \n\nFor you to damage a board, the cpu would need to hit more than 150\u00baC for some days so that the capacitors near the cpu would fail.

The connection issue appears to occur only on one PC at a time, but will happen 100% consistently on that PC until the router is restarted.\n\nSo far we've played CS:GO, Overwatch, and Black Ops 4. The latter two disconnect completely (although party chat is UNINTERRUPTED(?!?!?)), the former threatens to disconnect, but reconnects after a few moments. \n\nThe issue occurs exactly 5 minutes after connecting to a match. We've checked with several timers. I checked the log on the router and saw that it listed several instances of \"[DoS attack: RST Scan]\" from several IP's, one of which was a known Blizzard IP. I thought maybe the router decided that 5 minutes of high network activity qualified as a DoS attack, so I disabled DoS Protection temporarily, but the problem persisted.\n\nWe've tried many many things. We've assigned Static IP's to computers, forwarded ports, and so on. We haven't directly connected to the modem since it only affects one PC on the network, which to me implies the router is at fault. Of course I'm willing to try that if someone suggests that I do. What frustrates me is that 5 minute number. None of the usual fixes (such as port forwarding) would appear to make sense with something that happens exactly 5 minutes in. It strikes me as though some sort of software event on the router is blocking traffic, which is why the DoS attack thing seemed likely to me. I cannot, however, find any other settings on the router that would imply such \"protection\".\n\nOur ping in games is usually fantastic, and the problem only affects one computer at a time. I'm very confused. \n\nThanks to anyone for reading this!\n\n**UPDATE EDIT:** I fixed the problem, but I never figured out what was wrong. I replaced the firmware with OpenWRT and am very pleased with it. The problem erased itself (at least partially confirming my suspicion that it was software) but beyond that I have no additional information. It's extremely disappointing given that it was the most interesting tech-support issue I've ever had. \n\nAs I said in a reply below - I really was hoping to have a final answer. I'm super disappointed that I had to use the nuclear option here. I appreciate the incredible amount of high-quality responses. Thanks you guys! <3",

      "Make sure UPNP is enabled, disable any \"attack\" protection other than firewall, make sure DHCP lease time is at least 1440 ~~seconds~~ minutes, and make sure secondary router is in bridge mode. The only other thing I can think of is if there's some ping issue and you're being booted off of the server after 5 minutes of high ping. Reducing the number of hops your computer makes to the final modem will reduce latency significantly so if you can wire in to the main router that would be ideal. Otherwise make sure the secondary router is wired to the main router for the bridged setup, otherwise you'll introduce a crazy amount of lag repeating that signal from the secondary modem.",

(you fail one <76% and you have a good chance of not passing the course). We take tests through a website that the school partners with. The school updated their policy last year that test scores will no longer be released right away (for some random ass reasons). So sometimes we wait until the afternoon or up to 7 days before we find out what we scored. This also can lead to not knowing if your studying is working because you might be taking the next test by the time you find your score.\n\n\nHere's an example of what the results page looks like after you have taken a test if the results are hidden.

This could be blocked if you took away admin privileges from his account.\n\n\u200b\n\nI myself would take a simpler solution. Block access to the internet on his electronics for a while and monitor what he does afterwards. You can block access by changing the wifi password to something only you know, and changing the router access key to something only you know. Only way around this is to reset the router to default, which is easily done with a needle. Also disconnecting any Ethernet cables for his PC. If I caught him resetting it my next step would be the breaker box, cutting electricity to his bedroom, and confiscating smartphone, laptops, and tablets. If he needs a phone get him a flip phone that does nothing but call and text.\n\n\u200b\n\nHere is some other food for thought:  The laws of the NET Act split the federal crimes of online copyright infringement into two levels. Firstly, the commercial value of the downloaded or uploaded content must be of at least $1,000; this level of copyright infringement is punishable with a fine of up to $100,000 and one year in prison. A second, more sever level of federal crime is committed when at least ten copies of copyrighted material are copied over a 180 day period. The person responsible for distributing the material must make a profit of at least $2,500. At this level the individual can be punished with a fine of $250,000 and up to five years in jail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>[http://www.aaronkellylaw.com/list-of-piracy-laws-in-the-united-states/](http://www.aaronkellylaw.com/list-of-piracy-laws-in-the-united-states/)\n\n\u200b\n\nIts not likely he will end up with the 2nd part. But the first part does not require the user to sell or distribute the content, just download. It also stands to reason that if he downloaded multiple items under $1,000 USD that belongs to the same company, publisher, or whatever that totals $1,000 or more it would still be treated the same.\n\n\u200b\n\nBasically put, even if you are not distributing the product you can still be prosecuted and imprisoned for it.

Next, I will create an Allow firewall rule for every device (or range) that need access. You will have the option to specify ip addresses, along with ports, time, dates, etc. Just enter his ip address here and specify the ports 80,443. Remember, everything will not have Internet access by default (if you set your rules up that way), so you need to be explicit with your rules. If you want an ip to have full access to all ports, leave the ports section blank. You should also enable return traffic, so you may need to check some boxes that say Allow Established, Related, or New traffic. That's pretty much the gist of it without going overboard in my explanation. Feel free to PM me if you need more help.\n\nEdit:  Honestly, after re-reading my comment, this may be to advanced to attempt without some research beforehand. A more easier solution would be to make his login account on his pc a user account instead of administrator account.

      "Hi everyone, I solve the issue to specifically thanks to a few of the details that the following users gave me: /u/SnappyCrunch and /u/Degru\n\nI'll write down my process in case anyone finds this thread and has the same problem as i did:\n\nRe-summary: SSD would only appear in BIOS and no-where else within WINDOWS or WINDOWS installation, which caused some confusion when i was reformatting to install my system on the SSD.\n\nUltimately after realizing it was my last resort, with my only USB i deleted the Windows Installation media, and to the suggestion of /u/SnappyCrunch I went to [LinuxLive USB Creator](http://www.linuxliveusb.com/) and used the software to download \"Ubuntu 15.04 'Vivid Ververt' (GNOME)\" - using a laptop in the process - onto a live usb format. Following this i inserted the usb back into the machine i was previously trying to install windows onto and launched into the LIVE-OS (try Ubuntu from usb) and started the application [Gparted](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gparted/) and followed /u/SnappyCrunch advice below:\n\n>Once you've created the USB drive and started your computer from it, click on \"Activities\" in the upper left, then type \"gparted\" in the search box. Start GParted, then see if your SSD is listed in the dropdown box of available disks in the upper right of Gparted. If it's there, then select it, create a partition on it, format it as fat32, apply that, \n\nOnce that had worked out, I redownloaded the Windows installation media onto my usb (at this point i really wished i had 2 usbs) which took its time, once ready i launched back into windows installation and finally my SSD shows up as a 250GB active disk, which had a partition on it, i found this strange because surely if it had a partition it should show up right? Well apparently i think this is what had caused the issue in the first place a [corrupted](http://i.imgur.com/eJkEeVi.jpg) partition? Anyway being ecstatic that it was finally showing up i went back into my command prompt to make sure it was real (Shift + F10, diskpart -> list disk) and when i confirmed it was infact for shizzle, i went back to this beautiful thread and began following /u/Degru and his well descirbed sequence...\n\n>Boot installer disk, press shift-f10, type the following. In the third step, replace X with the number of the drive in the previous step.\n\n    diskpart\n    list disk \n    select disk X \n    clean\n    create partition primary\n    format fs=ntfs quick\n    exit\n    exit\n\n>This should format the drive and create a new partition. If it still doesn't show up in the installer, try rebooting the installation media. Once it shows up in the installation media, then just delete the partition you created and tell it to install in the unallocated space.\n\nBy god its finally [working](http://i.imgur.com/PbzAmh9.jpg)!\n\nafter that was completed i was able to comfortably select my SSD as an installation location et VOILA!\n\nI would again like to thank everyone for their help!",

The problem I'd that having a different physx processor from the master card being used to run the game can cause performance issues, varying by game of course. In the handful of people who have tried with setups like mine and similar (I get it, the 550 is weak. That's intended, I have various uses for it) a single card almost always won out vs a dedicated physx card. Might want to do a bit more research before you jump ship to an EMG setup!",

To me, anyway. :D\n\nIf they're just using it as a facebook/email/word processing/youtube machine, and that's all working well (even if it's working sub-optimally) then -- you're effectively creating a problem to fix, in the eyes of your girlfriend's parents. \n\nI think that's an important distinction to make here - you're wading in and foisting this action on them and their computer when it's good enough for them, and they may not want that - and you've gotta be cognizant of that when it won't improve their quality of life in a significant enough fashion without potentially introducing more problems.",

      "Office 2007 is officially broken (especially Outlook) after Windows 10 version 1803.  They could use LibreOffice or OpenOffice for free and those work well, now you know that Office '07 is utterly screwed after Win10 gets to \\~6 months ago updated.\n\nOtherwise, yes, It's worth it to fresh reinstall 64 bit- and that is the only option- it's impossible to \"upgrade\" from 32 to 64.  It's gotta be wiped and reinstalled.\n\nThat or just upgrade it to an SSD, get them running smooth for a while, and have them buy something newer when the time comes.",

I recently moved into a new apartment, and have noticed that touching my computers or network devices in certain places on their metal casing gives a little bit of a shock. It doesn't feel like a static shock, and it isn't painful, but feels like a vibrating buzz. Like touching an electric fence but less.\n\nI have everything connected to three prong outlets and the networking stuff is plugged into a UPS, which I thought might help but hasn't.\n\nThe things that shock me are:\n\n* My desktop (custom): outside seems OK, but I brushed against my SSD and was shocked\n* My wife's desktop (custom): touching the side\n* EdgeRouter Lite: shocks when I touch the top\n* EdgeSwitch Lite: same, shocks on top\n* Synology NAS: when touching the back\n* Dell Latitude Laptop: shocks when plugged in and resting on my lap\n\nAre these shocks dangerous to me or my stuff? Is there anything I can do to stop it, or will I just have to live with it?\n\nEdit: Hey guys, I talked to the landlord today and told him what I found. He said that he had an electrician look at some grounding issues in the other unit, but wasn't aware of any in this one, but he would send the guy back out to take a look. I doubt the guy would have kicked me out for telling him about it now, and I do know my rights, but I always have a tendency to assume the worst in these kinds of situations.",

Is it still a problem? if so, it's probably not in your equipment, it's somewhere else in the building. \nIf not then the first thing you plugged in that gave you a shock was the problem. \n\nIf you have a volt meter touch one lead to the case of something that was giving you a shock and the other to a nearby metal faucet or water pipe, or the outside ring of a cable TV connector. These are all grounded by a different path. If there is a voltage differential there is a short somewhere. Ground to ground should be 0V. ",

You may like stroking it to \\[insert fetish\\] and think its hot, but do you want your family and the whole world to know?\n\nIts the same thing with the IRS scams. Random people call folks and say \"We're the IRS, you owe us money because you didn't pay taxes on unreported income\". Most people at this point can think in there minds a few times where they thought they were smarter then the IRS and start to panic. And when threatened with either jail time or physical contact, its amazing what people will do. \n\nIf you are foolish enough to ever get hooked by any scam, and start giving them money - Via email/internet contact, it could go on forever. You will never be sure that they didn't destroy the evidence they have against you. Via phone, they'll keep you tied up so you cant verify anything, and wont stop until they've milked as much money out of you as they can and then they disappear. This isn't a golden rule though - there are an infinite amount of cons and scams, with an infinite amount of variations of those.

After I change passwords and whatnot, there is typically a period of time where they don't get in. This has been going on for about a year. It's a constant battle between them and myself. \n\nWhat can I do to keep them out for good? Should I get the police involved? What could they even do if I did?",

And the first line of defense is eliminating anything happening to *you* that might compromise your judgement or perception of the situation.",
      "Have you tried, murder?!   Or just talk to them and tell the chuckle fucks to cut it out?  Ask if they can hack a fist out of their asshole?",
      "I'd take this back to basics.\n\n1. Shut down wireless and disable/disconnect the router from the internet.\n2. Backup your data on a removable drive and consider this suspect until you can get a good scan of it to ensure that nothing is wrong with the data/infected.\n3. Take the router to another house/friends house and power it on, do not connect it to the internet.\n4. Use a clean computer to download the latest firmware for the router, perform a hard reset of the router. Using a computer that has not been on your network install updated firmware for router and setup from scratch for wireless. Disable WPS entirely, use WPA2 encryption, ensure the built-in firewall is enabled. I am sure someone else can give you more details if you provide the model of the router.\n5. Call your ISP and ask that they reset the modem from their end and see if they can provide you with a newly leased IP address. Most home stuff does not have static IP's but a lot of providers keep the external IP they provide leased to you for a certain amount of time, asking for an update may help get you off the list of whoever is playing not nice with you. This is also a great time to tell the ISP that someone has been using your internet connection illegally. This is more of a CYA if these idiots happen to lead anyone back to you by doing something illegal on the net.\n\nWhen you get home plug the router back in and leave your devices off. Hook it back up to the modem and get it running on the internet. Let it sit for a day or two, check the logs periodically for anything that looks funny, check your bandwidth and traffic. While this is going on wipe your home computer or laptop entirely, set it up as new. If you need drivers grab them with a USB from your friends house from step 3. Once the computer is ok and if the router is not showing weird traffic. Hook that computer back up to the router and see what happens. If things continue to be good as others have mentioned check your other devices, reset them one at a time before connecting them.\n\nJust to be clear though, under no circumstances should you reuse an old password for these devices. Use the most complex password you can think of. As you add devices to your network again be sure that they are secure with strong passwords and they are updated to the latest firmware whenever necessary.\n\nThis is a lot of work, and frankly it won't be perfect even doing all of this. I am sure someone with more security experience can chime in with more ideas.

Semi-portable (move it from location to location throughout the day (sit at place to use it for a while, move, sit, move, etc))?  Or are you out all day?\n\nIf you're in the same location, I'd say just take the battery out unless it needs to be charged.  No need to use the battery, why have it plugged in (it will lower the battery's ability to hold a charge over time)?  \n\nMoving from place to place every now and then w/ access to outlets, just use the battery when moving (unless the battery isn't charged fully and you know you need it later).\n\nBut if you're out and don't know when you're going to be able to get your next charge, charge it when you need it (even if you're at, say, 60%, and you're not sure when your next charge is, and could be a while from now, charge it).  If you have a somewhat set schedule, figure out how you can charge the least.  What I do is I have my laptop, charge it overnight to 100%, use it, then when I get to a certain point in the day, I know I have to charge it (or at least should because the ~hour and a half I have w/o a chance to charge will take the rest of the battery's charge).  Get to another point in the day and know I have a chance to charge and move.\n\nAnd TBH, if you're worried about your battery getting worse holding a charge over time, don't (though you should check availability of batteries for your laptop).  I own a Thinkpad T410 (~2010-2012) and the batteries that are $150 from Lenovo (the ones with 2x the batteries in it) are $20 from eBay.  Super quick shipping, too.

    "bestcomment": [
      "Hey OP, as someone who went through 4 HDDs on his old laptop, I know what this is. No virus, no full disc, no tool will help. Disc is dying. Your disc runs at 100% because there's corrupt sections and it's trying to read them and failing over and over. Sometimes it'll be a program, say you have a PDF somewhere and that section of the disc is corrupted and you tried to open it, force closing Adobe Reader through the task manager will bring your disc back to normal speeds, sometimes you just have to restart if it's an actual OS service that's executing on the corrupted section of the disc.\n\nYour disc will eventually corrupt the import OS files and your computer will not boot, when this starts happening frequently (more than once every 50 hours of use on the disc), it's not a matter of if but when. Outside of that, it's not a big deal if it happens very rarely.\n\nI suggest to backup your whole system ASAP (if you still can, some backup tools will deny backups of discs with lots of corruptions and backing up discs with lots of corruption doesn't really help much anyway). \n\nJust because your disc might corrupt the OS files it doesn't mean the disc is done for good. If you manage to backup without issues, when your system fails to boot, simply restore the backup and you'll run again without issues (until eventually more of the disc corrupts and it hits the OS files again). You should consider disable any sort of OS updates if possible as that increases the risk of damaging system files (in case the new files end up on a corrupted section of the disc and it all breaks).\n\nYou don't have to worry *too* much about losing documents, photos, other transferable stuff on your disc, it's unlikely it'll crap for good just like that. Every single time my HDDs failed and I couldn't boot the system, I used a USB with a portable boot setup and I could retrieve all those files without issues, like I said, maybe some of those will be corrupted along the way but if your system doesn't boot then it means it's the OS files that have issues and not the whole disc.\n\nGood luck.",

We have also \"disabled\" it in Task Manager, but it keeps popping up with Microsoft Edge.\n\nThe big problem we are running into is that the Chromium's location file (chrome.exe) keeps regenerating. I haven't been able to find anything about that so far. One YouTube video talked about a program you should delete that is a malicious regenerator (I think it was called GamesLog), however we couldn't find that in our files. No matter what we do, no matter how closely we follow all of these instructions, the program just keeps regenerating. I was hoping you guys could help me out and I would visit my grandmother again tomorrow with any insight you may have. ",

You will be blamed in some way for it or it will not look good. Looking after a badly thought out system is a poisoned chalice and unless they agree to invest in it either by hiring a consultant or implementing the recommendations then suggest you will not assist.\n\nI know it's probably not as easy as that and as it's one of your first jobs you will be keen but it's a disaster waiting to happen, good luck!",
      "First of all, what everyone else said: don't even think about being 'Office IT Guy' without sitting down with the business owner and going through the risks and responsibilities at the very least.\n\nEvery small business grows to this point, but few of them are prepared to make the investments required to grow beyond this point.  That's understandable; it's hard to see this happening while you're growing, and the costs to make everything right at this point won't be in anyone's budget.\n\nBut they need to be.\n\nIf you're really concerned about the hard drives in the \"server\", install a copy of [Acronis Drive Monitor](http://www.acronis.com/en-us/homecomputing/download/drive-monitor/) or similar - it will at least tell you if the drives are in imminent danger of failing.  It's not foolproof, though - disks can still fail without warning.\n\nUltimately, my advice would be something like this:\n\n* Backup everything.  Now.\n* warn your employer that the network as it stands is not fit for purpose\n* explain that you are not an IT professional, and that engaging the services of an IT professional will cost money, and that his or her recommendations will also cost money.\n* research local IT firms and what they would charge for a consultation visit - perhaps you can ask around locally; who would other local businesses recommend?\n* If you do end up doing the IT Guy job in spite of everything, ask for a budget, and a raise.  Not that you'll get either, but it's worth trying.\n* If by some miracle you do get a budget, use it to hire a professional, then go back to the job you were hired to do.",

These three things alone would be beyond your experience level by the sounds of it.  \n\nFor right now though I suggest you go to your superiors and tell them they need to get a full backup to an external drive immediately and they need to consult with an IT professional about their current setup because it's on the verge of collapsing.

If you had, they would (should) have hired someone that knew what they were doing that could have prevented the issue. \n\nDon't get roped into performing open-heart surgery just because you've played the Operation board game before. ",
      "What they're asking you to do is something you should be making about 70k a year to manage alone (well, from about 50k to 80k or so depending on where you're at)... I would advise you tell them to hire someone or contact a Managed Service Provider to come in.\n\nIf you want a brief rundown of how most small businesses operate. You want:\n\nP2P is a bit vague in this sense. They should have a domain, and everything should be shared through a server joined to it, that is controlled by a server functioning as a domain controller (DC). Then you should have a file-server, which is pretty much just for storing and sharing things, and an administrator should manage who has permissions to what, because you don't want everyone to be able to touch everything. So, to summarize: Domain Controller Stores user information and directing communication between devices internally, so that you can control who has access to the shares on the file-server, and how much they can access.\n\nThere's a lot to IT infrastructure, but the basics are you have your internet provider's router, connected to a firewall, connected to your servers/workstations through a switch. So that's at least three pieces of dedicated hardware on your end. Servers, Switch, Firewall. As stated, router is usually provided by ISP, but not always. I assume you have one already, since your office functions.\n\nYou can put all server roles on one server, there are versions of windows specially designed for it, called an SBS (Small Business Server), that can have domain controller, file-share, and if needed exchange (email) roles. \n\nNone of which should be managed by someone who isn't willing to be liable for grinding their business to a halt.\n\nEdit: Forgot an important bit, redundancy. You want backups of that \"server\" at the very least, through that won't protect you from people saving things on their own computers that shouldn't be there. If you absolutely can't do backups for some reason, at least have RAID 5 configured, which means you need enough disks in that server replicating to one-another, this allows a disk to fail without losing data as long as it's replaced before another disk fails. It's not a substitute for backups, but it's the bare minimum. Raid 10 is preferred for performance, but requires more disks.\n\n"

In other words, signal was cut off (which you obviously already know).\n\nIt just does not make sense to me, whether you're on an addressable tap or not, that they would shut off the entire building. Either the wiring is screwed up (I have seen cases where a tenant crawled in to the attic and tapped in to someone else's line...then moved out, causing the new tenant to get signal from the wrong tap port) or someone is really an complete idiot.

    "post": "Hello there, I'm having an extremely poor performance on my RX 580 since  yesterday, when I had a few problems trying to stream Wolfenstein II  with Discord's new feature \"Go Live\".   \n First things first, this is my setup:  \n \n\nCPU: Ryzen 5 2600  \n GPU: MSI Radeon RX 580 8gb  \n RAM: QUMOX 16gb (8x2) DDR4 2400MHz   \n MOBO: Asus TUF Gaming B450 Plus  \n OS: Windows 10 Pro 1903 18362.356  \n PSU: Corsair CX450  \n \n\nI've had this build for a lot of time now, never really had any problems  with it. The only issue I remember having was streaming games either on  twitch or mixer, which was basically impossible, since either the  streaming was stuttering and my game wasn't, or the game simply kept  stuttering and so did my stream. Anyways yesterday I wanted to stream  Wolfenstein II to a friend on Discord with the Go Live feature but as  soon as I started the streaming and did ALT+TAB back to the game my  computer would instantly BSOD with atikmdag.sys failing with  SYSTEM\\_THREAD\\_EXCEPTION\\_NOT\\_HANDLED.  \n I wanted to fix this issue so bad that I first checked for a new drivers  version (I hadn't updated my drivers to the last version yet, I still  had the ones from back in June 2019). I updated to 19.9.2 but nothing  changed, still BSOD. I tried different fixes, went to Radeon Settings  Global Wattman and changed Power Limit to +50% but nothing changed, same  error. So I went on further and looked for Chipset drivers, I installed  them, tried again, didn't work, checked for BIOS updates, installed it,  didn't work. So after spending a few hours without results, I decided  to use (stupidly) AMD's cleanup utility, and went ahead and removed my  drivers in Safe Mode. So then I reinstalled the GPU's drivers again, I  tried both 19.9.2 and an old version as well which wasn't optional, but  still same issue with the BSOD trying to stream. I read on a forum about  verifying those drivers with windows' verify, so I did, but nothing  changed.   \n So I reinstalled the drivers again with AMD's cleanup utility, I tried  one more time but didn't work. So I decided that it was the app's fault  and deleted it. I then downloaded DDU, used it to delete the current  drivers, tried again but still didn't work. So I went ahead and decided  to give Windows Update a shot, since I still had Windows April 2018  build. I updated everything to Windows 10 1903 build, I once again  uninstalled and reinstalled GPU drivers, still no change. I decided to  give up and just play the game, but I then noticed that it started  running really  badly. Before it ran at 120+ fps at default settings  (Ultra or High, I don't remember). Now I can't get past 65/70 fps! Also  changing game settings doesn't really influence the fps that much. I  disabled windows' fast boot. I ran a stress test to both GPU and PSU, I  also looked for errors, but nothing really. I finally did an  userbenchmark test, and where my CPU runs quite average, my GPU runs way  below average! I don't know what to do now, I also tried metro 2033  redux, before I could play it really smooth at 150+ fps, now it's a very  laggy 120 fps with stuttering feeling...  \n I NEVER OC'd any of my components, you might think the PSU is the issue  but I assure you it's not, RAM neither, I did a memcheck some time ago  and everything was alright.   \n Yesterday I also left my pc restarting inbetween all the driver  reinstalls, and when I came back I noticed it froze and my mouse wasn't  visible, as soon as I started spamming a few keys of my keyboard it  restarted.   \n BIOS doesn't do any error beeps, and I tried to check for GPU settings  but there is none since Ryzen doesn't have integrated graphics.  \n \n\nTl;dr I reinstalled my GPU drivers at least 10 times, updated chipset  and BIOS, and now I find myself with an underperforming way below  average GPU...  \n I really don't want to format my PC, I have 3TB of stuff that I don't  have time nor want to backup. That would really  be my last resort.  Thank you if you'll ever decide to help me\n\nEDIT AND SOLVED\nI want to thank everyone who helped me! I finally found a solution after everything we tried, I simply had to \"install\" the same bios update once again with ezflash3. The bios would fix itself. Now everything works greatly again, I can finally get back to enjoying 140fps Wolfenstein 2. \n\nP.S= even though the PCI-E remained 8x and not 16x the performance is good anyway, and I don't think it would increase even with 16x due to the fact of it being already Gen3.",

If I turned on the monitor even 1 second after turning on the computer, the monitor image would be normal.  \n \nI'd try swapping the monitor connections or try swapping between DVI and HDMI.  \n \nSome hardcore hardware people have fixed this kind of problem by changing the timing of the power-on reset signals in the power supply or monitor.",

Just to cover my bases, the next day, I chatted with a representative online and they confirmed my disconnection. But low and behold, this weekend I received a bill for the internet service that is disconnected. So I call and talk to a representative\u2014Joseph\u2014in their billing department. After every single word that I say, he says that I need to repeat myself. After 15 minutes, it was obvious that this was some kind of game so I told him that I'm recording the conversation. Immediately (notice how he heard exactly what I said the first time), he raises his voice and says I should get consent from him and that it was illegal because he's calling from the state of Florida. I know this to be true so I asked for permission and he starts the \"I-can't-hear-you\" game again. He eventually declined. We continued on for 10 more minutes and by then I had only give him the last four digits of my social security number to look at my account. I eventually ended the call due to unsafe spikes in my blood pressure. \n\nI've called a few times to talk to someone else, but every time I press the appropriate number to talk to the billing department, my phone is disconnected.\n\nDoes anyone know how to disconnect (completely) from Comcast?

If they fail to comply your next phone call will be to your state's prosecutor's office to file charges for fraud. \n\nState clearly that you no longer want their services and have paid for the services you have used through x date... and if they continue to bill you or harrass you for payment for any services beyond the date you have terminated your relationship with the company, you will pursue your options for legal remedy.\n\nGet harsh with them.

My brother was told his computer wasn't fixable and they tried to sell him a new one for $600 when it took me all of 5 minutes to diagnose the problem as a bad laptop keyboard and faulty AC adapter. $30-40 later and another 5 to 10 minutes to install the keyboard and he was a happy camper.\n\nAs for friends or acquaintances, they always recognize that I'm doing something that would otherwise be expensive and will give me something in return, whether it's veges from their garden, a home cooked meal, beer or a $50 tip. Fixing people's gear is also a good way to network and keep a list of contacts, so when you have a question about something you aren't familiar with, you can give someone else a call for advice.

    "post": "Hey everyone, \nI was involved in a car accident late last night. On the way home from work, a woman ran a red light at an intersection which resulted in me T-boning her van. Everyone was fine, and the cops arrived shortly after. I have no doubt of my right of way, having the green light, and her being 100% at fault. Fortunately my dash cam captured the entire incident, and I alerted the police of its presence at the scene. They asked to see the footage, so as to issue her a citation, but I was shaken up and could not get the files to play at that moment. I told them I would go home and transfer the files to my computer so I could send them to my insurance company. \n\nUnfortunately, when I attempted to view the files on both my PC and Mac, I received error messages and the files could not be played. I have spoken to my insurance company, and they informed me that she is disputing the events of last night, therefor leaving the claim as word v. word, which means I have no means of compensation for the accident. I again stressed that I am in possession of a dash cam, and they said they would contact her and remind her of that, being that she filed her claim online, rather than with a person. I'm not a wealthy person, but I am an excellent driver. I am so frustrated by the outcome of this, and I'm afraid I will be left carless and in deep financial trouble if I can't settle this claim in my favor.\n\nCan someone help my view these corrupted files? I have tested the camera before and have pulled video off of it plenty of times, but it seems as though the impact of the accident corrupted them. It's a pretty cheap camera but it has worked fine until now. I have googled a few solutions but nothing has helped as of yet. I have the files available to send if need be. Thanks for reading. \n\nEDIT: SOLVED. THANKS! \n\nEDIT 2: The software I used was the one suggested by u/tito13kfm from Grau GmbH, called Video Repair Tool. The program takes an existing working video from your camera source and compares it to the corrupted file in order to fill in the missing parts with usable data. I ended up paying 29 euros for 5 video repairs, which is insane, but I suppose these companies rely heavily on desperate people. Either way, it was well worth it since it allowed me to demonstrate to the insurance companies my claim of having a green light. I was on the phone with an agent while she watched the video:\n\nher: \"Ouch, just saw the accident.\"\n\nme: \"Yeah.\"\n\nher: \"You had the green.\"\n\nme: \"Yes.\"\n\nher: \"Clear as day.\"\n\nme: \"Clear as day.\"\n\n\nI am on the way to pick up a rental car and collect my things from my car. I cannot thank everyone enough for their interest and help in this situation. I will update this post soon with some video to satiate the curious, and I urge everyone to please get a dash cam!",

      "I know this is marked solved but I thought I would add to it since I have run in to a very similar situation... \n\nthe short answer is that most likely there is nothing wrong and you have just been accessing reddit from your phone using your cellular data and not wifi.  \n\nI was troubleshooting an issue with VPN from IOS devices a while back and noticed that it appeared someone was trying to hack one of my customers.  After changing things in their firewall and attempting to test it I was having trouble getting everything to work normally.  I turned up logging on the firewall so I could see what was going on and found the IP that appeared to be trying to hack the network hitting the firewall constantly.  the IP traced to Pennsylvania, nowhere near where I am or have ever been, and there were also other IPs from other places in and out of the state I am in (Alaska).  well, if you haven't already guessed... I opened a web browser on my phone and googled \"what is my ip\" so I could find it in the logs and found that the suspicious IP was mine.  so it appears AT&T is piping their traffic data to other sites, and of course, your public IP is going to show as whatever point it releases your traffic out to the internet.  so for whatever reason, AT&T was keeping my traffic in their network and routing it to Pennsylvania before finally letting it out to the internet.  My best guess was that their cell tower connects to their satellite, which then passes the data to one of their facilities elsewhere to reach the internet.  \n\nit's most likely that your cell provider is doing something similar.  Change your password to be safe, but also check what IP your phone is using occasionally by googling what is my IP and see if that's the case.",

Dont worry there is a way to backup important stuff\n\nWhen you are in CMD after pressing Shift + F10, type \"notepad\" this will open notepad, then navigate to File -> Open. Now, you have somewhat of a file explorer open to yourself, so just copy your stuff from windows drive to another disk or partition.

      "Get outside help, this isn't something you should mess with, especially when you know your limitations, you could drop the connection for the entire business and all they will do is blame you(and take legal action in some cases)\n\nYou are best finding a local MSP/IT company to set up some form of proper infrastructure, you are correct in the assumption it is probably overloaded, but so many things can go wrong with this that it's not worth the risk.\n",

      "As others have said, this is a potentially complex issue, and a 3rd party would most definitely be the best answer. But as you have come to us for help, I have outlined some basic steps as well as information about your problem so you can learn about it. I felt that you wouldn't have posted if you weren't interested to learn (as well as fix your problem). If this is the case, read on, if not, I'd start Googling local network support.\n\nTo start off, there is a device on your network that has a process running called a DHCP Server. What this does is hands out DHCP leases to any device on your network that requests one. The DHCP lease contains 4 items: an IP address, Netmask, Gateway IP and DNS IP. This is called a 'lease' because it has a set time period on how long the device is allowed to use that information in the lease. The DHCP server will also have a copy of the information in the lease, and blocks out that IP that was given so someone else doesn't use it. The lease time is usually set to a long time (a few days) but if you have lots of devices coming and going, you would reduce this so you don't run out of available IP addresses. (Side note - you can also set a Static IP on a device so that device will always use the static (never-changing) information, rather than what the DHCP server leases it)\n\nWhen you are doing a 'Renew Lease', all you are doing is asking the DHCP server if the lease you were using is still available, if so, renew it with the same details; if someone else has received that information when they requested a lease, your device will get the next sequential IP address (with the same Netmask, Gateway and DNS as before, these typically never change). What you are doing is doing no harm, but obviously there is an issue.\n\nWhat you want to do is a process of elimination when someone loses internet. You want to see what you can still access. If you make a visualisation in your head of the network, typically it will look something like this: CLIENT (device) > Wireless Access Point > Router > Internet. When someone loses access to the internet, you want to see if you can still access the Wireless Access point by pinging it. You will need to know it's IP address. In Terminal, type ping IPADDRESS (i.e. **ping 192.168.0.1**) and hit enter, this will start sending packets to that device. If it shows 'timed out' or something along those lines, it means the packet isn't getting to the device, or the device isn't returning the packet. This is usually where your issue will lie. If you can successfully ping the access point, that's when you see if you can talk to the router (again, with it's IP address). Eventually you should get to a device that is just blocking access for whatever reason, then you go from there.\n\nIt may also be that there are two DHCP servers in the network, and they are conflicting. For example if both the Wireless Access Point **and** the router are DHCP servers, and one is giving out incorrect information, then when a device queries for a new lease (because the lease period is 1 day, for example), the wrong DHCP server responds with incorrect info. Then when you are manually hitting renew, this queries the right one and voila, you're online.\n\nFeel free to post any questions about the above, or any process you're stuck with (getting IP addresses for example).",

    "postTitle": "Why do GIF's take forever to load, but I can stream 1080p  videos without buffering?",
    "bestcomment": [
      "GIFs are not really designed for video like they're used on /r/gifs.\n\n\nWe need to lay down some ground knowledge first.  Think of any motion picture as just that.... pictures designed to illustrate motion.  Each picture is shown one after the other at a high speed (24 to 60 per second).  Each individual picture is considered a *frame*.  To make this picture slideshow look like a movie, we need a minimum of 24 *frames per second*, or 24 pictures being displayed each second.\n\nMost videos you watch have compression.  One of the more popular video compression methods is [Group of Pictures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_pictures).  Without getting too technical, all you need to know is that the video itself doesn't store the full content of each frame.  Group of Picture uses an I-frame (think of this as a key frame, a full frame with full data) and then subsequent frames afterwards that only contain some data (IE only showing you what's changed).  If you've ever seen a video on YouTube or your favourite media player glitch out where some splotches are green or black and random blocks change colours before the video goes back to normal, you've seen the effects of GoP compression.  \n\nA GIF doesn't understand any of that.  For a GIF to work, it needs the full content of each frame in the animation.  This is fine for simple 5 frame animation GIF, but not the large GIFs you see people trying to use.  That's why so many GIFs you see used for Internet memes are only a few seconds long.  A truly uncompressed video (.avi file, although even that extension is used for DivX compression) works in a somewhat similar manner (at least at a high level), and will eat up gigabytes worth of data in mere minutes.\n\nAnother interesting topic with GIFs is colour reproduction.  Each frame can only have a maximum of 256 colours (or an 8 bit palette map).  Unfortunately this causes colour banding and weird looking images (you need a 24-bit palette map to define *true* colour), but can be solved with [dithering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither).  Dithering is why every gif you've ever seen looks grainy.  The cat example in the linked article is fantastic.\n\nAs far as buffering... all of your videos actually buffer.  Buffering is the idea that the video loads a certain amount of time ahead before it starts playing the video.  With YouTube, the video may download a 5 second buffer before it starts playing.  The idea is that the rest of the video is downloading while you're watching it, allowing you to stream the video.  Buffering is the reason why you can watch a YouTube video immediately, but need to wait the full hour (or however long it takes) for a full torrented video to download before you can even begin watching it.\n\nGIFs don't understand the concept of buffering or waiting until fully downloaded to play.  A GIF just stores the images, some information on the amount of delay tmie per frame, and the number of times to replay each frame (where 0 is unlimited, or loop... not part of the GIF file standard but introduced by Netscape years ago).  It will start displaying frames immediately.  If the next frame isn't available at the end of the delay time from the previous frame, the GIF will wait until the frame data is fully loaded and display it.  This is why the GIF will get stuck and move along choppily until it hits its first repeat.  By then the GIF frames are completely loaded and the animation can play correctly.",
      "A lot of it has to do with the gif compression, too. There are 10, 12 MB gifs that would be 3MB youtube clips.\n\nThis whole gif craze has really been a negative towards UX. Reddit feels like a 14 year old inner-city latina's MySpace page. Just missing the blinking fairies, really.",
      "Animated GIFs aren't near as well compressed as most video files on the Internet. Animation was an afterthought to the GIF standard. GIF isn't even a particular great image format and it's only popular because it's the only animated image format most browsers happen to natively support, and for a long time it was the only image format that supported transparency that all common browsers supported.",
      "- 1 second of a high quality gif (MB) **>** 1 second of a SD or HD web video (MB)\n\n- gifs don't have preloading or an initial buffer; video players do pre-load the video for just a few seconds, usually without the viewers noticing. This gives an advanced start to the loading vs playback.\n\nThis would actually be an interesting extension or add-on to browsers...  gif preloading!",
      "Aside from bandwidth...\n\nIIRC\n\n1080p video on youtube is played in h264 format which is a common compression format because of the high quality and relatively small file size.\n\nA GIF is uncompressed and needs to be rendered frame by frame as it plays without the ability to buffer beforehand.\n\nedit: spelling",

    "post": "So I've been having some major cooling issues recently. I got a good pre-built gaming PC a year ago, everything worked fine until I start playing Red Dead Redemption 2 a few days ago. It ran great for a week until one day I notice really bad frame-rate drops and check the temperature with CoreTemp to see a 90-100\u00b0C disaster. I of course shut the PC down right after.\n\nI thought maybe the fans stopped working as I didn't clean the dust out for the whole year. I opened the PC case but there was surprisingly barely any dust, and both fans + my water-cooling work just fine. So instead I took off the water-cooled heatsink, and replaced the default thermal paste with some NT-H1. Pea-shaped. Put the heat-sink back on, and I see temperatures are back to 30-40\u00b0C at idle, and 55-68\u00b0C when playing games (even Red Dead). This is where it gets weird. 5 days later, I notice my PC is throttling again. I open up CoreTemp and the fucking temperatures somehow got back to 90-100\u00b0C. Fans still work fine, the water-cooling still works fine, and nothing should have changed physically. So I think maybe I put too much or too little thermal paste. So I replace it again, way less this time. The temperatures are fine again, 3 days later, back to 90\u00b0C. I replace them 3 more times, twice they don't drop at all (Likely put too much), and the third time it only drops for a day. As I'm writing this post I've just replaced the thermal paste again so my temperatures are 28-38\u00b0C, the lowest I've ever seen them, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time before they climb back up again.\n\nWhat could possibly be wrong that makes it change this way? I don't think it can be any permanent flaw as the temperatures would never be low that way. But nothing changes day-to-day that would make them climb like this. Any ideas?\n\nI should also mention that these temperature increases happen literally over-night. I check it right before shutting the PC off, and they remain at 30-40\u00b0C, but then just as I turn it back on the next day, they are at 75\u00b0C at the least.\n\n**EDIT:** Now I've managed to confirm the temperatures ONLY go down once the PC is shut off. Left it on overnight, and instead of being overheated the next morning like it was the last two days, the temperatures are still the lowest I've seen them. Any ideas on what this means?",

      "If you crack open most 2.5\" SSDs, you'll find they're mostly just a hollow plastic shell, and the actual parts aren't much more than you'd see on a USB flash drive. An M.2 SSD is about the size of a stick of RAM and can get those up to at least a Terabyte right now.  Space isn't the limiting factor in Flash Storage.  The actual medium is.\n\nAnd since you can get plates to mount the 2.5 in a 3.5 slot, there's not really any reason to make them in that form factor.",

      "[deleted]",
      "2.5 inch is only for compatibility with existing systems. More modern equipment is dropping that form factor, and is starting to use its own, smaller housing, such as mSATA, which is typically only a rectangular card  of 3 by 5 cm. See [SSD form factors](https://www.techspot.com/amp/guides/768-ssd-form-factors/).",

      "Because you can fit a 2.5\" in a laptop.",
      "The limiting factor with 2.5\" & 3.5\" Form factors is the SATA interface which maxes out at a speed of 6 Gb/s. The M.2 SSD has a theoretical max speed of 8 Gb/s to 32 Gb/s depending on the speed of the PCIe bus. \n\nSo my own theory is that it makes the most sense to attempt to make advancements where performance improvements can felt the most rather than make an advancement towards an outdating technology that has already reached its potential. There's nothing new, surprising, or exciting about the SATA hdd form factor. Even if they could pack a 3.5\" form factor with huge blazing fast flash technology the absolute max speed is limited to 6 Gb/s because of the interface, that's far from impressive looking into the future where things are going.",
      "That's because of storage chip prices. Even 2.5\" SSDs aren't fully filled by it. Prices, prices and prices once more. But if somebody made 3.5\" filled SSD then it would be blazingly fast. They might be even faster than m.2 NVMe drives."

    "post": "So here's the issue.\n\nI bought an Arris SB 6141 because it was cheaper than renting from TWC. I have recently moved to an apartment complex that only offers WOW. No big deal for me, internet is internet right? Wrong.  \n\nWhen negotiating our contract with WOW they said that my modem would not work with them as TWC had probably installed firmware on my modem that prevents it from accepting new activation packets. I figured this was just them trying to get me to rent their modem and brushed it off. But sure enough when the tech showed up, the 6141 would power cycle nonstop without accepting the new service. So I went ahead and let WOW install their modem just so I could have internet while I did some troubleshooting.  \n\nI got on the phone with TWC and they either played dumb or had no idea about firmware issues and passed me on to Arris. Arris support was actually super helpful and after doing the typical factory resets and basic stuff he had me check the signals for the Arris modem. I don't remember the exact numbers off the top of my head but they were jumping and beyond the normal range. Arris then told me to contact WOW and have them check their signals.  \n\nSo I went ahead and called WOW and they sent a technician out who then said that the signals were fine (I checked later and they seemed to be in the normal range as well) and they stated that the outlier signals I was reading on the 6141 was due to the firmware TWC installed preventing the modem from accepting their signal.  \n\nIt was at this point in the game where I realized that I was in over my head and have no idea how to proceed.  \n\nMy friend just bought the exact same modem and is planning on using it with TWC but I want to borrow it and make sure it works on WOW to possibly confirm/debunk the TWC firmware issue.  \n\nIF it turns out that TWC does install proprietary firmware on my modem preventing me from using it with other ISPs, is there anyway I can overwrite my modem's firmware? If not is there any chance for me to get TWC to admit fault(HA!) and reimburse me for my now bricked modem?  \n\nThanks in advance for any insight. I really have a feeling I'm being played by an ISP(what are the odds!). I'm just not sure which one.  \n  \n  \n**Update:**  \nAfter doing some more research based on your responses (you guys are all awesome btw) I realized that the firmware build time was BEFORE it was connected with TWC so therefore they didn't install firmware on my modem.  \n\nWith this in mind I will say that I ended service with TWC and disconnected my modem before my service was physically cut off (They provided internet for an additional 12 days after I made the call to end service). Would this cause issues with my modem as it likely never received an end of service packet. Would that prevent it from attaining new activation packets (even though it was factory reset?).\n\n**Update 2:**  \nI called TWC and they have confirmed that my modem has been removed from their lists and they are no longer claiming it as under their jurisdiction.  \n\nAs suggested I will reach out to WOW again and see if I can't get some answers here.\n\n\n**Update 3:**  \nI've been on the phone with Arris and WOW again. Arris claims my downstream power level (10dBmV) is way too low for the modem (can anyone confirm this? I checked online and that seems to be reasonable). They did say that they are getting a lot of calls from WOW customers with my exact issue and that some have had success by escalating at WOW. So that's what I did.  \n\nWOW Supervisors were still unable to connect to my modem and told me there was nothing they could do. So I'm back to square one. I'm still going to wait and test out my buddy's modem and see if it in fact my modem that is the issue.  \n\n**Update 4:**\nTested a friend's brand new same model Arris Modem which connected just fine so since I was real sick of all the finger pointing I ended up cashing in on Arris's Warrenty Policy. They're sending me a new one which I expect will work just fine. I'm sorry I wasn't able to see this to it's conclusion but at this point I just want a working modem. Bummer one of the ISPs didn't have to pay as I still believe it is one of their faults :/\n\nEdit:    \n\nSome Technical Information  \nFirmware Name: SB_KOMODO-1.0.6.14-SCM01-NOSH  \nFirmware Build Time: Mar 6 2014 15:23:55",

",
      "IT has many paths. Some people do it \"their way,\" and have tons of success, yet others follow \"the rules,\" making make sound decisions, but still get the short end of the stick too often. That's just life.\nI've been in Tech for 17 years, and my experience = getting a job is sometimes more of a challenge than doing the job. So my answer focuses on getting your first/next job.\n\nChange is the only constant. Good News: IT only changes in the following ways:\n\u2022\tJob Titles, Duties, Responsibilities, Descriptions, & Requirements\n\u2022\tBusiness Practices & Processes\n\u2022\t Technologies Itself\n\u2022\tCompanies (starting, merging, spinning off, acquiring one another, going out of business)\n\u2022\tLaw and regulations affecting IT\n\u2022\tMost other things.\n\nBad News: this covers roughly EVERTTHING except people in general. One great reason to understand how  people react to things is that in IT, human behavior ends up being about the only REAL constant.\nAfter working support for a large tech company for 6 years, I decided on a career in IT, and thought a degree would help. \nImmediately after high school I attended a traditional university and passed the core classes before dropping out mostly from no motivation to attend school AND work 40+ hours/week. After deciding to go back (16 years later), I took some business courses where I then lived, but eventually finished at WGU online. I was already 3rd year student, so most of what I had left was earning specific IT certs, and the rest was mostly projects.\nI qualified for student loans and most of what I studied for was the certs. As I went, I earned more IT certs, and at the end, I had my B.S. in IT. The degree wasn\u2019t the magic bullet I hoped for, but it was worth it, as my current great job requires it.\n\nHere are some things which SHOULD affect one's ability to get a job, plus my opinion on how they REALLY affect getting the job.\n\nDegree \u2013 Whether a certain job requires a degree or not varies company to company. A degree will not get you a job, or even open doors, but it will UNLOCK some DOORS you can then open yourself. A degree gives the HR person system one less reason to toss your application if you apply for a job requiring one. If all jobs requiring a degree were in a stack, and all the jobs NOT requiring a degree were in 2nd stack, wouldn\u2019t you rather have access to BOTH stacks? It increases your likelihood of ending up with a GOOD job. It also exposes you to business concepts affecting you and those who control your job. If you aren't interested in business, go for Comp Science instead, since IT is a function of business, and business either enables or chokes everything IT does.\n\nCertifications- Expose you to the concepts covered by the cert. If you are new to a tech, they help you wrap your head around it. Some positions (esp. entry level ones) require certain certs). HOWEVER, the higher you go, the less likely a cert will help you get the job, AND some managers see listing certs as a sign that you are a \u201cpaper only\u201d engineer vs. truly skilled.\n\nMost jobs are not won by someone who just applied for the job. Instead, they usually go to someone who knows someone... (NETWORKING \u2013 the social kind). Still, most people start out NOT knowing people who can help them get the job they want. At that point, you can only start networking (a slow process), while ALSO working on other aspects that help you look like the best fit for your desired job.\n\nExperience- the #1 legitimate qualification for most jobs. The more experience you already have doing the same job you're applying for (or at least some of the same skills or duties), the more the hiring manager will believe you can do THIS job.\n\nWho You Know \u2013 Someone telling the hiring manager: \u201cThis person should be considered for this job.\u201d = the #1 thing that can help you get an interview. This is why networking is critical over the long run. If you are introverted, realize NOW that others are also introverted who you don\u2019t realize, only they have come to grips with the fact that enabling themselves to be anti-social is going to COST them hundreds of thousands or more dollars + the freedom of choices they can make, over the course of their career. You don\u2019t have to become a social butterfly, but at least start facing the reality that a machine isn\u2019t ever going to pay you money; people are, and people only want to give large amounts of money to people they at least know if not trust. Social skills are learnable, as as any other skill commonly held by normal people. The more introverted you are, the sooner you should begin your journey, since it doesn\u2019t come naturally (all this is from experience).\nLinkedIn helps a lot in networking endeavors, but it is only a tool, not your entire arsenal. You can\u2019t do all of your networking through LinkedIn, just some of your research, a place to go back later, for reference, and a place for a potential employer to go see your profile. What your interviewer sees there should be all good and zero bad (see next section for more information RE: what = good and what = bad).\n\nInterviewing skills: I spent 40 years largely ignorant RE the psychology of selling. If you don\u2019t understand anything about sales or selling, put it on your calendar, the sooner the better, because this will also make a HUGE difference over the course of your career (regardless of your field). No one can have any job until they are successful in selling themselves (and there is a TON of competition). Generally speaking, you have to convince the hiring manager that they have a particular problem, and that YOU are the best solution to that problem. Sometimes the first part is already done for you, or they wouldn't be conducting interviews in the first place. But sometimes their perception of the problem is not what that they need to have to see YOU as the best solution.\nIn a nutshell, Interview skills mean understanding what goes through the head of the hiring manager, avoiding coming across as one who will give them headaches, make them look bad to their manager, or have to be replaced again soon, instead coming across as someone who is going to make their job easier, and make them look good to his or her own manager. \n\n\u201cFit\u201d \u2013 This is part of selling that you are the best solution to the problem. Managers are people, as are any other people you may work with, and a work relationship is a type of social relationship. Your ability to fit in with the team is a big determining factor whether the company will have to replace you within a few months or not. I am the last person to suggest that everyone become the master of office politics, but you should at least understand how groups of people think to a degree, and avoid things that are going to alienate them & make them want you to go away.\n\nSocial Skills:\nIf you are smart enough to have technical skills that can alone get you a great job, great! If you build on that, you can end up being a guru or \u201crock star\" & make good pay, at least for a time. However, most people aren\u2019t this talented. And some people may have world a class technical skill, but then a shift in business can make the skill irrelevant. Even though big bucks only come after specializing in something, avoid being a one-trick pony. Strive for balance in life and learn things that you don\u2019t have to learn, even if they are not adjacent to your primary speciality (you will be surprised later when those unlikely skills are what you need to move forward when you least expect it).\nAs did most in IT in the early 2000s, I found myself competing on the world job market. I didn't expect to compete with people across the world before this happened. I was replaced by people with advanced degrees which were paid for by their government, and whose cost of living was a mere fraction of mine. It seemed unfair at the time, but focusing on \u201cfairness\u201d wouldn't allow me to succeed.\nI have a passion for technology, but I\u2019m no guru in any one technology or skill. I had to totally regroup and start over. \nThe good news is that you don\u2019t have to be a rock star to make money in IT; you just have to get yourself in a place where you have the opportunity to show yourself trustworthy and smart enough to not kill the business. Figure out if there is a more efficient way to do what you do, or if what you are currently doing has any security gaps. If you want to excel in management and know how to stand out, a large company may be the place, or maybe a startup, where you can get in on the ground floor.\nUnless you are a master of soft skills, my advice is to avoid office politics even though you should you stay AWARE of them, because politics are fickle, and will eventually bite you. If politics ruins where you work, find a job somewhere less driven by office politics. A place where people have passion about their jobs is a good candidate. Places where it\u2019s just a paycheck for most people will be more likely to have people with nothing better to do than stir up trouble, play mind games, and get their jollies exerting control over others. Sometimes you can escape a job from office politics hell by transferring to a different division within the same company. This is another reason to have social ties with people, because they can  tell you if the department they work in is better than yours in this aspect. Glassdoor.com reviews sometimes help in this aspect (or at least help you know where not to bother applying).\nIf you are the type who enjoys rolling up your sleeves and getting the feel for the technology, a smaller org may be the place for you. Even there, don\u2019t stop to polish every bit and byte, because soon enough there will be a faster/more efficient way to do it that will make your polishing irrelevant. Stay in touch with trends so you can see this type of thing coming; always try to see how the next thing in tech really fits in with what you already do.",

Now, if it returns any actual malware (red entries, not yellow), proceed to run Combofix\n* I don't recommend running Combofix unless there are real serious trojans/worms/viruses\n* Now run Hitman Pro, this should find any left over traces, it will ask you if you want to register, just click the free 30 day license and enter in any email (can be bogus).\n* Delete ADWcleaner quarantine from C:\\ADWcleaner (Hitman might already do this)\n* Reset all browsers back to default, making sure no nasty extensions are installed or enabled\n* Run MSCONFIG again and set startup options back to normal. \n* Run Autoruns for windows and delete any entries that look suspicious (be conservative here, they should pop out as a similar name to infections that have been removed). \n* Run CCleaner again, check the startup tabs under tools to make sure you got everything with Autoruns, if not delete startup entries from here. After that, run a full clean with this program as well as a registry clean. \n* Perform a final scan with Malwarebytes, if it comes back clean you should be good to go!\n\nThere may also be some instances when you run into rootkits, a lot of the time these are nasty enough that it will save you time to just backup and reload the machine, but you can try a tool such as MBar (Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit) to see if it can clean them out. \n\nEdit: added some steps I forgot. Also if the machine is really infected to where you can't even work with it in normal boot, you may need to try Safeboot with networking in order to get startup items disabled before continuing work. ",
      "There are three main methodologies - one of which you've already mentioned. Starting from scratch by reformatting is sometimes the appropriate course of action, but not always. If the machine has an *actual* virus (file infector, macro, etc) such as Virut or Sality then a reformat should always be performed. Rootkits, bootkits and backdoor Trojans warrant consideration at the very least, however, it may depend on the purpose or function of the machine, and the owner's wishes. Nowadays, the importance of performing a reformat is diminishing due to security enhancements in the Windows OS. For example, kernel-mode rootkits such as TDL3, once very prevalent several years ago, are rarely seen nowadays due to security features such as Secure Boot and the forcing of signed kernel drivers in 64-bit Windows.\n\n---\n\nThe second methodology is a scattergun approach. Run a whole myriad of malware removal programmes hoping something works. For simple issues involving adware and Potentially Unwanted Programmes (PUPs), which are not inherently malicious, this method will most likely prove sufficient. However, when dealing with more complex and sophisticated malware, this may not be sufficient, and require a diagnostic approach as explained below.\n\n---\n\nThe third methodology is a systematic diagnostic approach, where the affected machine is diagnosed, a plan of action prepared and then implemented. This method is very much manual in the sense scriptable programmes are instructed to remove specific items (files, folders, registry keys/values, etc) with the use of a script or set of instructions. This is not something picked up straight off the bat, and requires training and an understanding of Windows components and constructs. [UNITE](http://uniteagainstmalware.com/), for example, is an organisation that offers such training. \n\n---\n\nThat is not to say if you wish to remove malware you must partake in such training. But if your desire is to possess a more complete and proficient understanding in the art of malware removal, there is a lot more too it than simply running a whole host of programmes in a row.",
      "We exchange money for years of knowledge and trial and error. ",
      "Regarding some of the other suggestions:\n\nWhile Malwarebytes is an excellent tool, be aware that it's only free for personal use. If you want to use it in a commercial environment (like a store), they would need to pay for the correct license.",
      "I use Malwarebytes and recently /r/tronscript. But tron didn't remove it once then i did malwarebytes on its own and it found 35,000 infections",
      "One thing that hasn't been mentioned:\n\nAVG and others make bootable CD's that can be ran prior to system start, and hopefully before any virus or malware loads. At that point, it can be used to remove infections. After that, I'd move to safe mode and run things like Malwarebytes and etc. \n\nBut, don't underestimate the power of a GOOD backup. Bootable CD's aren't going to help you if a piece of ransomware like cryptolocker comes and encrypts all of your files. ",
      "Personally, working at my dads shop when I was young we'd use a combination of Malwarebytes and...I think it was CCleaner? Something like that. Would fix most issues. Some, like rootkits, are nasty enough that you just have to wipe and reinstall.",

Different infections require different tools, order in which they're ran, perhaps some manual removal...google is your friend, and the more you do, the better you become at it.  It's not some magical combination...that's like asking \"I want to work as a mechanic, how do I fix an engine?\"  Not only is the question too broad, but there's some things that can't be given a solid answer.  Instinct, repetition, experience, gut feelings, and innovation (usually thinking out of the box gets you a LONG way in IT) is key for that sort of position.",

    "post": "Hello Reddit! I've been having problems with my gaming PC for a few months now. After starting it for the first time of the day (i.e. when starting cold), when the PC is under heavy workload (e.g. running a game like Skyrim), it usually just shuts off within 5-10 minutes. I can reliably reproduce this issue. I think this happened once outside a game, but it usually happens only when I start a game. Today, it shut off in the Skyrim main menu after browsing save files.\n\nThe nature of the crash is just that it shuts down. No BSOD. No freezing. No residue whatsoever. It just blacks out and boots back up without issue immediately. Then the PC runs well for the rest of the day.\n\nThe build is from 2012. I upgraded to the 970 in 2015. PcPartPicker: [https://pcpartpicker.com/user/marcopennekamp/saved/gQZbXL](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/marcopennekamp/saved/gQZbXL). Despite the k-version CPU, nothing is overclocked.\n\nI've run OpenHardwareMonitor today with logging: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yx-EhtNoB1Let5gZ2urlFqaKbD6QiDbt](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yx-EhtNoB1Let5gZ2urlFqaKbD6QiDbt). Look for 01/14/2019 08:33:33, which is the last entry before the crash happens. \n\nI'm having trouble troubleshooting (love the word combo here) this issue. From googling around and reading a lot, I have a few main culprits:\n\n* My PSU is over 6 years old and only had a standard 2 year warranty. Its reviews were solid at the time, but also not stellar. As far as I can see, a random \"blackout-style\" shutdown may very well be a PSU issue. I think the voltages reported in the OHM log above are pretty stable, but maybe the PSU runs into some issues when running cold and having to supply a lot of power very suddenly?\n* A RAM stick could be faulty when running cold. I've run memtest and everything seems to be fine, but I haven't run it cold (only stumbled upon that possibility today). I'll maybe test that tomorrow. I'm not sure if the RAM is overclocked, but task manager (yes, not the most reliable source) reports it as running at 1600MHz, which would actually be underperforming.\n* My HDD could be failing silently, but it's relatively new (had to replace my old one which I took from my PC before) and its SMART values look OK. See here: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eKnAZClISCarMEntyStEl6jr793R7yxW](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eKnAZClISCarMEntyStEl6jr793R7yxW). The Seek Error Rate is the only value that concerns me.\n* My mainboard could be failing. I haven't read much into that, however, because I want to rule out the other options first. It would really, really suck if it was my mainboard, since I'd have to replace my i7-3770k, which runs *perfectly* fine. I don't have CPU performance problems and a comparable modern high-mid CPU gives only a 20% performance increase.\n\nThere is one incident of stupidity I have to mention, too. Perhaps you've noticed by looking at the SMART values, but the temperatures have a pretty high Worst count. That is because I let my PC run hot for several days or weeks after moving to a new apartment (the outer metal of the case was easily 35\u00b0C, if not more). The airflow of the Lian-Li was obstructed, because I set the PC in a desk with only front and back open. Since the Lian-Li is partially closed at the front, the air couldn't move well enough. I had to remove the front cover and now temps are fine again.\n\nI'm seeking help in identifying the issue. Perhaps someone here has had a similar experience, or can give me advice specifically targeted to my parts list. This PC has been running very solidly, I've never had any other issues with it, but I wouldn't be surprised if some parts are close to their end of life. My SSD (which has been with the PC since day one) reports 16500 runtime hours with 2132 power-on counts.\n\nRegardless of what the issue is, I am currently planning to replace two parts this month:\n\n* I've read up on the [Crucial MX500](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/h3tQzy/crucial-mx500-1tb-25-solid-state-drive-ct1000mx500ssd1) and think that at its current price point of just 120\u20ac, it's the perfect time to switch to an SSD as a single drive. My current SSD is running fine, but I'm honestly sick of managing two drives in Windows and want to benefit from the improved performance of an SSD when it comes to game startup times. Also, on the off-chance that my HDD is failing, I'll have peace of mind with a new SSD.\n* I want to replace the bequiet with a [Corsair RM550x](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/bqVD4D/corsair-rmx-2018-550w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-cp-9020177-na). I've read up on PSUs and think this is the ultimate 550W option for my needs. I'm more interested in reliability than having the latest hardware and will probably never need more than a 550W PSU, so that 10 year warranty looks really sweet to me. I have one question about the RMx: Is there any difference to the 2018 version I linked compared to [this](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/3zNypg/corsair-power-supply-cp9020090na) version?\n\nHaving read my case, what do you think is causing these \"blackout-style\" shutdowns? Are there any diagnostic steps I can take with testing especially the mainboard? Or should I just replace my PSU before I even attempt to test anything else, because it's nearing its end of life anyway?\n\nThanks for your help in advance!",

They asked me if I had a reciept for my fucking 4 year old computer, I brought the setup disks and stuff I got with the computer but they told me unless I had reciept cant do anything.\n\nMind you I have had tnis computer serviced before.  If you are still here I need your help still if you are willing.  There is a firmware password on the computer and cannot unlock.  I vaguely remember setting it but I have changed close to 20 passwords in the last week.  I forget setting it, not saying I didnt.  Supposedly there is a workaround, but I dont kniw of one still working MB pro 8,2 .  No superdrive working.  Im rationalizing apples constant managemnt on little snitch now, but you guys have me thinking doubts. This is NUMBER ONE\n\nPOSSIBLE SCENARIO\nOK while I was waiting for hours Iwas checking my regular emails and also apps that I have under my accounts.  I thi k I found the the issue to one problem.  4 months ago while practicing I opened a Heroku account.  I Had it linked with my github which was in turn Iinked to my  Github for Mac.  I als o only forked one thing my own package.  WHATS THIS https://github.com/devenvelope/volatility.  I had my mapand an open source map I made and shared publicly for the homeless and resources for them.  I Havent used the account since then.  This application was deployed.  I linked my google account and a pop up popped up logged into gihub about another IP being logged.  Also in san francisco and very similar to mine, Im on my tablet but I think its my phone. Also there are other logins with the most populous being from columbus ohio and a link I followed from github shows this most populous  http://i.imgur.com/wjjnlnt.png   I have never been there then my ip on different applications like Kloudless Google drive and github mmobile github firefox and numerous others I never signed up for.\nAnd then programming link towards a dns I USED to use, now nooope.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yWOCmAR.png http://i.imgur.com/TxwyQWI.png ",

I'm going to echo what others have said: you need help.  See a doctor; your mind is playing tricks on you.\n\nThere's no reason why people would be stalking you in the way you think.  You're a normal guy, not some evil billionaire in a Hollywood movie under assault by a crack team of hackers.\n\nCall your doctor RIGHT NOW.  If they're closed, call first thing tomorrow morning.  You need help, and you can't put this off.  Please.",
      "Your mind is playing tricks on you.  Schedule a meeting with your Dr. or even urgent care immediately.  following your mind down this path of craziness only makes it harder to fix.\n\nI saw this exact thing happen to a co-worker that was incredibly smart and had many degrees in CS.  He basically hacked our own network trying to find out who was spying on him.  He was showing me tracelogs and all sorts of things that were normal background noises on the internet and in software.\n\nEdit: I read in one of your other posts that you have already been tested as being paranoid-schitzo. Maybe you should completely disconnect for a while. Don't use your pc, switch to a feature phone. Whatever you think you would need to do to convince yourself you are safe from being spied on. Are you even a high-value target?",
      "OP, please at least consider the advice from people here and go consult your doctor. Explain to him/her your current sleep schedule, and the fears you're experiencing.\n\nThe only thing I can do is to try convince you that a lot of what you're talking about is guess-work, assumptions based on little fact, or just completely made-up as your brain tries to make connections that aren't really there.\n\n> the mac was using a fibre channel, which is capable, but i didnt set up. The windows under processes had Bonjour and was connecting.\n\nYour Macbook Pro does not have a fibre card, nor does it have *any physical capability* of connecting to a fibre network. Meanwhile, the process \"Bonjour\" on a Windows installation is simply a part of iTunes and -in essence- is used to establish connections to network devices *for use with your iPhone*. This is not an inherently malicious process.\n\nLook at both these cases, and please realise that what you're doing is drawing conclusions from thin-air. The things you're experiencing are for the most part standard practice, and the occasions where things seem a bit odd are more than likely your mind playing tricks on you. Ever had a dream that felt so real that you woke up and thought it was still happening? The mind is a powerful thing and -given the right stimulus- can convince you of all sorts of erroneous things.\n\n> In the informstion tab which looks at the process it said query and a bunch of lines of code and then com.microsoft on a fresh version of osx.\n\nAgain, this is totally normal. OSX needs the ability to connect to Microsoft Windows PCs, otherwise how do you expect it to function on a mixed OS network? You're connecting dots that don't exist. Please take this as a sign that you should consult a doctor.\n\n> How can I make my network totally secure? What steps should I use, Im willing to spend anything at this point.\n\nThe fact that you're willing to spend anything to secure your network is also telling of a larger concern that you're not thinking right. *Please* **please** be careful OP. You say that this is already affecting your work & social life. Throwing money at a problem that doesn't exist could have much more severe ramifications on your life. It's important that you keep your finances in check, and **don't go throwing money at products, software or hardware** for the sake of satisfying this paranoia.\n\nI really truly do hope you take our advice and seek professional help. More important than saving you from being spied in, we want to see you saved from what's currently going on in your head. Please take care OP.",

If you have a better place for me to post, let me know and I'll post there.\n\n---\n\nSo at about 3pm today (eastern time) I got a call from a number I've never seen. I answer and they say \"Hey, you call me?\" I say no and we hang up. Not 5 seconds later I get another call from another number and I answer it, we have a similar exchange and I hang up. Again, another call from another number which I rejected. Again and again and again, someone calls and I reject it.\n\nI have been getting phone calls for 4 hours now from all different people saying I called them. My phone doesn't go more than 3 seconds without a phone call. My voice mail box fills up faster than I can delete the messages. And now people are texting me back with all kinds of crazy messages, as if I'm a telemarketer saying things like \"Please take me off your list!\" or \"I'm on the DO NOT CALL LIST\". It's constant. I've even gotten some threatening messages talking about killing me, and another guy who thought I was someone who is sleeping with his girlfriend and has threatened to kill himself. I can't keep my phone from ringing long enough to test him to straighten it out.\n\n---\n\nSo my guess is someone is doing some sort of DDOS where they are robo-dialing hundreds or thousands of numbers, and spoofing it so it looks like the call is coming from me. Then they hang up, leaving those people to return calls to me, which results in me being over loaded.\n\nI called the phone company, and they were completely unhelpful. They first asked me if the phone was in my pocket at the time, as if to imply I butt dialed these people. Yeah, I butt dialed 2,000 people, idiot. Then he said hes never heard of anything like this, and to just turn my phone off for the time being and call back tomorrow if it persist and they will change my number. I don't want to fucking change my number. \n\n---\n\nSo my question is this:\n\n* Does anyone have any more information about a scam or attack that might be happening to me? Like more reading or some terms I can google? I can't find anything about this happening anywhere else online.\n\n* Any idea how to stop it? I'm gonna be mad if I have to change my number. It seems like bullshit that the phone company can't stop this kind of attack. Why do they even allow spoofing when it opens the doors to this type of thing. I would hope there is like an FCC website where I can report it and find the people doing it to get them in trouble, but I'm guessing the phone company will say they can't trace spoofed calls.\n\n* Any information is appreciated.\n\n\n---\n\nTL;DR - Receiving calls faster than I can reject them from all different numbers, want to make it stop or more info.",

    "postTitle": "Am I killing my laptop battery by keeping it plugged in 90% of the time?",
    "bestcomment": [
      "Yes and no.\n\nYou have to understand how batteries work.\n\nBatteries have a limited amount of full charge cycles they're supposed to be good for. A full cycle is one charge from 0% to 100%. A charge from 50% to 100% would be 1/2 cycle, and a charge from 90% to 100% would be 1/10 cycle. \n\nUsually manufacturers guarantee that the battery will be good for 300 full cycles. \"Good\" meaning it will retain at least 80% of it's charge when it was brand new. HP and maybe some other manufacturers offer *Long Life* batteries, which are good for 1000 cycles, but that's a different matter.\n\nWhen you have your battery plugged in and the laptop is connected to power the battery doesn't stay charged at 100% all the time because that is bad for the battery (it's lifespan shortens if it's constantly at 100%). So the computer does a neat trick, where it lets the battery deplete and then charges the battery by a few % constantly. You might sometimes notice your battery says it's at 95% or 98% even when you've had it plugged in for hours. This is why.\n\nThese minimal 3-5% charges all contribute to the total 100 full cycles of the battery lifespan. \n\nLet's say the notebook does **1** 95%-100% charge per hour, that's 5% of a full cycle. So in 20 hours the battery will do 1 full cycle even though your notebook was constantly connected to the mains. \n\nBasically you're not harming the battery in any way by having it in your laptop constantly, but it does use up the battery's cycles. Because of this the battery's lifespan shortens.\n\nEDIT: made a mistake with manufacturer full cycles, it's more like 300 and 1000 from 100 and 300.",
      "is it a good idea to pull the battery when I'm using the cord for longer periods of time?  I rarely use my battery, actually, so it seems like a good idea to me.",
      "All of the answers you have recieved are incomplete. [Read this.](http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/899-battery-myths-li-ion-battery-management)\n\n> When storing batteries for long periods of time without use, unplug the device and leave the battery with a 40-70% charge. Store the battery in a cool and dry environment - like the coolest part of the house. Don't leave the device plugged in for weeks or months on end without use - this will destroy the battery's ability to retain a charge. If the battery's natural discharge depletes it below usable levels (i.e. below 2.5V), its smart system will disable the battery's ability to retain a charge, as charging it from a true-0 state could result in a fire. This is also true for overuse and abuse of a battery.",
      "So much good and bad information. When clients tell me all these old precautions meant for NiCad I want to bang my face on anything nearby. It has a certain amount of charge cycles no matter how you use them it's about the same so keep it plugged in when it's convenient so you can grab it and go and use it like it was intended. When it's toast get a new one. Just keep the battery away from excessive heat/complete depletion and your golden. ",
      "Heat is also more of an enemy to fully charged batteries than to the 40-60% charge. It's the same reason your iPod wont hold a charge as long if its been kept in a hot car for a long time. \n\nTL;DR Heat kills batteries fast.",

Computer owners are always told to free up hard drive space, delete all unnecessary files and programs; users are lauded for having sloppy desktops.  Keep it clean!  Keep it neat!  Delete ALL THE THINGS!  However, this practice is not ALWAYS the best approach.  \n\n- The real scoop is that the benefit of running a registry cleaner is often GREATLY over-stated.\n- Registry cleaners can frequently cause more problems than they solve.\n- Computer issues are almost NEVER caused by stray registry entries that are orphaned, inactive, or unnecessary.  \n\nBack in the day where drive space and system memory were at a premium, cleaning the registry would undoubtedly show a limited benefit.  However, with today's systems, the speed or memory gained by scrubbing the registry doesn't show much benefit at all.  I'm not saying there is NO benefit - programs like CCLeaner have a long track record of positive outcomes. I'm just saying that if your computer is running slow - the registry is just about the *LAST* place you want to look.  You need to first rule out things like Spyware/Malware, memory issues, drive space, hardware failure, and more before jacking with the registry.  The risks FAR outweigh the benefits!  Thanks!\n\n(edit - I'm not saying they are totally pointless.  What *I AM* saying is that there are a hundred other things that people need to look at before they start running reg cleaners on their system in an effort to fix problems.  Running a reg cleaner comes up WAY to quickly and way to frequently when the proper advice should center elsewhere.

      "Check the CPU socket on the Mobo for damage, and also the two CPUs for damaged/bent pins.\n\nIts possible that the new CPU had a bent pin or got bent/damaged during installation, which damaged the socket, so when you put the new CPU back in, it isn't making a complete connection. Its also possible that the original CPU got damaged by the socket when you tried reinstalling it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheck the pins and see if any are bent, you may need a magnifying glass, those things are tiny.

By turning it off, **I didn't solve the 70C shutdown**, but even stressing the CPU for longer time won't make it reach 70 degrees.

There have also been some rare trouble with the backplate of the CPU/APU - \\[[https://hardforum.com/threads/ryzen-cpu-temps.1926291/](https://hardforum.com/threads/ryzen-cpu-temps.1926291/) \\] where the configuration with the screws did not tighten down correctly. If this was the case IT WOULD cause the pc to shut down from not having the cooler plate tight enough to the cpu to sink the heat out of it. There is also a possibility that the VRM or supporting chips (RAM included) are overheating and triggering the shutdown. If I ever had a problem like this I throw the kitchen sink at it. (You have good thermal paste seal?) I take a big square house fan(s) - and all the fans in the house and blast the mobo (sounds like airplane engine lol) AND if the PC stays on longer with the 100 mph wind tunnel - at least I know it is an over heating issue! and you can proceed from there. gl",

As u/HostileApostle420 said, depending on their firewall setup, they can probably monitor any traffic your phone is sending over their network, but unless you're using a company phone with some sort of device management system in place, they can't actually look at what's on your phone. So if you're using Facebook on your phone at work, they can \\(again, depending on their firewall setup\\) tell that your phone is talking to Facebook, but they can't peer into your phone and see your high scores in Angry Birds or anything.",
      "It really depends on what firewalls they use. \n\nAn example, my company firewalls can see and log any packet that goes thru them. We don't have it turned on for most of our networks because the logs become insane (and GDPR guidelines). If a blocked catagory gets detected from an ip address then the logging starts.\n\n\nSo yeh it depends, powerful firewalls can capture anything going through them. \nyou would have signed a 'misuse of company computers' or something along those lines. ",
      "Although this has been answered technically (they can only see the traffic and surmise the apps, not the apps themselves), the real answer is that THEY DON'T CARE!!! Really, they're likely not monitoring your wifi use because they don't care and it's not worth the effort.\n",
      "They can not see what apps you have installed and what's going in them unless they have some spyware installed on your phone.\n\nWhat they can see is network traffic.",
      "What would a VPN prevent them from seeing from the network traffic your phone sends and receives?",

      "They can see the network traffic that your phone is submitting through WiFi but not the apps installed directly on your phone.

      "Most traffic will be HTTPS, the contents of this traffic is generally considered secure and can't be viewed by anyone. The source/destination is however know and easily visible on most firewalls. A big exception however is when your company uses deep packet inspection, this requires you to install a certificate to indicate that you trust your company as a certificate authority. Unless your company uses mobile device management software this would have had to be done manually and I hope you'd be aware of that if this is the case."

I cannot in good conscience encourage anyone to break the law, but I can point out that enforcement is by bots that initiate or join the torrent swarm, then note the IP addresses of other members of the swarm and forward those IPs to the ISP, who knows which user account is assigned to which IP. I can also point out that [PeerGuardian blocks known IPs of copyright-enforcement bots](https://sourceforge.net/projects/peerguardian/) and that [VPNs will make it impossible for them to determine your IP address if you do connect to a bot by accident](https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2403388,00.asp).",

They only thing the ISP can tell, is that some one used a particular IP-adress that is linked to your modem. They have absolutely NO idea that it is you personally, they just assume it. A hacker could have gone on to your internet, someone could have cracked the code etc. I'm a lawyer here in Denmark, and I know for a fact, that you can't bring somebody to court, unless you are certain they committed a felony/crime.

      "To an extent it is true. Or at least, it has a tiny grain of truth in it. But, real-world performance is more likely going to favor Comcrap's 75Mbit connection most of the time anyway. \n\nThe way the cable system is laid out, everyone on a block or neighbourhood shares the same 'loop' of coax, just with taps going off to deliver signal to each endpoint. This makes sense for television: Everyone's watching the same thing anyway, so why not just connect customers to the same trunk line? \n\nFor cable Internet, they take a couple of TV stations worth of bandwidth and set it aside for Internet. The modems  on that loop have their own protocol that allows them to share this this bandwidth through either frequency or time division. As it is, the peak network throughput they sell you is quite a bit less than the maximum throughput that bandwidth could support. There's a total of around 300-500 Mbit/sec shared in that last loop for DOCSIS 3.0 modems. That's a reasonable amount, but there will not be quite enough to deliver the advertised speeds to everyone at the same time. The thing is, residential users are not all drawing peak throughput at the same time, which lets them get away with this over-provisioning most of the time. \n\nIs AT&T any better about this? Probably not much. While their copper and fiber lines don't have the same technical restrictions, they *also* over-provision their throughput for residential customers. The only difference is where this happens. Nearly all ISPs can and do over-provision other links within their networks and the transport that they buy on other networks. They can all have a situation where the network starts to slow down when everyone tries to get the advertised throughput at the same time. \n\nOverall, I'd say that Comcast's advertised 75 Mbit/sec works out to more real-world throughput that AT&T's 18 Mbit/sec fiber-to-the curb system. At least most of the time. But, both of these numbers say \"up-to\" next to them and that does matter under certain circumstances. ",

      "As others have said, no.\n\nHe was correct that Comcast's 75mbps will fluctuate depending on how many people on your node are using it, but it won't dip down anywhere near 18mbps. I'd say IF you you're able to get close to that 75mbps at any time, then I'd guess at busy times you'd probably see something closer to 50mbps.\n\nHere's some info on fiber lines, but I'm not sure which one applies to AT&T in your area:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x\n\nComcast should be FTTN"

Oh, all the files are there, but they're all corrupt. None of the images load using any image viewer, and no video player will play a single video. It's all here, yet it's all gone. A harsh lesson learned the hard way, to be sure. \n\nIf someone would be kind enough to tell me the best way to simply turn it back to a proper 500gb drive as opposed to the 2gb it's showing up as now, I'd appreciate it. \n\n*******************************************************************************\n\nUPDATE 8 - This is for those of you, few as there may be, who are still monitoring this post for updates. \n\nGetDataBack has been doing it's thing now since Valentines day.    ....literally. An initial scan of the entire drive took about 16 hours, and had to be restarted from scratch because automatic updates was still active and I was only given an option to \"postpone\" a restart every four hours, rather than altogether. I tried staying up until the scan ended, but fell asleep shortly before it finished. When I awoke I found that the scan aborted due to the forced restart, so I had to start it all over again. \n\nAfter scan number two finished, I started scanning and copying over files the large partition it found. This has been going on since Sunday evening, non-stop, and it's still only 61% done because I'm transferring everything via usb 1.0 from one external to another. FUN. But, it's working...albeit RIDICULOUSLY SLOWLY. \n\nOnce the transfer is complete and I've had a chance to see both of how much was saved and lost (due to corruption), I'll share a final update. In the meantime, this...is going to take at least nearly two more days at this rate.....\n\n\n********************************************************************************\n\nUpdate 7 - I stepped away from my computer and this whole mess for a few days and a volunteer will be helping me remotely before too long, when our schedules mesh.

I'll post another update in a few days after the remote assistance. \n\n*******************************************************\n\nUpdate 5 - I'm stilling running the analyze option with Disktest because I don't want to stop it prematurely if it will just make things worse, and I have yet to get any feedback from my fourth update. \n\nI found a step by step guide for the other option, but even this is extremely confusing \n\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec_Step_By_Step\n\n\nWhy isn't there a simple one or two click process?  Are there no programs where you start the app, plug in the drive, scan the f%#ing thing and save what it finds to another drive using a standard windows interface?  \n\nI mean just look at all the options under \"Source partition selection\" in the step by step guide. It shows 15 options, and shows \"size in sectors\" rather than mb's or gb's. How am I going to know which one to choose? How do I select all of them???  I want to retrieve as much as possible.\n\nAnd then there are the PhotoRec options. I have no idea which to go with. Do I go with the paranoid mode? expert mode? keep corrected files?  What do I do to simply get all this stuff back???   :*(\n\n\n*******************************************************\n\nUpdate 4 - Oh for fucks sake, according to this I shouldn't be using testdisk for my problem at all, which makes sense since I wanted to restore files, not partitions. I should be using PhotoRec\n\nhttp://dottech.org/10756/testdisk-photorec-the-most-powerful-doomsday-datapartition-recovery-duo-you-will-ever-use/\n\n\nWHAT I NEED TO KNOW RIGHT NOW - I NEED TO KNOW IF I CAN STOP THE \"ANALYZE\" PROCESS IN TESTDISK without hurting anything so I can start PhotoRec instead. HELP!!!!!!!\n\n********************************************************\n\nUPDATE 3 - Further research on testdisk suggests that this isn't even the proper program I should be messing with. It's for deleted partitions  and non-bootable partitions. I deleted a drive full of FILES  *sighs*   After the analysis I'm likely just going to contact one of the nice individuals who told me I could send them the drive directly, seeing as I have no idea what I'm doing. I don't know what to do at this point. I just want everything back, and I want it back right now. \n\n\n*******************************************************\n\nUPDATE 2 - Since the only comment since my first update was \"You formatted twice? You're fucked\"  (thank you so much for that, how nice of you. Thank you for sending me into panic mode). \n\nSo now I grew impatient and started TestDisk. I found this guide\n\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step\n\n\nand began the process. And now I'm completely at a loss what to do, even with a step by step tutorial in front of me. \n\n1. Create Log - check\n\n2. Disk selection - check  (it showed up as 465gb, which was good)\n\n3. Partition table type selection - Intel / PC - check\n\n4. Current partition table status - analyze - check\n\n\nThis is taking a long time, and I can't understand anything that follows. The guide states that \"quick search\" will be the next option, followed by saving or searching for  further partitions using \"deeper search\". After that, it's all greek to me and I don't follow anything. I don't see anything that tells me  \"here's your data, all is well\". Just a bunch of jargon I can't follow. \n\nI'll update again once the Analyze cycle is complete, and I'll share a screen capture. If any of you would be willing to walk me through the process from that point on while I take things step by step while uploading links to screen caps, I'm willing to give it a try. Otherwise I have no idea what else to scan, which options to choose, what to \"write\"  (or when). As I said, I'm freaking the fuck out and I don't know what I'm doing. I thought running testdisk would be easy and self explanitory, but it all looks like dos to me. \n\n********************************************************\n\nUPDATE 1 - Hello everyone. I've been up a short while and was grateful to see so many suggestions and even a few offers to help me directly in my message box. I may take one of you up on that. \n\nBased on all your suggestions, these are the programs I should try - \n\n\nRecuva\n\nTestDisk\n\nPhotoRec\n\nActive Undelete\n\nGetDataBack\n\nEASUS Data Recovery Wizard\n\nRecover My Files\n\n\nI installed Recuva, nervously plugged in my external, and all that shows up is a 2gb drive. I did a \"deep scan\" but it was done in about 30 seconds. I'm so scared to have this thing plugged in I just pulled it out, which I normally never do. I always remove it properly by \"removing hardware\" by ejecting it properly. \n\nWhat I need to know is this - Can I plug in the external and leave it plugged in for an extended period of time, and try all of the above programs without hurting anything further?  I will NOT save anything else to the drive, but rather scan it with most of the programs above. I'm guessing some are better than others, but all Recuva did was a quick scan of a two gig drive, because that's what it saw. I don't know anything about finding partitions or dealing with them. To \"PotatoesAndOnions\", you said \"you probably just made a 2GB partition on a 500GB drive because the usb stick is 2GB. unpartitioned space won't show up\".  When I plug in the drive, all I see it one 2gb drive. Not the main drive with a smaller partition. \n\nWill scanning the drive with multiple programs hurt the contents of the external further if all I'm doing is scanning in hopes of file recovery?  Is this something I can try with multiple programs to see which works best, or should I opt for the best of the above choices?\n\nI'm treading carefully rather than recklessly, so I won't touch the external until a few of you chime in on my update. I'm glad that some of you have provided hope that not all is lost. \n\nWhich is the best choice for a program that will actually see my drive for what it originally was, and not what I turned it into as a result of my format?  Recuva got a fair amount of votes but it didn't help at all. It seems that testdisk and GetDataBack may be the next best options. \n\nHope to hear from you guys again....\n\n********************************************************\n\n\nI just accidentally formatted a 500 GB external full of wedding photos, priceless family videos, my fathers memorial service, etc. NONE of this was backed up elsewhere. One of the projects I was about to DO right now was begin to back things up, and now this happens right beforehand. \n\nTo top it off, now the 500gb drive is showing up as 2gb!!!!!!  It was originally either ntfs or fat32, and now it's just FAT. I may have even formatted the drive twice in a row, I'm such a dumb fuck. I was TRYING to make a usb boot cd for xp, and I forgot to unplug the external and formatted the wrong one.\n\nI've never felt more sick than I do right now. I did some research and downloaded Active Undelete, but I feel all I'm going to do if I proceed is make things worse. I'm in no position to pay for an expensive recovery service. I need help. I'm not going to touch the drive again in the meantime. I'm on the verge of tears. ",

You can purchase Acronis Home pretty cheap, and with it you can backup the physical drive byte per byte. Once that is done, you can unplug the original external and plug in another 500GB drive that you dont care about. Restore the image to it, and then attempt to do data recovery. If you mess it up, just extract the image back over it and start over. ",

      "Let me guess, usb c to usb c.  This whole thunderbolt terminology is wrong. Thunderbolt is a PCIe channel over a *connector* (recent generations have used usb c, but it's not the only connector used for this).\n\nUsb c is bidirectional, meaning you can plug a supply, or a target in.\n\nI have the og Google Pixel, which has usb c for charging. I also have the Anker, usb c powercore 20k battery pack. If I plug my phone into the charger without any preparation, my phone will *always* charge the Anker.  In order for my Anker to charge my phone, as desired, I have to power on my Anker before I connect it.\n\nLikely your battery pack is able to charge over usb c (I don't know since you never said what one you have), so the default behaviour is to charge the battery pack instead of the other way around.\n\nSo. You need to power on your battery pack to the discharge mode, then connect the c to c cable for your laptop.\n\nThe easiest way, that I've found, to force the pack to discharge only (charging all the things connected) is to connect a relatively low power device to one of the USB A ports. A phone or Bluetooth headset, even a USB fan or something.\n\nOnce that's connected, you will have no problems charging anything you want with any other port.",

Most USB-C chargers (phone chargers, for example) will not be able to charge the laptop, or will do so very slowly, or will only work sometimes.\n\nSimilarly, your laptop charger should never be used to charge a lower power device.\n\nAre you using the original factory charger?",

Many devices are not terribly clever when it comes to choosing which wireless protocol to use, and will need to be manually put on the 5GHz system.\n\nLastly, you should expect a speed increase from 5GHz, but you might get reduced range.

So does other electronics, walls, people... Wifi has to bounce around to get to where it's going and has a hard time if there's interference. I had this exact problem for years, what I did was a little excessive but it worked. Essentially I said fuck it, ran 100 feet of CAT6 under my house into my bedroom up through the floor to another router.

Signal leakage out of the Microwave ---  Meaning the microwave is inadequately shielded, or there's a defect and too much EMI is escaping.\n\n2. The Microwave's  shield may be improperly grounded.... check that it's plugged into a 3-prong outlet and use an outlet tester to verify the outlet is wired correctly.\n\n3.  Poor interference rejection by the wireless AP.\n\n\nSome troubleshooting steps would be to try and move the microwave someplace else   or move the  Router/AP/Client  so they are a further distance from the Microwave.\n\nTry a different Microwave   for test purposes,   and if you find the Microwave to be broken,     then your best bet may be replacing the Microwave with  a heavier built one....\n\n\n\n",

He told me he saw some really intense popups on his computer that he couldn't close out of or leave so he called the number there (you dumb little shit) and the way he explained it was someone had remote access to his computer and was 'running tests'. They said they were from microsoft, but I really strongly suspect that he's been the victim of a scam because he's young and stupid.\n\nHe was blurry on the details at this point, but apparently the guy put a 24 hour security 'thing' on his computer, and stated that he doesn't have virus protection from them so he needs to call back within 24 hours or the 'hackers will get him'. I told him it is undoubtedly a scam as we have ESET NOD on all our computers, but he's inconsolable. \n\nHow should I handle this, he wants to reset the computer but I'm not sure that would take care of it.

If anyone else has experience I would really appreciate some guidance so I don't brick his 1.7k laptop.\n\nEdit: I cannot thank everyone on this sub enough, I went over there and spent a few hours cleaning everything out with the programs people suggested and he says that it's a night and day comparison.

The second is actual real encryption.\n\nIf there is a simple password lock:\n\n* boot to a Windows Disk or USB, preferably of that OS.  If it's 7 boot a 7 disk.\n* Press Shift-F10 once in the install menu. \n* Find the OS drive that contains the Users, Windows, and Program Files folders.\n* Change directory to where the registry is stored....\n* cd \\windows\\system32\\config\n* rename the 5 registry hive files to .bak (sam, security, default, software, system)\n* copy the backed up registry files from the subfolder RegBack into the current folder.\n* reboot without the Windows disk\n\nAfter this run every scan you can.  MalwareBytes Rootkit Scanner.  WebRoot Anywhere Trial, ADWCLeaner (because why not). \n\nWhen this scam first started there was skilled people doing it.  They would delete the backup registry files and restore points. The followers following the scripts in the call centers (like the one recently busted in India) were not as astute. \n\nIf he has been hit with the encryption, he needs to first find out if the variant of crypto virus he has is one that the key has been made available for or has been reverse engineered.  Kaspersky has a list of the variants.\n\nNow.... a lot of people think they know a lot about AV.  \n\nWebRoot Anywhere almost ALWAYS picks up rootkits, crypto, etc before it happens and other AV tends to lag behind or have focus on the things that are easier to spot and less desttructive.\n\n_Unfortunately_, if the variant of crypto is not accounted for by the info from Kaspersky, you need to pay the amount.\n\nThese scumbags unfortunately have a stellar reputation for releasing your data via key when you pay.\n\nEveryone LOVES bitcoin, but it is the fucking thing that enables these assholes to extort people via their data.  There is no trail.  It's money across oceans with no accountability.\n\nI've had an older couple get scammed 14k.  A new mother had her laptop encrypted and had to pay $1800 (3 BC at the time) to get her newborn's photos back.\n\nThis shit has become serious.

Very useful as so far it's the only line of defense against ransomware that actually seems to work.\n\nAlso, and I'm serious about this, you'll have to make fun of your brother for falling for this scam. While this might be entertaining for you, it will help him to remember to not fall into this type of trap again.

What I would do is shut the machine off and take out the hard drive.  Backup all the data and then put the drive back in.  Then mount the drive to another computer and see if the backup registry pre-dates the day of infection.  If it does, you can overwrite the registry and disable the syskey and you can run a virus scan on it and you should be good.

I agree with the fact that your dad is probably a smart man, doesn't change the fact that you should always ask questions. \n\nI'd pay the $200.00 and then drop the coverage if I didn't agree with it. It would be under handed to try and get it repaired for free on his mistake. \n\n\nWhy do I say this? Because I have a Note 4 with a cracked screen and had this EXACT same problem. My deductible is $250.00, I thought it was free until I had them on the phone. It's my fault for not asking about what I bought. Should the employees explain it better? Yes. Has that ever happened in your entire life at any big box store? No, we all know better. \n\nEdit- You have to sign a contract, just glance at it.\n",

      "As a GS agent myself, i can attest to the \"hidden fee\" that is associated with this plan. The problem that I face is that our mobile department tends to sell these to clients and neglects to mention the deductible. I have had to replace a broken phone through Verizon's insurance plan and it was the same price, $200, so its not like your getting railroaded or something. I really think the disconnect comes from people thinking they are getting a ~$600+ phone for free when theirs breaks. \n\nAs for cancelling? I fix computers in the back, so i'm not really sure exactly how to go about cancelling, the first area I would probably look would be the GS number 1 (800) 433-5778. ",

But I've used geek squad protection in anything from phones to cameras or laptops and never had issues. No matter the company you have to read what you're signing and ask questions ",
      "Geek Squad employee. You wanted a loophole, so here it is -- every agent has the ability to opt out of the deductible. Your best strategy here is to be very nice and explain your situation, which is that you were explicitly told there was no deductible (not entirely true, but then again the employee wasn't entirely truthful either). If you try enough employees/stores, eventually someone will do it. Not a perfect solution, but it's your best bet.\n\n\nThat said, I'm sick and tired of hearing people complain about this. Geek Squad is not evil. Almost every phone insurance plan in existence has a deductible like this. If your dad didn't buy the plan, he'd be paying $600-$800 to replace the phone. In fact, for a long time, Best Buy had the best insurance plan of any company out there, before people started abusing it and they had to add the deductible.\n\n\nYou can do whatever you want, but if it were me, I would pay it. You'd be a lot worse off without the coverage. Then call corporate, or send them an email, and let them know about the mobile department employee's mistake; they'll take it seriously. And ask next time to read the terms and conditions.",

How the hell that happened idk, but WoW is running at a decent \\~40 fps and not taking up more than 30&#37; ish of the CPU instead of 100 >\\_> in retrospect I should have paid more attention to the drivers first thing but at least it's fixed!! THANK YOU everyone who helped you're amazing\n\nI purchased an ACER Aspire E15 last fall as a secondary computer to my PC. It's mainly used in my art studio for die cutting, regular printing, and Etsy stuff. I was hoping to do some creative streaming from my studio with this but that doesn't really look like it's gonna happen. Anyway all the heavy lifting is done on my PC.\n\nI would however like to run World of Warcraft on this laptop, just on the lowest settings for basic stuff like fishing and daily quests when I'm away from home. I started WoW 11 years ago on a crap laptop, so I figured this should work fine, but it won't go past 2\u20133 fps on the absolute lowest settings with no addons or background processes/downloads running. It won't even run Stardew Valley either, which is kind of a bummer. It just straight up crashes at the farm select screen. I haven't tested any others.

RKill and Windows Defender both show no issues.\n\nI've tried everything I can think of. Killed everything else running, turned off background downloads in battlenet, did windows updates, got rid of bloatware, checked for malware, used the DISM + system file checker tool. Nothing.\n\nAm I just SoL, or this there anything more I can do to get it running more smoothly?\n\nThank you\n\nETA: resources being used are basically 100&#37; CPU and 60+&#37; memory with WoW running. this is ridic. without WoW running it's at under 10&#37; CPU and \\~30&#37; memory, with Chrome taking up the biggest chunk.

    "post": "Hello. 2 days ago my pc ran into a mysterious problem that I still can't figure out. Someone suggested that I explain the issue in this subreddit. I'm going to be very brief about my situation, so here goes. Hope some of you understand what exactly is wrong and please help me with it.\n\nSo it started like this, 2 days ago When I turned on my pc my display didn't. Almost as if the pc turned on into instand sleep mode. I felt no worries and decided to turn off and then on again. Everything was going fine. Until I started Quake Champions. After a while the pc froze for 2 seconds and then rebooted itself. Something like this never happened before.\n\nSo after automatically rebooting itself, it froze and rebooted twice in the middle of starting windows. At third attempt when it finally managed to boot up windows I decided to shut it down.\n\nI decided to keep my pc off for a while. And after a while when I tried to turn it on again, the same thing repeated. So I had this crazy idea. My keyboard and headphones were kind of new. So I decided to unplug both of them and plug in my very old keyboard instead. Weirdly enough, everything seemed to run smoother now. I could swear it was not placebo. Anyways, even if it seemed smoother windows still was unable to boot up. After explaining this situation to a few friends they suggested re installing windows because constant amount of crashes probably corrupted it. So I did exactly that.\n\nBut, after re installing windows I started facing another issue. I noticed after using it for a couple of minute the display just freezes. Later I realized only the display freezes. Everything seemed run well in the background (Audio cues told me). Someone suggested I reset bios. So I did and that freezing issue was solved. So I decided to plug in my new keyboard and headphone again. If anyone is curious which keyboard and headphone I own, it's [this](http://www.gamdias.com/products-en-gb/combo/poseidon-m1-combo-en-gb).\n\nAfter that, everything seemed to work fine. Until yesterday night, my pc suddenly did exactly what started all of this. When I attempted to run quake, the pc froze and rebooted once again. Now the thing is I've been playing quake all day and nothing seemed to wrong. So it was obviously sudden.\n\nSince then, my pc froze and rebooted about 4 times. I have no idea exactly what causes all this and what manages to suppress it. Everything about my pc except my graphics card is about 7 years old.\n\nI'm not a native english speaker so pardon my mistakes. I hope I get some amount of help around here. My sincerest thanks in advance.\n\n&npsp;\n\nEDIT: Rookie mistake. I forgot add my specs.\n\ni5 2320 @ 3.00 GHz\n\n8gb ram\n\nZotac OC 1050ti\n\nAntec VP 450p PSU\n\nand  P8H67-M LX motherboard\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI think I should explain the BIOS reset part completely.\n\nI did mention after re install windows froze still after using it for a while even tho background processes continued normally. A friend suggested I attempt bios reset since something might've corrupted the display driver internally. So I did.\n\nAfter the bios reset something similar to what happened at the very start of all this mess, happened again. At first attempt of starting the pc after booting up, no display. Second attempt, It froze at windows logon screen. Third attempt, everything seemed to go on perfectly fine for hours, even an entire day. The next situation occured a day after.\n\nEDIT 3: Apparently, It was dust. I'm not joking. I have had this issue for 3 days then I decided to just clean it because why not. Even though, there wasn't a heavy amount of dust in there since I just cleaned it a month ago (It's a 7 year old pc, I've even had gone a year without cleaning it).

    "post": "So my PC was sitting under my desk without the side on, as I was recently upgrading to water cooled. I went to the PC a couple days ago and when I booted, black screen and GPU fan at 100%. I took a quick look inside and noticed a pasty yellow substance on the floor of the case, and a horrible cat pee smell. I whipped out the components, noticed that pretty much everything was covered, so I cleaned everything with Isopropyl Alcohol.\n\nInstead of booting with SLI for testing, I tried the GPUs on their own. The first one worked fine, no issues, the PC runs. But the second GPU just runs at 100% fan speed, and the screen stays black. \n\nWeirdly, it booted, everything seemed to be working fine. I ran FurMark, temperatures were reading fine, then all of a sudden, black screen and 100% fans again. I tried booting again with no luck. Then after about 30 minutes I booted again and it worked, but blacked out again after 2 minutes. \n\nI have tested both PCI slots with the same results. I don't think it's the motherboard or any other components as it works fine with the other GPU. \n\nSince it actually boots, but then crashes after a few minutes, could it be repairable? I hope so.\n\nThanks for any advice \n\nedit: I tried booting them both in SLI, with the working GPU as primary. It boots while the second GPU runs at 100% fan speed. The PC does not see another GPU.

      "I've been having a very similar issue with my 27\" 1440p Acer predator aswell although it happens slightly less frequently (every 10 minutes or so) and in certain games theres also a very small amount of flickering noticable at the bottom of the display. I already had to send one back because of a dead pixel and now I have this issue. I think the TN panels they use just aren't very good to be honest. \n\nI also have another 1440p monitor right next to it that never cuts out so I'm pretty sure my system itself is okay",
      "Ok, it's almost certainly the power supply of the monitor, a small external box. \n\nCleaning the graphics card didnt help, again I could play for an hour or two when the rebooting started again. \n\nSo I checked the monitor power supply and it was pretty hot, too. Just when I was holding it in my hands the reboots instantly increased their frequency, from once every few minutes to once every 10-20 seconds. So I fixed it behind the outlet of the PC case fan for some improvised cooling, and so far the monitor didnt reboot once for an hour now. Maybe Ill glue the thing to an old cpu cooler, although the thing might just be drawing his last breaths, better also check for replacement PSU on the markets.\n\nThanks for all the tips! Ill change this post to solved now.\n\n**IMPORTANT EDIT** (one week later): \nUnfortunately I got it wrong up there. For two days things seemed to work fairly normal, except for the odd reboot about once a day. Then the weather started getting hot again and yesterday the monitor started rebooting at a high frequence (once every 1-2 mins) once again, with both the original and the laptop PSU showing no difference. Tried better cooling with hardly any improvement. So it was now obvious that the monitor itself had to be the culprit. So I started tinkering with the settings of the monitor. I had it on the brightest possible setting. After changing to an ECO power saving preset the reboots dropped again to maybe once per hour. Tried lowering brightness even more and no reboots for several hours but it was too dark for me to enjoy so I set it to ECO again. \n\nBottom line, it seems like the monitor is slowly acting up possibly due to years of usage at hightest brightness. I wonder what kind of component could it be thats now conking out under certain heat and load conditions.\n\nEDIT (two weeks later):\nThe reboots seem to become more frequently. Also Ive noticed that those reboots are strongly linked to whats displayed on screen. Particularly the color green seems to increase the reboot frequency dramatically. When I set the windows desktop background to anything green the reboot frequency instantly goes to at least once per minute, and I can predictably increase the frequency to once per second(!) by chosing a medium bright green. Darkening as well as brightening the green will decrease the frequency. With other background colors or green mixed with other colors the reboots become very rare. Interesting stuff. \n\nIve also tried to connect the monitor to the onboard graphics via VGA cable. The reboots seem slightly less frequent so Im now using this setup.\n\nThen I remembered that a couple of years ago I had already replaced all capacitors on the circuit boards inside the monitor to (successfully) fix a no-boot issue. I found a couple of surplus capacitors and soldered them in yesterday, no change. The backside of the circuit board shows some heat discoloration around two of the capacitors that seem to belong to the power supply. \nBrowsing the internet for similar issues I found a plethora of reports of more or less the same problem with a variety of brands, mostly Acer though, but zero solutions outside of \"buy a new monitor\". \n\nHere's again, in short, the symptoms:\n- monitor randomly reboots (power led goes out for one second, back on, and monitor starts bootup sequence displaying brand names etc)\n- frequency of reboots increases with room temperature, with higher brightness setting, and dramatically with the usage of the color green, when connected via VGA cable it shows a little lower reboot frequency than via DVI\n\nEDIT (next day):\nI found a 0 ct (temporary) fix.\nIn the middle of the discolorated spot on the circuit board was a tiny chip which turned out to be a voltage regulator (MB1484EN). I improvised a heat sink for it by cutting off one of the springy metal strips of the circuit board housing and bending it to a cylinder and glued it on top of the chip in a way that it also gets pressed against the housing in order to dissipate the heat to the large sheet metal of the housing. Im now doing the things that used to provoke the maximum frequency of the reboots for like an hour and not a single reboot has occured. I call that a win :)). If the reboots should come back, I will report.\n\nOf course it's not a safe thing to do. If the heat sink gets lose it will short the circuit and might cause trouble. It's pretty well wedged though thanks to the screws that fix the board so even if the glue doesnt tolerate the heat the thing will probably not wander around.\n(changed flair back to SOLVED again)",

      "I think there may need to be a little time before you get concerned.  \n\nBatteries are a bit more... analog... than we give them credit for, and the numbers you are getting aren't super accurate, dead-on science. There's a lot of soft math in there, and a lot of weird chemistry as well.\nThe battery capacity can't be measured directly. You can't hook a sensor to it that says '500mah' on it. The capacity of a battery is calculated by measuring voltage drop over time with a known load (and the load can affect the capacity - for instance, you can't start a car from a laptop battery, even though they contain enough capacity to do so). AND, the voltage can change based on load, so a computer that's consuming battery as fast as it can won't use the whole battery - once it shuts itself down for low battery, you can wait for the chemistry to recover, and power the laptop back up and run it in 'low power mode' for a while longer.  \nSince the 'load' of your laptop changes based on usage, screen brightness, etc..., and that can fluctuate a lot as you use the thing, the calculations are never exact science, so the mWH measurement SHOULD BE calculated as an average over time. If you read it without enough usage time stirred in, it can give you the wrong impression.\nIn addition, there's a lot of weird stuff that happens 'automagically' by the charge circuitry built into the motherboard/battery - like when the battery is full, it doesn't float at 100% - the computer lets it discharge a bit, then charges it back up, and things like that, in an attempt to 'help' you (I say that because some folks believe this makes the battery last longer, some folks believe it kills the life of the battery so you have to buy another one/new computer) meanwhile, the battery circuitry is reporting that the battery is 'fully charged'. Temperature causes chemical fluctuations too that make it report varying values.  \n\nSo all of these figures are averages - Since your machine is only a week old, it hasn't had enough time to get the values sorted yet. Back in the good'ole'days, the computers used to not even give estimated runtimes or capacities for the first few charge/discharge cycles, and it was pretty common to see the 'percentages' go up and down fast, because they'd be wildly inaccurate until it got it's ranges sorted (and the battery chemistry was also way worse. Ni-Cd and Ni-MH batteries were just baaaaad if you didn't baby them).  \n\nThat all being said, it's also possible that there's a manufacturer defect, and the battery life has been massively shortened. Always be on the lookout for excessive heating (if the power is going IN the laptop, it's coming out as heat or light).\nRun the battery all the way up and down a couple times to give the charge circuit more data and see if that number gets back where you were expecting it.  \nBe aware of what the warranty is on your battery, and don't get screwed, but also don't get too worried. It's *probably* not gonna catch on fire.",

Repeat this a few times, the more times you do, the more accurate the capacity measurements will be.\n\nEdit: breaking in isn't really the right term for this. It's more calibrating anymore.

I won't go into the amount of mitigation this radio station had to perform at no cost to locals who picked up the station's broadcasts on phones and stereos and certain types of non-audio equipment, but if you called them and complained they sent out a contractor who provided isolation gear for the affected equipment, and they usually came within a day.\n\nTelephone repairmen working in the area had to avoid bracing themselves against ungrounded guy wires while working.

      "Automated wordpress attacks are extremely common, like set up a blank wordpress site and you'll probably get 100s of attempts to login per day.\n\nThe best defense is to simply keep your wordpress updated, use strong passwords, and ban the ip after few failed attempts. With those things enabled it's virtually impossible they'll ever get in.\n\nAs far as tracking down the IP, that's harder, since ISPs often rotate IPs for users and you would need police to request information from the ISP as to who was using that IP at that specific time. And even then you'd need to prove that they actually did it and that it wasn't some malware or something. And if they're using VPNs then it's simply too much work and pretty much impossible.

It is time to switch to a newer operating system, whether it's Windows 7/8/8.1, some type of Linux, Mac OS, whatever.\n\nIf it's in your budget, you might be best off getting a new computer (if your computer came with Windows XP, it's probably getting pretty long in the tooth). With a little help from guys at /r/buildapc you could easily put together a decent system for <$500. If you mostly just browse the web, you could switch to some type of tablet and pick up a bluetooth keyboard (or a USB OTG cable, and use your existing keyboard and mouse). There's tons of options for a wide range of budgets.\n\nI understand a lot of people use older hand-me-down machines, or maybe cost is a concern. If that's the case, I highly recommend downloading a live Linux distro and giving it a spin. You can run off of a CD/DVD/USB and not touch anything on your hard drive - if you don't like it, no problem - reboot and you're back in Windows. There's Linux distros geared towards running on older hardware, they could breath new life into your machine.\n\nLong story short, there's a lot of folks asking for help with Windows XP, and my advice for any Windows XP-related problem is to just get off of Windows XP.\n\nEDIT: Should there be an effort to compile a guide for people on Windows XP?

That may help you deduce which DNS server is best for your use. \n\nTo answer your question though, a good reason to use an alternate DNS server is so that you can more quickly resolve DNS names (www.google.com), thus allowing you to access websites a tad faster among other things.

    "post": "Hello all,\n\nFirst time posting here. I'll preface by saying I'm no computer or tech expert by any means, so hang with me and I apologize for any ignorance.\n\nPC info:\n* ASUS|H81I-PLUS LGA 1150 R\n* i5 4570\n* NVIDIA GTX 980\n* Corsair CX500M\n* 1TB HDD\n\nMy issue in a nutshell is that the pc will not power on except for seemingly randomly after endless fiddling. When it does power on, it runs absolutely fine with no hiccups. I ran it for nearly 2 weeks (putting it to sleep frequently) before the power went out due to a storm, which is where I'm at now, unable to power it back on. I'll give a recap of what has happened to date to provide as much info as possible.\n\n\nMy issue arose when i tried to power on my PC after a moderate hiatus. Pressing the power button on the case yielded no response. I tried circumventing the switch by shorting the appropriate pins and got nothing once again. A couple times I pressed the power switch and got some momentary start up with fans spinning, just for it to die before reaching more than half a second of on-time. Cue me unplugging everything, making sure things are seated, etc. \n\nNothing.\n\nDuring my fiddling I accidentally disconnected the power switch wires off the back of the power switch module, and wasn't able to get them back in place. After trying to short the pins with no success I reconnected the power switch cable to the mobo pins.  All this to say, at one point I touched the wires together at the back of the power switch module, and voila- power. No idea why, because I had tried this before. \n\nThings seemed to be going fine, I was utilizing the pc daily with no problems whatsoever, but I was hesitant to power down and move it back from where I was using it temporarily to its original desk space. So I reluctantly powered it down and attempted the \"wire-touch\" again and BAM, it booted right back on. Success! I thought....I moved it across the house and once again it would not power up. I fiddled and fiddled, reseating and checking connections and I eventually got it to power on and I'm not sure how to be honest.\n\nLast night the power went out at my house and here I am again unable to power it on. I have used a multimeter to check all the pins in the 24pin connection of the PSU and they are all within acceptable ranges. I checked the CMOS battery and found that it was ~2.7 VDC (I couldn't find conclusively if this was to low, or if in fact it would affect anything beyond timers anyway). I actually bought a new PSU originally believing mine was bad and that didn't change anything. The little green light on the mobo is illuminated so I know it's getting *some* power. I haven't found any shorts that I can see. \n\nMost recently I let it sit for an hour or so and came back and tried shorting the power switch pins with a screwdriver and the fans spun up each time I touched it for a second or two. During this instance I had only my CPU, RAM and PSU hooked up. That was as far as it ever got. I'm a bit lost here, everybody. \n\n\n\nThanks\n\nEDIT:\n\nThanks for the responses everyone, I will give as many of your suggestions a try as I reasonably can. Failing this, I think I may be taking it in to a professional. I'll let you know what happens!",

The router is in the living room, and my computer is in the office, 5-6 meters away, using wifi. The signal is steady and fine for the most time, but occasionally it drops out for about 2-3 seconds. Sometimes more often than others. I assumed it was a shitty ISP, so didn't look into it.

It allows me to run games on my PC and stream them to the TV in the living room, so I play it from there. I was sitting there with my girlfriend, and suddenly noticed that every time she unlocked her phone, I got that same hiccup. The lag and quality-drop was instant. We tested it several times. Every time she opened her phone, I had extremely poor wifi-signal on my PC in the office. After the initial few seconds, everything is fine, even though she's still on the phone. It just happens as soon as she \"starts up\" the phone from a locked state. She has some Samsung shit. This does not happen with my iPhone.\n\nHow can I solve this?

      "There seems to be some misinformation going around on this thread. I hope people don't believe that Charter, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Verizon, and other various ISPs are just sitting around running Deep Packet Inspection on their own customers to see who is torrenting what. That is not how it works at all.\n\nIt's actually quite simple.\n\nSay, as an example, a user decides to download the latest episode to Game of Thrones ([the single most pirated TV show](http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/04/15/game-of-thrones-sets-piracy-world-record-but-does-hbo-care/) to date). They go to their favorite tracker or indexer, grab the torrent or the magnet link, pop it into their client, and hit the start button.\n\nNow, this torrent in question may have several thousand users in it actively seeding and leeching at anytime. The wonderful thing about torrents, however, is that you get (through what is known as an [announce](https://wiki.vuze.com/w/Announce)) a nice fun list from the tracker of the IP of __every single client__ in the swarm, active or not. [DHT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_DHT#BitTorrent_Protocol_Extension) makes things even more fun.\n\nNow, say I'm Time Warner (not to be confused with Time Warner Cable as they are two entirely separate entities), and I'm not too happy about the mass piracy of my show. To me, this translates to [users who are not paying for my service](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones).\n\nWhat I may then do is retain the services of a law group for the purpose of identifying and targeting the persons who are sharing the files. Now the DMCA only applies to America, so I can only target American users (though they can also contact rights groups in other countries to exercise the laws on the books there).\n\nEnter the firms who operate in this manner. Given the ability to act on their behalf as their legal representative, these firms then begin to [scrape trackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracker_scrape) for the number of peers on a given set of torrents (in this case, more recent episodes of Game of Thrones which are likely to have more users than older episodes). With a list of torrents that contain high volumes of users, they then begin to announce to the tracker, requesting a list of connected clients. They may even act as a peer themselves, and start downloading the files (and even seeding), or they may send junk data to other clients (which will individually block them after their data continues to fail hash checks, but not before their IP is already logged) whilst remaining in the swarm.\n\nOnce they have a logged a significant number of IPs, they then seek to determine the locations of them. Most torrent clients perform rudimentary GeoIP look-ups, but for the amount of numbers they're using, they may likely be performing GeoIP lookups en masse using a service such as that provided by [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-services-and-databases). They then filter for all the USA clients, and may do some rDNS on the IPs to find out where they are registered - or they may look up the IP's whois registration en masse to find out the abuse contact that is listed (think of it as similar to the whois registration on an individual domain, but instead for a whole network).\n\nAt that point, once again, en masse, they start sending out automated notifications to the [abuse or DMCA point-of-contact](https://www.arin.net/knowledge/database.html) containing the time stamp, the torrent url, the page it was retrieved from, the tracker in question (or it's announce url), and the IP of the user, either in-line or with a form letter warning users to cease their activity. This is called an automated response.\n\nAt this point, the Network or Service Provider can do one of a few things. The most common are to either ignore the notice in entirety and send it to [circular filing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_13), or they can forward the notification to their user who happened to have the IP assigned to them at a given time. The latter is the significantly more common response. This used to be the end of it [until the graduated response system came into effect](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/03/graduated-response-deal-steamrollers-towards-july-1-launch) as Rights Holders don't feel that ISPs are doing enough to police their networks ([Some have gone as far as to file FCC complaints for it](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070618/095112.shtml) - though that didn't go so well [in the land of Oz](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/02/studios-crushed-isp-cant-be-forced-to-play-copyright-cop/), and demanded that ISPs kick off repeat pirates).\n\n[Comcast, along with other's](https://torrentfreak.com/isp-six-strikes-anti-piracy-scheme-120803/), voluntarily joined that program. As part of Comcast's take on things, they perform the effective equivalent of a [Man-in-the-Middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) on the user in question, and will pester the user with notifications or flat out deny website access [until further action is taken](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130227/14231422143/comcast-we-wont-terminate-your-account-under-six-strikes-well-just-block-every-single-website.shtml).\n\nRarely, but in other cases, [some studios have chosen](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/oscar-nominated-dallas-buyers-club-sues-31-over-bittorrent-downloads/) to actually pursue pirates in court ([though the success of this tactic has been even more rare](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/30/hurt-locker-piracy-lawsuit-abandoned_n_1392427.html)). [Some other attempts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_v._Tenenbaum), however, [have been more much more successful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records,_Inc._v._Thomas-Rasset). Others go the route of [demanding users pay up or else](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/meet-rightscorp-the-internets-new-for-profit-copyright-cop/).\n\nI hope this helps to clear things up. No, your ISP is not watching you. But there are others who are.

In particular, the M11x is a great laptop even if you *aren't* a gamer; it has wonderful battery life, it's super-portable, and it's got a great CPU for its size category. The fact that it also has a great GPU is just a bonus.",

      "Yep",
      "Depends on your point of view.\n\nFrom a \"can I build the same PC for a better price\" standpoint. They are a ripoff.\n\nHowever, Alienware does make the best effort to make the purchase as pleasing for you as possible. When you buy one of their PC's you get enough extras to make you think you are buying a luxury car, and every Alienware machine I've seen has been a top of the line example of a machine of its generation.\n\nAlienware blows every other PC maker out of the water. No one comes close. Their problem is that you can buy a machine of the same quality without their name on it for a third of the price just by building it yourself.",
      "I have an Asus G74x. Plays skyrim max settings well. Seemed to be priced well? I prefer laptops though. ",
      "Usually you can build a comparable desktop for about 2/3 the price or less. The only thing you can't copy is their brand's cases, but with options like the [Corsair 600T](http://www.corsair.com/pc-cases/graphite-series-pc-case/graphite-series-600t.html) and [NZXT Phantom](http://www.nzxt.com/new/products/crafted_series/phantom), I'd say that there's no reason to even want Alienware's inferior cases. Just look at the specs of what you want, then go to [Newegg](http://www.newegg.com) and build the same thing. You'll notice at least $300 or more in savings. \n\nAlso, Dell consumer support is absolutely terrible. You're better off dealing with Newegg or parts manufacturers during the building process than trying to get Dell to actually replace anything. ",
      "Hmm.  Most pre-built PC's are.  Same with laptops.  If you have the desire and patience to learn how to build a PC yourself, you can check out r/buildapc like most people already recommended.  And there are loads of guides ad walkthroughs on how to pick the right parts, and how to put them together all across the internet.  ",

I thought it was legitimate, because my Gmail account had been hacked into in July. I called the number (877-335-7040) who claimed to be a company called quickfix services, and being super stupid and gullible, I gave the dude remote access to my computer. He showed me that someone had been accessing my Mac via a foreign address (probably him). He said he would secure my computer and get rid of the virus for the low low cost of $199, so naturally I provided him my fucking bank details. Only then did I decide to google the number and found a ton of  scam reports. I immediately closed my computer. They called and asked why, I said they were scammers, they denied it, and I told them I didn't want their service. As far as I know he had access to my computer all of 5 to 8 minutes. I closed that bank account, which I had wanted to do anyway. I changed all my passwords via a different device. I logged into my Mac via safe mode, wifi off, and deleted the download he had used to access my account remotely.  I ran my virus scanner and it said there was no malware.

      "Hi friend, so chances are good based on what you've posted so far, that the onboard graphics is deciding to steal a certain amount of memory from your computer's RAM and reserving it for itself, resulting in the pickle you're in. How I can tell this is based on another answer you gave, the onboard graphics are showing up in the Windows device manager - there's a chance that disabling it there won't help you, depending on how deep in the system the setting for the onboard graphics is set.\n\nSince you can get into Windows, prior to doing this you may wish to upgrade the BIOS to the latest version - if there are any outstanding weird compatibility issues, that may fix the issue, too. Anyway - \n\nCan you get into the BIOS setup, as indicated in this link? :\nhttps://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-pavilion-gaming-690-0000-pc-series/19769765/document/bph07110\n\nI'm *guessing* that you're going to be looking under the \"Advanced\" menu under device options probably. \n\nOption 1:  find the setting you need for Onboard / Integrated graphics and turn it off. The setting should definitely be in the BIOS Setup somewhere.\n\nOption 2: a hail mary here would be to reset your bios settings to factory standard. Since they advertise \"ready out of the box\" there's a chance that doing this will set the settings to what they were originally intended to be -- under the link above, the option there you want to follow is \"Reload default BIOS Setup settings\".\n\nOption not really 3 ... last resort: if you didn't want to return it due to it being a gift you were waiting for, potentially you could look at just upgrading the RAM component of the system. It is expandable and if you're feeling plucky (and watch a tutorial video or two) you can do it yourself.

      "There are so many ways to \"skin a cat\", your situation is common. \n\n Depending on EXACTLY how you wish to implement your battle plan, really depends on what you have.  You've stated you have a Modem/Router (from ISP), a Windows 7 laptop, and a wireless Access Point.   \n\n I'll need some more details, as others have asked.  \n\n ISP, really depends.  Since you are at a business location, some ISPs require you to use their modem/router... this is a PITS from the standpoint of \"controlling\" your network.  \n\n I like to put my clients behind their own router/ASA/NSA/gateway.  Whether it's necessary or not, I try to ger my clients a SonicWall TZ series at the very least.  Otherwise, you can always purchase a refurbished Cisco, Linksys, etc for your budget needs.  \n\nA Windows 7 laptop is fine for controlling/configuring, but if you want to host that \"captive page\", you have a few options, all of which take time and effort which you'll spend days to trial and error.  Buckle Up Buttercup, we are in for a Ride. ... Not!  \n\n Stick to keeping that laptop as a means to manage your network. \n\n The Access Point you have really matters here. Ubiquiti, Merkai, etc.  I mean if it is a ole' cheapy Tp-link, or anything, it could possibly only do repeating/bridging and really is just a dumb AP. \n\n So, here is my cheap/quick solution.  Budget?, you'll spend around $150, but you could get cheaper if this is truly a matter you want to get started.   A Linksys WRT..  I have a WRT1900ACS, and it is capable of DD-WRT flashing to custom firmware.  On my suggestion, you can just stick with the factory Linksys firmware, and enable \"Guest Access\".  \n\n This is where not only do you have your personal network 2.4/5Ghz SSIDs, but you can enable Guest 2.4/5Ghz SSIDs which are captured at the Linksys router.  This is the type of setup where you printed the password and you have it shown in the lobby for guests.  \n\n You can even limit access times, and various other options like OpenVPN so you can access the local network while away from the office.   Again, consumer grade, but even the older WRT1900AC can be found for $99, that just \"built-in\" options for what you are asking, seem plausible. \n\nNow, I know you want a CAPTIVE Portal, or possibly your office is larger than the wifi range, so the access point is what you want to dedicate for the guest network. \n\n I can imagine so many scenarios, where what you are asking, does in fact require spending money, no matter how negative your budget is.  If it's that negative, then your business isn't doing well.\n\n Back to my next scenario.  Maybe setting up portal through the laptop, in which you'll have to install a LAMP, or possibly a AMP servicing daemon HTTP.  So your hosting IIS (Windows), you'll not only need to setup more SERVERS for the authentication portal, you have to also have a DHCP that will give out IP addresses.   This is assuming the Access Point, connects directly to the laptop, and the Windows 7 laptop has all of the fun \"functionality\" installed, because it's at least Windows 7 Professional.   Within the Add/Remove Programs and Features window, you'll head to \"add features\", under this next window will possibly be the options to install IIS, and DNS&DHCP services for hosting your own captive portal.  Again, too many ways to do this.  As a Windows Systems Administrator, I swear for all that is holy, you don't do this route.  Sure you can get it to work, but for the Love of Light, a Windows Server is a better way. \n\n  Back to your ISP, they may in-fact have the ability to let you do a \"Guest Network\" through their provided Gateway device. \n\n So, any more detail you can offer, I may be able to help out with what I did when I was in your shoes. ",
      "I always recommend Openmesh. You will not find an easier platform, and it allows you to create your own captive portal so guests have to agree to terms and sign in, you can direct their first page to your website etc, all the stuff you see in hotels and the like.\n\nOr you can just give out a password or voucher.\n\nYou would have to purchase one of their access points, but they\u2019re not terribly expensive. Start at less than $100 us for a basic one.\n\nThe only caveat is that the new owners, Datto, will be transitioning to a fee-based model - there would be an annual fee for the service just like Meraki and other solutions have.\n\nHowever, if you purchase before the end of the year, you can set yourself up on the free platform and they say it will be maintained for at least 5 years. I think one of the things they will offer with the paid platform is lifetime warranty.\n\nThe software that runs it is open source, and the creators will be releasing their own platform you could transition the hardware over to if you prefer the free model.\n\nI don\u2019t work for them or anything, I just like the product and it\u2019s worked really well for me and my customers. Very low maintenance.",

      "> *I want to create public wifi access with a captive portal login for guests*\n\nYour consumer-grade wireless N AP is probably not capable of that out of the box. There are some that will make a guest wifi, but most aren't offering a captive portal.\n\nReading your reviews, this isn't the job of a Windows web server - something you seem to think is needed to get this done. Usually the router or AP would handle this directly, unless you're in a larger corporate environment - and you're not.\n\nIf you're looking for the simplest way to skin this cat, just get an OpenMesh AP, like an A42. Has all of this built in, internet-based management of all APs, etc. You'd create the normal network and bridge it to your LAN (a checkbox in the openmesh config) and then create the guest network with isolation (2 more checkboxes) and the web portal \n(1-2 more checkboxes) which has a really easy way to edit it or customize it as needed and make it your own.\n\nIt's exactly what you need to do this and manage it as easily as possible.",
      "What you're asking for isn't something you typically will setup manually. It's a feature of certain routers or access points that offer a guest portal. Netgear has it on the cheaper end. Enterprise products like ubiquiti access points and cisco meraki as well. Content filtering to block websites is a whole other ball game. "

I've always thought that she just got a bit depressed or angry sometimes, but I tested it recently and the next day she seemed angry for no reason? \n\nsuper confused, and as privacy and trust is something really important to me, I'd like to know if I'm being paranoid or if I should try and talk to her\n\nsincerely, a not very tech savvy person \n\nedit: I'm so overwhelmed by all the responses, thankyou so much!

My guess is it's an issue with the contact on the key or how the keyboard is connected to the laptop.\n\n\nAnything that would remap or unbind the caps lock key doesn't work, because it gets turned on when the computer turns on and windows is unable to detect any keypresses from the button.  \n\n\nThe only thing that does work is doing something that actually toggles caps lock from windows, like the on screen keyboard.  The problem with this is the on screen keyboard program has locked up like 45 out of 50 times I've tried opening it.\n\n\nOf course, I could just hold down the shift key as I type, but in the long run that just isn't feasible.

My incentive to not get written up or fired was to have a low average call time, not customer retention or positive customer surveys.

Anytime a caller got me off script I would try to get them back on script rather than answering their questions. So if you want to go that route, just do exactly what they say and keep the answers as short as possible. Don't tell them the background, things you've tried, anything that might actually be relevant, because they *have* to get you through the whole script even if you've already tried all of it.

Police involvement is basically an empty threat,  and terrible support from your provider.  To claim hacking is coming from your address,  they should be able to tell you EXACTLY what abuse traffic you are sending,  what IP address, what port, Etc.\n\nAnd if you have a decent firewall, you could examine your traffic logs to figure out which device is generating traffic, OR....

      "I know the popular suggestions are disabling wifi and or running scans on you PC / reformatting. I suggest for your own ISP contract obligations you should disconnect your modem entirely from you coax cable (I'm assuming you have cable internet). This will save your contract and future contracts with said ISP. Especially since you are just guessing at the cause right now. Do this first. Most ISPs don't care about customers and won't let you sign up with them again if you breached contract, or if they claim you did. You can actually disconnect the modem and record the logs that you did so. That way if this is a false positive, which it might be, you have evidence that you modem was disconnected the next time they claim something. Log into it after disconnecting the coax cable. The address for the modem might differ from this but is usually 192.168.100.1. This is different from your router btw. Your routers IP is probably 193.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1. Anyway, go into the modem and into the logs. Either do a download of the logs, copy/past, or print screen the log once your coax cable is disconnected.\n\nWhile this is disconnected you should harden you wifi router by changing the password to something long and random. Use upper case, lower case, numbers and special characters. Make it at least 20 characters. Also be sure you disable WPS if it is turned on. Your WiFi should be set to WPA2 with AES encryption. \n\nAs for the router itself, be sure to change the default password and make sure there is no remote administration allowed. This is usually in the administration tab/panel. \n\nIf you suspect however that your PC is compromised then you should take care of that before messing with your router at all (aside from disconnecting your modem, still do that first). Otherwise if there is a Trojan\u200b or Keylogger, all of your passwords for the router will be known. I would personally back up everything and reformat if you suspect anything.\n\nEdit: As others have said, Flash your router firmware as well. Do this before the router config steps btw. Another thought. If you have any cheap IP cameras or other IOT devices, be sure to take them off of your network. They could be on a botnet as well.\nGood luck. Sorry this is messy btw.

    "post": "Last month I switched from Comcast to AT&T for internet. I paid for 60mbps on Comcast, and got a consistent 50mbps, with 30 in busy hours. I switched because they imposed a 300gb data cap with no other options, which ran my bill up from $116 per month to between $250 and $300 dollars. Ridiculous? I agree. (I'm also currently disputing with them that it's impossible that I could have used so much data, since one of those months it was said I went over I actually had their services disconnected.)\n\nSo I switched to AT&T. In my area of Atlanta, they actually say they can provide 75mbps down. I said fine, and tried it out for a month. I kept the Comcast equipment, though it was disconnected because I wanted to be sure AT&T were being truthful about their speeds. (This was the month I'm disputing Comcast about.) Surely enough, the speeds were very high. Sometimes they dipped down to 30mbps, but typically they were between 65 and 70mbps. I use speedof.me, and I've checked these speeds against some other speed tests.\n\nFast forward to this month, almost immediately after the 30 day trial was over. I start noticing that my Netflix is pixelated and has to stop to buffer, some websites take minutes to load, I have to lower the youtube quality to 480p for it not to buffer endlessly, and my ping goes from 1-3ms to 180-1500ms. Yes, I have had my ping be greater than one second on Civ. I checked my speed and sure enough, it ranges from 300kbps to 3mbps down consistently. That's over the course of the past 2 weeks. It's really frustrating. I have tried resetting my router, hardwiring through ethernet, resetting the modem, everything. Nothing has increased my speed.\n\nI guess I'm writing to ask if there are any people out there that have had this issue, or what to do about it. If anybody knows of a reset that will actually fix the system, I'd love to hear about it. If not, and it is a devious operation on AT&T's end, then please help me figure out what on earth to do about it.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated!",

However, to my dismay not only do I not receive this 20mbps speed, att has actually started to slow down my wifi and has started to disconnect me from the internet on multiple occasions. For example if I am doing my hw online, att randomly decides that I don't need internet anymore and disconnects me. I have had to quarrel with the router in order to get it to work again. And as more and more time passes my internet connection only proves to get worse and worse. And yes I know many of you say it may be an old router; however I make sure to replace it with a new one every year or so. I have contacted att on multiple occasions disputing this lack of internet connection and it actually means a lot to me that this happens. Because a lot of times in my free time when I play games like counter strike, internet connection is incredibly necessary in order to ensure a good game. Yet att surprises me everyday by disconnecting me from the internet. I am honestly sorry you have to deal with these lowered internet speeds. Quite frankly att can be a bitch and tries to pull all these stunts with our wifi. Also if any of you could recommend a better plan or a better internet service provider with another company that would be great, because I no longer have an idea on how to proceed with this.\n\nedit: 18mbps upload, and 1-2 mbps down. sorry for the confusion",

He wasn't checking my house specifically, just the street, but I have yet to notice any speed increase.\n\nThis morning I saw about 4mbps consistently, but since then I've been sitting around 200-400kbps. Still waiting on some results, but the people at AT&T at least agree that this is bullshit.",

You are looking for your \"default gateway\".\n\nMine is a common one, and you might even use the same one: 192.168.1.1.\n\nThe next step is to ping your local router.

Let it run for at least 5-10 minutes, during this period try not to do anything on your local network (visiting a website, playing a game, watching a video, etc).\n\nAfter you have waited for 5-10 minutes you can stop the ping command by activating the command prompt window (just select it) and press Control + C on your keyboard. This will stop the command and it will show you overall statistics. \n\nHere are the stats from my output (was less than 5 minutes, you should have packets sent):\n\n    Ping statistics for 192.168.1.1:\n        Packets: Sent = 177, Received = 177, Lost = 0 (0% loss),\n    Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:\n        Minimum = 1ms, Maximum = 5ms, Average = 2ms\n\nThe first big thing to look at is packet loss.

Your average should be 1-3ms and all numbers should be under 10ms.\n\nI would do this when your network is fine and then when it's not. See if there is any change in your local networks performance.

Now this is where i caught the stupid. I end up in my bios (i have a ga b250m d3h m board) and i disable the internal graphics so the card would work of course. No i have ended up locking my self out visually so if somebody has the same board as me please help me by linking a few screenshots of the bios menu or tell me what order i will have to push some keys to set this straight.

I ran a quick scan on Windows Defender, which completed in about an hour. I tried repeatedly to restore the computer to factory settings, but it kept failing. I tried from both of the usernames they have on the computer, along with both of them in safe mode. Every time I'd choose to restore the computer, it would say it failed and that no data was erased. Then it was time for me to fly home, I started a full scan with Windows Defender. They just sent me a picture. It's about 5% done, and I started this Wednesday at about 10am Pacific time. That is 4 days plus a few hours. If there are any fixes I can try, they have to be fairly easy. My parents are the typical computer non-savvy 60  year olds and they can hardly follow directions.

But as far as I understand it, the data that goes in and out of the VPN server is not encrypted.  \n\nSo wouldn't that mean that the anti-piracy firms that log IP addresses connected to trackers, would see the IP of your VPN, and send the VPN, and the ISP that the VPN server uses, an anti-piracy notice or a settlement demand?\n\nBasically, are VPN servers responsible for the traffic that flows through them, and does it behave as normal detectable traffic?",

By booting from CD instead of booting your OS, you can often find more viruses.",
      "Because nuance is inefficient.\n\n  Many scans will report a single \"threat\" multiple times, either because there are multiple implicated files or because they are detected by more than one process.  You're also likely getting all the numbers lumped together: viruses, trojans, worms, rootkits, all the various grayware, and even the stuff that's just potentially risky (a few scans will flag, though usually not remove, torrent programs and remote access programs, for instance). \n\n Most techs I've known gave up even trying to explain these kinds of distinctions to clients who use \"virus\" to refer to any piece of malicious or annoying software.\n\nLet's say that I'm a tech at a successful repair shop in a populated region.  I'm trying to get 10-20 machines off my work bench everyday.  I run a battery of automated offline scans on everything I can before I start digging around manually.  Unless I've got a good diagnostic reason, it's a waste of my time to read through a dozen logs, per machine, looking for double-counts and identifying each \"threat\".  Log summaries are going to get dumped into notes without much consideration, if everything else in the repair goes smoothly.\n\nThat all said, good techs *are* skimming through log files, looking for anomalies, but if there's nothing out of place I don't fault them for not writing up pages of detail.\n",

But here's a guide that should help: http://documentation.netgear.com/fvs336g/enu/202-10257-01/FVS336G_RM-06-16.html ; to get MAC addresses depending if its a blacklist, just look at your history for connected devices, usually the computer name shows up next to it, so if you see your roommate's PC you can add that MAC to the blocklist. If it's a white list you'll need to google how to find MAC address using CMD prompt and ipconfig /all. Hope this helps!",

      "If you lock yourself out, there is usually a reset pin-hole button on the router. Your roommate may know this and be able to reset your router's settings anytime if you lock him out due to his physical access to the router.\n\nWith this caveat mentioned, there should be several ways to lock him out using the router's configuration. Usually the Wifi and Wired networks can be configured separately. You can use MAC address filtering or turn it to static IP. \n\nSetting it to static IP and choosing to not allow unknown hosts will accomplish the same thing. You typically only allow a list of IP + MAC pairs. The difference is that static IP requires your computer to be configured as static IP with the correct IP and network/gateway info entered to be able to connect. This makes still being able to access the router through the wired plugs easier if you can get MAC address filtering on the wired network instead of being forced to do static IPs. (Static IPs is the opposite of DHCP, which is a system for auto configuring your IP info)."

Two weeks in, the trackpad started cutting in and out, so we took it in since she bought the 3 year Accidental Damage and Handling Protection. They told us it was a software issue and to wait for a windows update. fast forward to July 9th, when we discover that the headphone jack is faulty and will not work at all with any headphones that have a microphone on them. The computer gets sent out, and we receive it like a week and a half later. They had replaced the touchpad and said they couldn't replicate the headphone problems. Since they didn't notify us that they were delivering it, it sat in a UPS Warehouse over the weekend, so we called corporate to make sure that everything had been fixed with it. The customer service rep then called the local store to talk to the tech who had submitted the order. They had no clue what she was talking about. Come to find out, the guy we were speaking with had submitted the order under another employee's ID number. When we asked the manager about it, he told us that it was common practice in order to keep productivity up, and that every employee did not have their own number. Corporate of course, refuted his claim, and even called to talk to techs in the store and everyone agreed he lied to our face. So we took the laptop back to the store, had it sent off yet again and just recieved it a few days ago. They claim they replaced the entire headphone jack board, but the problem is still there, like nothing ever happened. As we have explained to everyone involved, we are leaving on August 20th to volunteer as part of Americorps NCCC, where we will not have a physical address. In the last two days we have spent more than 5 hours in store, and on the phone with best buy, and 3 hours talking to ASUS to get our problem resolved. Best Buy expects us to use up our entire 3 year $350 protection plan in order to replace a defective product that they sold us, and to then purchase a new warranty that will cost another $350, if not more. All we need is a working computer and 3 years of ADH protection, like we payed for. \n\nEDIT:We've escalated it as far as it will go with Best Buy, and are now working on sending it out to Execs.\nREDIT: After emailing several Best Buy Execs, we got a phone call from someone in the Executive office who said that he's launching a full investigation into our issue and that he agrees what we've been put through is ridiculous.",

They gave me a best buy gift card worth the value of the computer. From then on I bought a Dell laptop and haven't had any problems. I will NEVER ever buy any product from Best Buy or ASus ever again.\n\nSomething else to consider: Asus has a manufacturers warranty where they will replace hardware within a set period of time. Something like 90 to 180 days. You shouldn't have to reup on hardware protection. There is also lemon law in the United States about having to send a computer away for repair more than four times in its first year. If you do that, the computer is deemed \"a lemon\" and thus you are entitled a refund. That's the way it is in Maryland, US. Might be different wherever you live.",
      "That headphone issue is common.  It is not a defect in the product, rather a design oversight.  Proper practice would be to put a TRRS jack in there and only attach 3 leads, making it compatible with mic-bearing headphones.  Most manufacturers, to cut off probably 3\u00a2 of cost, use a TRS jack instead.  The connections in the TRS jack, I believe, short out the right ear and the mic, making them either extremely quiet, zero-bass, or useless.  If your headphones have a single button on them, try holding it down.  I'll bet you get audio out of them then (I do on my laptop and desktop with my Altec and Sony earbuds).",

You see, I don't have any money in my steam account just yet, so I downloaded Minecraft as I already bought an account for it years ago.

You can find this in the settings [here](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/accounts) under \"grant access to your account\".\n\nOverall however, your boss needs to be educated on company security.

      "My preference, manual copy and paste of desired files to a USB flash drive or external drive. I loathe external hard drive's built in \"data backup software\". Seems to always miss the most important files and in the event of a complete OS hard drive failure, the auto backup files may end up being as useful as tits on a boar hog.",
      "I have no real, important data. I have an out of computer off site back up I make ever week or two. This saves my pics, music, and video projects. All of my web sites are stored on servers remotely as well as my pc(I take advantage of cloud storage to the extent I can.) And my stream games and some other things can always be redownload without penalty granted all of that stuff is backed up off the pc.\n\nSo in closing, I make a back up off site every few days and take advantage of cloud storage.",
      "For me I have a double backup depending on importance.\n\nI have an internal 2 TB I backup anything I somewhat care about (music, steam files) and the important things.\n\nFor the important things I have a 16 GB USB drive that I keep for that.\n\nI do it all manually because most of it is as simple as copy a bunch of folder and replace all which takes me only a minute or so a day.",
      "First, those who have RAID still need to backup.  RAID is *not* a backup.  More people need to realize this.  For software, I personally love CrashPlan.  I use it to have all my computers have local and offsite backups with no more than 24 hours difference between them.  If you have the money, Windows Home Server is unmatched in terms of backup power (imaged-based) and media storage.",
      "I use Idrive pro.  Every night a differential backup of everything I want to have after the worst case scenario happens.  Set it and forget it!",
      "I backup my data to a NAS. Then I make a copy of it on another computer. And after that I put one more copy on a portable hard disk. All done manually. I imagined that if the HDD containing the original failed, I got the NAS. But if the pc caught fire, the NAS will be gone too (they are side by side). And if the whole house was on fire, the second pc will be destroyed. The portable hard disk will be among one of my items to grab out of the burning house. ",
      "The only precious thing I need to have a backup of is code I write. For that, a git repository (be it on your own server or on github/gitorious) is perfect.",
      "I used to do my backup the manual cut&paste way but it gets tedious having to keep track of several computers and making sure all files are up to date. I've never really trusted available consumer software backup solutions. They either take forever to set up, miss files, propagate all file updates including deletions onto the backup (If you have no cats or children, this might not be a deal breaker) and tend to fuck around by creating archives and restore images instead of just storing my files in such a way that i may access them from locations other than the specific computer.\n\nSo I created my own solution with three goals.\n* Critical data should be automatically backed up and passed on for offsite storage.\n* All backed up data should be easily accessible from anywhere in the world without the risk of compromising the backup or the data getting in the wrong hands.\n* The system needs to be easy to extend and implement.\n\n\nI based it on two FreeBSD server running on a mini-ITX atom board + storage disk(s). Small, silent, cheap and easy to hide away. Users can store and access files in their home directory and a public directory using NFS and Samba either manually or using backup software/scripts. The server also runs a mercurial repository hosted using lighttpd keeping track of each users home directory and flagged public folders. Each server is then told what part of the other servers repository it should pull and store either manually or through configuration files on the hosting server. Clients can also manually push onto their server in the event that they are outside the internal network.\nCommunication outside the internal network is encrypted and server to server transfers are monitored to ensure available bandwidth for the clients.\n\nIn the case of a total hard drive failure, I simply replace it, apply the image, run the software installation and setup scripts and pulls the configuration and data from the backup server. If necessary I could set up a RAID to ensure redundancy but the main focus on this system is low noise, small size and low power consumption.\nThe beauty is that setting up another node is as easy as running the scripts and telling the server what it should replicate.\nI can have any server replicate any other server or none at all if storage capacity is more important.\n\nCurrently running only two servers total.",
      "I have rsync setup on a cron job to another machine and then have crash plan pro and an external drive. I do a manual back up to the external whenever a major change happens like new software or something otherwise the other 2 backups seem like enough. Any opinions on carbonite?",
      "I use MozyHome. I can set individual files/folders to backup, how often to sync, plus it only uploads the portions of the files that have actually changed.\n\nThere's a free version that's limited to 2GB."

It does track which programs are more often used, but I doubt it really keeps a log.\n\nThe event logs might record some information that could be reported, either by Windows or the program (like errors). If a developer wants to log that information, he can do that, but there's no general rule. Some programs might keep a log somewhere in the temp folder, or in the AppData folder, some might keep them in a database. It really depends on each program.\n\nI've [seen](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/8zk1yy/a_simple_analysis_of_what_local_data_the_photos/) some microsoft apps collect detailed telemetry, which can be accessed from their AppData directory using any SQlite viewer, but again.... it really depends on each application.",
